america
and
defend

life
be
two
of
my
favorite
comedy
.
he
humor
be
of
a
kind
that
be
not
very
prevalent
in
movie
today
,
inundate
as
we
be
with
film
which
revel
in
they
aim
toward
the
lowest
common
denominator
.
you
will
rarely
see
any
slapstick
in
a
albert
brook
film
,
while
the
dialog
will
not
be
as
oppressive
as
in
some
of
the
independent
''
talk
film
''
which
be
find
they
way
into
theater
.
the
situation
in
which
he
character
find
themselves
be
one
we
can
often
identify
with
,
but
even
if
we
can
not
,
brook
have
the
talent
to
make
they
comfortable
,
and
therefore
we
laugh
.
teenager
and
jim
carrey
fan
probably
will
not
find
a
albert
brook
movie
very
funny
,
but
people
who
look
for
more
than
what
we
could
find
on
television
probably
will
.
put
simply
,
brook
'
comedy
be
intelligent
.
mother
be
albert
brook
'
latest
film
,
and
it
do
not
disappoint
.
brook
play
john
henderson
,
a
middle-aged
science
fiction
writer
just
come
off
he
second
divorce
.
he
make
a
attempt
at
date
,
but
fail
miserably
.
he
then
have
dinner
with
he
brother
jeff
-lrb-
rob
morrow
-rrb-
,
a
successful
sport
agent
who
seem
to
live
the
ideal
life
.
jeff
have
a
good
job
,
a
loving
family
,
and
most
of
all
,
a
warm
relationship
with
they
mother
beatrice
-lrb-
debbie
reynold
-rrb-
.
after
dinner
,
john
witness
a
telephone
conversation
between
jeff
and
beatrice
,
and
be
at
the
same
time
amaze
and
sicken
by
how
hunky-dory
the
dialog
be
.
in
comparison
,
beatrice
always
hint
at
a
fault
in
john
and
he
career
every
time
she
talk
with
he
,
and
john
give
it
right
back
to
she
.
at
the
end
of
one
of
they
conversation
where
beatrice
have
just
pick
apart
john
's
life
,
she
say
,
''
i
love
you
,
''
and
john
reply
with
,
''
i
know
you
think
you
do
.
''
the
thing
be
,
beatrice
be
not
overt
with
she
criticism
,
but
instead
give
they
in
that
mother
way
which
be
tantamount
to
nit-picking
and
guilt
loading
.
it
be
the
kind
that
go
something
like
,
''
yes
,
dear
,
i
think
you
do
that
wonderfully
,
but
...
''
it
seem
as
though
nothing
he
do
make
she
happy
.
there
be
always
the
big
but
.
john
believe
that
he
mother
be
somehow
connect
to
he
failed
relationship
with
woman
,
either
because
of
he
flawed
self-esteem
cause
by
he
need
for
validation
,
or
perhaps
because
he
tend
to
unconsciously
seek
out
woman
who
remind
he
of
he
mother
in
a
oedipal
manner
.
he
come
to
the
conclusion
that
since
he
problem
be
root
in
he
boyhood
home
,
he
should
move
back
in
with
he
mother
for
a
while
just
to
see
what
kind
of
feeling
come
out
,
and
by
that
be
able
to
sort
out
why
he
life
be
the
way
it
be
.
''
a
great
experiment
''
,
he
call
it
.
brook
'
own
brand
of
humor
really
shine
in
this
film
,
especially
in
the
interaction
john
have
with
he
mother
.
there
be
a
scene
where
john
have
just
arrive
at
he
mother
's
house
,
and
after
have
drive
from
lo
angele
to
sausalito
,
and
have
explain
to
he
mother
about
the
''
great
experiment
''
,
beatrice
ask
,
''
now
explain
to
I
again
why
you
do
not
want
to
stay
at
a
hotel
.
''
she
still
do
not
get
it
,
and
it
be
absolutely
hilarious
.
in
the
same
scene
,
we
get
little
glance
at
the
life
he
mother
lead
when
she
try
to
feed
he
food
that
be
no
longer
fresh
.
she
apparently
buy
in
great
quantity
and
refrigerate
it
until
the
lettuce
be
wilt
and
the
sherbet
be
iced
over
.
when
john
point
out
the
ice
on
the
sherbet
,
beatrice
tell
he
not
to
worry
about
the
protective
glaze
.
''
you
have
name
the
ice
?
''
ask
john
.
he
be
also
surprise
at
the
variety
of
item
beatrice
keep
in
the
refrigerator
,
such
as
a
twenty-pound
block
of
cheese
.
''
the
freezer
be
a
good
invention
,
''
say
john
,
''
but
it
be
not
suppose
to
be
use
for
everything
.
that
be
why
it
be
smaller
than
the
refrigerator
.
''
it
be
something
most
of
we
find
strangely
familiar
.
brook
be
also
a
master
at
employ
the
non
sequitur
.
for
example
,
in
defend
you
life
,
he
and
meryl
streep
's
character
be
in
a
comedy
club
have
a
discussion
.
when
they
be
finish
and
walk
out
,
brook
cut
to
the
comic
on
stage
who
be
just
at
the
point
of
deliver
he
punch
line
,
''
and
so
the
moral
be
,
if
you
have
to
fart
,
go
outside
!
''
you
do
not
know
what
the
joke
be
because
you
could
not
hear
he
during
the
entire
scene
,
but
i
must
have
laugh
for
the
next
five
minute
,
it
seem
so
out
of
context
.
in
this
film
,
brook
use
the
same
trick
a
couple
of
time
to
open
or
close
a
scene
.
i
do
not
want
to
give
they
away
,
but
suffice
it
to
say
they
work
just
as
well
as
they
have
in
the
past
.
john
's
purpose
for
stay
with
he
mother
be
to
learn
,
and
we
as
the
audience
learn
right
along
with
he
.
he
mother
be
not
the
fascinating
type
to
begin
with
,
but
as
john
spend
more
time
with
she
,
we
learn
thing
about
she
personality
and
she
lifestyle
that
give
she
depth
.
watch
the
character
of
beatrice
unfold
be
every
bit
as
enjoyable
as
the
humor
that
accompany
it
each
step
of
the
way
.
on
screen
,
brook
do
a
excellent
job
play
this
kind
of
character
:
you
get
the
feeling
he
often
believe
he
be
the
only
sane
person
in
a
insane
world
.
in
a
way
,
he
be
very
much
like
yosarian
of
catch-22
,
expect
with
something
of
a
attitude
.
cast
debbie
reynold
as
beatrice
be
perfect
.
she
assume
the
part
with
ease
,
even
move
and
speak
a
little
slowly
,
and
be
just
so
adorable
it
be
hard
to
get
mad
at
she
character
.
this
only
help
the
audience
to
share
the
frustration
john
feel
when
deal
with
she
.
as
he
first
choice
,
brook
originally
want
to
lure
nancy
reagan
out
from
she
acting
retirement
to
play
beatrice
,
but
the
former
actress
and
first
lady
could
not
leave
she
husband
,
who
be
begin
to
show
symptom
of
alzheimer
's
disease
.
that
may
be
just
as
well
,
since
reynold
lend
a
softness
to
the
character
which
enhance
it
immensely
.
rob
morrow
also
do
a
good
job
at
play
the
younger
brother
who
have
always
be
mother
's
favorite
and
,
for
all
he
success
in
he
job
and
family
,
be
slowly
expose
as
a
mama
's
boy
.
the
only
thing
that
hold
this
movie
back
from
be
better
be
a
couple
of
plot
hole
.
a
solid
connection
be
not
really
make
between
john
's
trouble
and
he
reason
for
live
with
he
mother
.
additionally
,
the
end
result
of
the
experiment
do
not
necessarily
jibe
with
the
state
goal
,
and
although
this
may
have
be
sloppy
screenwriting
,
how
can
you
be
mad
at
the
guy
who
also
write
this
?
:
beatrice
:
you
must
think
i
be
some
kind
of
moron
.
john
:
no
,
i
think
you
someone
who
think
i
be
a
moron
.
beatrice
:
well
,
it
take
one
to
know
one
.
