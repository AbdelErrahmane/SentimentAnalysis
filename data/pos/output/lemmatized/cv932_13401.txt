armageddon
,
in
itself
,
symbolize
everything
that
be
wrong
in
modern
filmmaking
.
story
have
be
replace
with
special
effect
;
character
development
get
overshadow
by
bad
dialogue
;
plot
consist
of
a
bunch
of
shit
get
blow
up
.
armageddon
be
as
stupid
,
as
loud
and
as
shallow
as
any
movie
you
'll
see
come
out
this
summer
,
or
maybe
even
any
other
summer
.
but
i
love
every
freak
minute
of
it
.
believe
I
,
i
be
just
as
shock
as
you
be
.
hell
,
i
do
not
even
know
why
i
go
to
see
it
in
the
first
place
.
the
preview
be
so
annoying
that
i
predict
this
be
go
to
be
the
worst
film
of
the
year
,
or
at
least
in
the
running
.
i
be
sorry
,
but
''
somebody
dial
911
!
!
!
''
be
not
quite
the
tag
that
be
go
to
sell
a
movie
.
it
be
not
too
wise
either
to
market
the
film
use
the
movie
's
stupidest
line
-lrb-
''
beam
I
up
scotty
''
-
yeah
,
that
sure
be
great
writing
...
-rrb-
.
i
mean
,
let
's
face
it
;
armageddon
's
preview
rival
the
truman
show
's
as
be
some
of
the
worst
of
the
year
.
neither
of
they
even
come
close
to
do
they
respective
film
justice
.
of
course
,
you
all
know
the
story
.
when
the
earth
be
threaten
with
total
annihilation
via
a
asteroid
the
size
of
texa
,
nasa
call
in
the
we
's
top
oil
driller
-lrb-
!
-rrb-
to
go
into
space
-lrb-
!
-rrb-
and
implant
a
nuclear
device
eight-hundred
and
someodd
foot
into
the
asteroid
-lrb-
!
-rrb-
.
in
the
coarse
of
all
this
mayhem
,
we
be
introduce
to
some
interesting
-
and
not
so
interesting
-
character
.
belong
to
the
former
group
be
rockhound
-lrb-
steve
buscemus
-rrb-
,
a
horny
little
womanize
genius
who
be
always
full
of
wisecrack
,
even
when
fly
into
space
at
a
huge
amount
of
g
's
.
also
,
there
be
the
always
cool-as-hell
billy
bob
thornton
as
dan
truman
,
the
bigwig
at
nasa
who
recruit
all
the
driller
.
he
kind
of
remind
I
of
ed
harri
in
apollo
13
,
only
without
the
intensity
and
great
line
to
deliver
.
then
on
the
flip
side
of
the
coin
be
the
tired
,
contrived
character
of
harry
stamper
-lrb-
bruce
willi
,
who
do
the
whole
movie
employ
with
annoying
accent
i
can
not
quite
place
-rrb-
,
the
leader
of
the
pack
as
well
as
liv
tyler
and
ben
affleck
as
the
token
lover
you
must
have
in
any
summer
movie
.
basically
,
that
be
about
it
.
as
i
say
,
this
be
hardly
a
film
about
plot
.
it
be
another
summer
blockbuster
with
plot
point
that
be
beyond
unbelievable
and
dialogue
and
character
that
be
mostly
completely
wooden
.
case
in
point
:
nasa
do
not
know
that
there
be
even
a
asteroid
on
it
be
way
until
eighteen
day
before
impact
-
huh
?
another
example
:
at
one
point
in
the
movie
,
two
child
be
play
with
toy
space
shuttle
in
front
of
a
poster
of
kennedy
.
how
pretentious
be
that
?
?
?
!
!
!
want
another
one
?
okay
;
before
the
oil
driller
blast
off
into
space
,
one
of
they
start
singing
''
leave
on
a
jet
plane
''
,
and
soon
,
all
the
rest
join
in
.
do
michael
bay
attend
the
school
of
sappy
filmmaking
before
he
make
this
picture
?
but
naturally
,
all
this
sappiness
,
melodrama
and
special
effect
accumulate
to
one
bitchin
'
time
at
the
movie
.
and
do
not
get
I
wrong
-
despite
all
of
the
thing
i
find
wrong
with
armageddon
,
i
still
very
much
enjoy
it
.
so
even
if
you
do
not
win
one
of
mcdonald
's
free
ticket
,
it
be
still
definitely
worth
check
out
.
