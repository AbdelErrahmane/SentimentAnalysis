critique
:
ever
wonder
what
would
happen
if
you
better
half
turn
out
to
be
someone
other
than
the
person
that
you
have
come
to
cherish
and
love
?
well
,
if
you
ever
have
,
then
this
film
be
definitely
for
you
.
it
be
not
the
most
original
premise
in
the
world
,
but
it
be
handle
pretty
well
here
,
and
pretty
quickly
for
that
matter
-lrb-
a
speedy
90
minute
-rrb-
.
i
think
one
of
the
main
reason
this
film
work
for
I
be
the
groundbreaking
performance
by
mark
wahlberg
-lrb-
of
boogie
night
infamy
-lrb-
7
.
5\/10
-rrb-
.
he
completely
capture
all
the
goodness
,
and
badness
,
of
the
main
character
of
this
film
,
and
always
keep
I
want
to
see
more
and
more
of
he
-lrb-
he
performance
score
he
a
solid
nomination
from
he
core
target
audience
,
as
''
best
villain
''
at
the
1997
mtv
movie
award
-rrb-
.
the
soundtrack
be
also
very
effective
in
this
setting
,
and
of
course
,
the
slutty
performance
by
alyssa
milano
be
something
we
could
all
indulge
in
-lrb-
look
for
the
nice
bikini
and
butt
shot
...
if
you
be
into
that
kind
of
thing
,
that
be
:
-rrb-
.
i
do
not
much
care
for
the
father\/david
relationship
which
seem
to
be
a
little
too
contrived
,
but
for
the
most
part
,
i
be
really
into
this
movie
.
then
again
,
daddy
dearest
do
have
one
of
the
coolest
line
in
the
movie
when
he
wife
be
ask
he
what
the
''
big
deal
''
be
about
he
daughter
date
david
.
he
reply
:
''
the
big
deal
be
that
the
guy
give
I
the
creep
,
and
the
girl
be
my
daughter
.
''
good
point
.
all
in
all
,
the
movie
kick
some
fun
ass
,
mindless
as
it
be
,
and
effectively
demonstrate
every
parent
's
worst
nightmare
.
mind
you
,
i
still
can
not
tell
if
reese
witherspoon
be
good
look
or
a
douchebag
,
but
hey
,
life
go
on
.
and
on
a
personal
note
,
we
finally
decide
to
add
some
taco
meat
onto
we
nacho
fiesta
of
usual
,
and
let
I
tell
you
all
...
it
be
a
