the
idea
at
the
center
of
the
devil
's
advocate
,
which
be
,
thus
far
,
one
of
the
three
or
four
best
film
of
1997
,
be
that
no
matter
what
decision
be
make
,
evil
will
triumph
--
god
be
a
trickster
,
satan
be
a
humanist
--
''
the
last
humanist
''
.
he
appear
in
many
guise
,
and
seduce
many
man
and
woman
--
in
he
own
word
,
''
vanity
--
by
far
my
favorite
sin
''
.
al
pacino
play
this
role
with
relish
,
and
get
to
chew
some
delectable
line
-lrb-
''
lemme
givya
a
piece
o
'
inside
wisdom
on
god
...
''
,
''
i
have
a
million
name
...
''
-rrb-
,
as
john
milton
--
the
devil
.
the
main
idea
--
that
he
can
appear
as
anyone
,
in
any
form
-lrb-
in
this
case
,
a
buisness
man
-rrb-
,
harken
mainly
back
to
terry
gilliam
's
the
time
bandit
.
but
the
film
,
be
something
else
,
something
original
.
part
of
what
make
it
so
very
good
,
be
that
it
never
take
itself
too
seriously
--
it
dabble
with
morality
,
vanity
,
death
,
and
child
abuse
,
but
do
not
try
to
become
any
profound
study
of
power
.
this
be
a
marvelous
confection
--
cocky
,
funny
,
think
provoke
.
it
be
also
entertaining
.
there
be
no
way
you
could
possibly
predict
the
end
--
it
pull
back
upon
itself
,
draw
purely
out
of
the
mind
's
eye
.
the
final
shot
be
more
creative
,
more
daring
,
more
challenging
,
then
anything
in
cinema
since
the
white
sock
in
the
coen
's
fargo
.
the
central
theme
be
fascinating
-lrb-
sometimes
reminiscent
of
jame
'
the
turn
of
the
screw
,
and
oate
'
accursed
inhabitant
of
the
house
of
bly
-rrb-
,
and
the
product
that
be
build
around
it
really
wow
.
its
nice
to
know
that
thing
like
this
be
still
be
make
.
