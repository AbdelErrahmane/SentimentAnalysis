one
of
the
best
movie
of
that
year
,
and
be
direct
by
talented
action
director
walter
hill
at
the
peak
of
he
career
,
the
movie
fail
to
leave
as
strong
impression
to
the
future
generation
as
some
other
cinematic
achievement
of
that
same
year
.
the
reason
for
that
probably
lie
in
a
fact
that
this
movie
aged
very
quickly
.
if
walter
hill
's
idea
be
to
warn
the
public
about
problem
of
urban
america
,
he
fail
miserably
.
the
future
be
much
worse
than
he
vision
.
the
youth
gang
,
as
present
in
the
warrior
,
be
far
from
shadowy
army
,
able
to
take
over
entire
city
.
they
member
seem
more
interested
in
unorthodox
fashion
and
they
little
petty
feud
than
such
prosaic
,
and
for
the
public
more
annoying
,
matter
like
crime
.
in
they
vocabulary
,
word
''
arm
''
be
reserve
for
small
knife
and
blunt
object
,
and
only
few
of
they
use
heavy
artillery
like
handgun
.
they
even
have
they
own
,
very
strict
and
detailed
law
,
uphold
more
strictly
than
some
government
do
with
they
own
.
many
people
in
american
city
would
be
more
than
happy
to
see
they
young
criminal
behave
like
those
in
the
warrior
.
some
of
the
critic
who
accuse
hill
of
actually
praise
youth
crime
have
a
lot
argument
in
they
favor
.
despite
those
objection
,
the
warrior
have
all
the
element
of
a
very
good
film
.
the
plot
be
simple
,
and
serve
as
good
basis
for
numerous
action
scene
.
the
fight
be
brilliantly
choreograph
and
quite
realistic
,
although
there
be
not
much
bloodshed
or
gore
in
the
movie
.
editing
be
superb
,

happen
at
quick
pace

the
exception
of

boring
moralistic

mercy
-lrb-
deborah
van
valkenburgh
-rrb-
drag
the
plot
from
straight
action
to
social
drama
territory
.
the
soundtrack
by
barry
de
vorzon
be
very
suggestive
and
recognisable
.
yet
,
the
trademark
of
this
film
be
the
actor
who
show
great
talent
,
although
most
of
they
later
sink
into
anonymity
.
best
know
of
they
be
david

,
whose
superb
and
original
performance
in

subscribe

to
the
role
of
psychopathic

good
,
and

good
contrast

spot
.
all
in
all
,
this
movie
be
perhaps
date
,
yet
in
its
hour
and
half
can
give
a
lot
more
entertainment
than
most
of
the
contemporary
