go
in
sixty
seconds
do
thing
right
from
the
opening
credit
.
in
that
sequence
,
we
get
a
rockin

little
tune
from

,
along
with
some
simple
back
story

filmmaker
can
sometimes
make
or
break
a
film
just
from
its
opening
title
sequence
,
and
this
one
easily
get
you
in
the
mindset
for
a
entertaining
ride
.
and
what
follow
do
not
disappoint
...
cage
turn
in
one
of
he
good
performance
here
-lrb-
he
can
easily
go
either
way
...
good
or
bad
...
i
do
not
know
how
he
do
that
-rrb-
,
and
he
mannerism
and
dialogue
delivery
carry
the
film
along
nicely
.
of
the
support
cast
member
,
angelina
jolie
as
memphi
'
former
love
be
in
the
film
just
to
provide
eye
candy
-lrb-
she
be
definitely
the
hottest
look
grease
monkey
i
have
ever
see
-rrb-
and
robert
duvall
as
memphi
'
former
mentor
be
just
around
to
lend
the
film
some
class
.
also
,
i
be
a
big
fan
of
will
patton
-lrb-
armageddon
,
the
postman
-rrb-
and
would
love
to
see
he
get
a
huge
role
someday
.
none
of
these
three
performer
be
give
much
to
do
unfortunately
.
some
underrated
performer
however
be
give
meaty
support
role
.
delroy
lindo
-lrb-
get
shorty
-rrb-
shine
as
the
exasperated
detective
in
pursuit
of
memphi
,
as
do
timothy
olyphant
-lrb-
go
-rrb-
as
lindo
's
partner
.
i
just
wish
some
of
the
other
character
could
have
be
as
important
.
the
only
real
gripe
i
have
about
the
film
though
be
its
conclusion
...
mainly
because
you
know
how
it
will
end
before
the
opening
credit
even
roll
.
there
be
no
doubt
in
anyone
's
mind
that
the
50
car
will
be
successfully
steal
,
and
the
filmmaker
blow
a
perfectly
good
opportunity
to
add
some
suspense
to
the
picture
by
use
the
''
rival
car
thief
''
plot
line
.
as
it
stand
,
that
story
line
be
wrap
up
about
halfway
through
the
film
in
a
tidy
little
package
.
but
if
i
be
make
this
film
,
i
would
have
have
the
rival
gang
try
to
get
to
the
car
before
memphi
and
he
crew
,
thereby
make
memphi
have
to
improvise
...
thereby
add
some
meat
to
the
plot
.
the
finale
be
essentially
just
a
big
car
chase
,
and
there
just
be
not
way
to
make
car
chase
interesting
anymore
.
it
be
all
be
do
.
the
chase
be
also
shoot
and
edit
in
that
''
jerry
bruckheimer
action
sequence
''
kind
of
way
that
leave
the
audience
wonder
what
specifically
be
go
on
in
the
scene
.
sure
it
be
a
car
chase
,
but
what
exactly
be
the
particulars
of
it
?
it
be
very
hard
to
tell
.
finally
,
there
be
a
stunt
during
this
scene
that
come
close
to
challenge
the
''
bus
jump
the
ramp
''
sequence
from
speed
in
the
''
oh
,
i
do
not
think
so
...
''
department
.
despite
those
minor
complaint
,
go
in
sixty
seconds
be
pure
summer
movie
entertainment
.
it
be
not
think
provoke
,
but
it
be
shiny
,
loud
and
fun
...
just
what
a
summer
flick
should
be
.
