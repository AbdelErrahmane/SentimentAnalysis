a
cinematic
version
of
one
of
john
irving
's
novel
be
always
cause
for
celebration
even
if
,
as
in
the
case
of
''
simon
birch
,
''
the
treatment
be
merely
''
suggest
by
,
''
rather
than
strictly
base
on
,
the
book
.
suggest
mean
that
irving
,
author
of
the
acclaimed
''
the
world
accord
to
garp
,
''
sell
the
rights
to
he
novel
''
a
prayer
for
owen
meany
''
to
the
disney
machine
for
$
1
million
,
but
would
not
grant
they
permission
to
use
either
the
title
or
any
of
the
character
name
.
that
be
a
odd
decision
--
irve
claim
it
be
to
protect
both
himself
and
the
novel
--
but
it
be
one
that
do
not
unduly
harm
the
finish
product
.
irving
's
book
be
rich
and
complex
work
,
full
of
intriguing
,
colorful
character
.
''
a
prayer
for
owen
meany
''
be
no
exception
;
it
tell
the
story
of
a
unusual
boy
--
call
simon
birch
in
the
film
version
--
who
be
uncommonly
small
in
stature
and
possess
a
high-pitched
falsetto
voice
,
''
like
strangle
mouse
.
''
simon
believe
himself
to
be
''
god
's
instrument
,
''
place
on
this
earth
to
somehow
effect
god
's
plan
.
simon
be
play
by
ian
michael
smith
,
who
suffer
from
a
rare
enzyme
disorder
know
as
morquio
syndrome
which
,
among
other
thing
,
prevent
bone
,
ligament
,
and
joint
from
develop
normally
.
smith
's
debilitating
disease
make
he
a
obvious
physical
choice
for
''
simon
birch
''
;
however
,
the
producer
unwisely
favor
form
over
function
--
smith
's
act
ability
be
limit
at
best
.
another
drawback
be
that
in
the
book
,
simon
's
condition
be
describe
the
way
irving
describe
any
of
he
character
--
in
careful
,
loving
detail
.
watch
''
simon
birch
,
''
however
,
create
a
different
feeling
altogether
;
the
audience
be
force
into
a
voyeuristic
relationship
with
the
character
,
surely
something
irve
would
not
have
intend
.
simon
himself
tend
to
be
too
cute
and
irritating
,
a
combination
of
smith
's
rookie
status
as
a
actor
and
the
precocious
one-liner
he
be
force
to
deliver
,
courtesy
mark
steven
johnson
,
the
film
's
director
and
screenwriter
.
fortunately
,
simon
birch
be
not
the
real
star
of
the
film
that
bear
he
name
.
simon
be
more
of
a
catalyst
,
allow
he
co-star
to
shape
the
story
,
and
the
actor
who
fill
those
role
to
turn
in
outstanding
support
performance
,
save
the
film
from
a
obsequious
,
manipulative
destiny
.
first
and
foremost
be
joseph
mazzello
-lrb-
''
jurassic
park
''
-rrb-
,
who
be
nothing
less
than
remarkable
as
simon
's
best
friend
,
joe
.
mazzello
turn
in
a
wonderfully
layered
performance
for
a
14
year
old
,
ripe
with
laughter
,
pain
,
and
tear
;
he
be
certainly
a
emerge
talent
.
ashley
judd
positively
beam
in
she
role
as
rebecca
,
joe
's
single
mother
,
and
oliver
platt
be
warm
and
tender
as
she
boyfriend
,
ben
.
david
strathairn
and
jan
hook
play
the
town
's
reverend
and
Sunday
school
teacher
respectively
and
they
contribution
uphold
the
high
standard
set
by
the
other
.
there
be
even
a
surprising
yet
effective
uncredited
cameo
performance
from
...
well
,
that
would
be
tell
.
perhaps
''
suggest
by
''
the
novel
be
the
appropriate
way
to
go
after
all
,
since
''
simon
birch
''
only
focus
on
one
chapter
,
one
year
,
of
simon
's
extraordinary
life
.
the
film
also
change
the
book
's
end
to
one
that
be
more
melodramatic
,
yet
necessary
give
simon
's
lot
.
the
flavor
of
irving
's
original
novel
remain
,
however
--
the
passion
,
friendship
,
and
insecurity
that
come
with
a
change
of
season
to
the
little
community
of
gravestown
,
maine
,
and
the
engaging
oddball
,
both
big
and
small
,
who
reside
there
.
