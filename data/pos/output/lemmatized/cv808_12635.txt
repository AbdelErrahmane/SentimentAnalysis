that
be
the
question
reversal
of
fortune
ask
you
to
consider
as
it
open
in
a
hospital
ward
,
with
a
comatose
sunny
von
bulow
.
she
be
the
main
narrator
of
the
film
,
in
a
narrative
trick
that
be
extraordinarily
risky
for
schroeder
.
the
dramatic
trick
work
,
as
sunny
von
bulow
narrate
a
compelling
story
of
murder
,
sex
,
unhappiness
,
and
a
lawyer
's
moral
dilemma
as
he
take
a
case
he
think
he
can
not
win
.
jeremy
iron
be
claus
von
bulow
,
in
what
be
he
finest
role
,
and
one
of
the
most
devastingly
evil
performance
in
history
.
he
be
as
hate
as
any
man
alive
,
as
cold
as
a
cucumber
.
he
remorse
for
he
wife
's
comatose
condition
be
nonexistant
,
and
it
be
no
wonder
that
even
he
child
have
difficulty
accept
he
version
of
what
happen
during
christmas
,
1980
.
the
background
to
the
case
be
such
.
during
christmas
of
1979
,
sunny
von
bulow
fall
into
a
deep
coma
from
which
she
recover
and
awake
.
the
same
situation
occur
in
1980
,
only
sunny
never
wake
,
and
probably
never
will
.
when
examine
,
it
be
find
that
she
have
14
time
the
normal
amount
of
insulin
within
she
blood
.
claus
von

be
then
accuse
of
attempt
murder
by
he
stepson
,
convict
,
and
free
on
bail
.
he
immediately
hire
alan
dershowitz
,
the
renowed
harvard
law
professor
,
to
acquit
he
.
ron
silver
be
magnificent
as
a
moral
lawyer
who
can
not
stand
what
have
happen
to
he
.
we
follow
he
through
two
very
different
case
;
the
case
of
the
johnson
case
,
where
two
innocent
kid
be
stand
on
death
row
for
a
crime
they
do
not
commit
,
and
von
bulow
,
who
he
still
have
not
figure
out
.
dershowitz
do
not
know
what
happen
to
sunny
,
and
he
be
extremely
hesitant
to
take
the
case
.
nevertheless
,
he
do
,
base
on
certain
thing
which
happen
during
the
investigative
process
that
deeply
upset
he
.
together
with
a
group
of
law
student
,
dershowitz
concoct
a
defense
and
ultimately
get
the
verdict
reverse
.
silver
's
performance
be
one
of
a
handful
of
solid
role
in
this
deep
film
.
schroeder
direct
on
many
different
level
,
with
multiple
plot
line
which
blend
in
wonderfully
in
the
mind
of
alan
dershowitz
.
there
be
flaw
;
at
time
,
the
film
get
overly
theatrical
.
yet
,
due
to
glenn
close
's
troubled
and
brutally
honest
performance
as
sunny
von
bulow
,
the
use
of
she
comatose
body
as
a
narrator
work
here
fairly
well
.
the
flashback
be
good
,
but
at
time
schroeder
do
not
fill
in
the
blank
.
the
movie
could
have
benefit
with
the
increase
attention
of
certain
development
during
the
film
,
and
it
could
have
use
a
better
ending
.
the
film
progress
wonderfully
before
end
suddenly
,
without
any
intelligent
conclusion
.
the
support
character
be
often
neglect
,
and
dershowitz
's
team
should
have
be
allow
to
grow
character
wise
,
but
schroeder
over-simplify
the
story
and
the
character
.
yet
,
for
all
these
flaw
,
the
film
be
deeply
engrossing
because
of
iron
.
as
von
bulow
,
he
be
brutally
evil
.
anti-semitic
,
prejudiced
,
arrogant
,
protective
,
he
be
a
rotten
,
lie
monster
,
whose
conviction
may
have
be
wrong
legally
,
but
morally
he
be
to
blame
.
iron
play
he
to
a
cold
perfection
,
with
pathetic
attempt
to
gain
moral
support
for
he
claim
to
innocence
.
he
be
a
adulterous
liar
and
a
cheat
who
in
all
likelihood
commit
the
murder
.
however
,
the
genius
of
reversal
of
fortune
come
in
its
distinction
between
moral
culpability
and
legal
responsibility
.
there
be
no
doubt
von
bulow
be
responsible
for
he
wife
's
death
by
year
of
neglect
and
coldness
.
however
,
legally
,
do
he
do
the
murder
?
schroeder
dare
the
viewer
to
make
up
he
own
mind
.
with
all
the
character
flaw
,
reversal
of
fortune
be
a
engrossing
puzzle
because
it
be
intelligent
;
he
want
the
viewer
to
make
up
he
own
mind
.
schroeder
taunt
the
viewer
with
contradictory
revelation
,
and
then
mention
that
the
answer
to
this
compelling
puzzle
shall
be
reveal
when
we
join
sunny
von
bulow
,
in
death
.
for
all
the
fail
dramatic
theatric
,
this
be
one
that
work
beautifully
.
we
do
not
know
what
happen
.
that
sense
of
legal
ambiguousness
,
along
with
von
bulow
's
obvious
moral
guilt
,
be
why
reversalf
fortune
work
.
in
the
end
,
von
bulow
be
as
sadistic
as
ever
.
iron
be
haunting
,
and
that
be
why
reversal
of
fortune
be
so
good
.
