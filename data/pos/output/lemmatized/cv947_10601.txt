,
the
torture
become
somewhat
of
a
honorary
party
for
all
that
be
wrong
in
the
world
of
cheezy
cinema
.
the
purpose
behind
mst3k
be
to
exploit
some
of
the
worst
film
know
-lrb-
even
if
by
very
few
of
we
-rrb-
to
man
.
we
watch
as
the
silhouette
of
mike
,
tom
,
and
crow
sit
in
a
darkened
theater
poke
fun
at
the
movie
go
on
before
they
.
in
this
case
,
it
be
the
1954
sci-fus
film
this
island
earth
.
we
basically
watch
as
we
three
lead
watch
,
only
we
get
the
pleasure
of
eavesdropping
on
they
hilarious
commentary
.
the
plot
behind
the
movie
rip
apart
be
really
quite
irrelevant
,
but
for
the
sake
of
those
who
might
want
to
know
,
i
'll
explain
this
one
.
this
island
earth
be
the
tale
of
two
scientist
,
a
man
and
a
woman
,
who
wind
up
aboard
a
spaceship
whose
crew
intend
to
destroy
the
earth
.
together
the
two
fight
to
survive
as
well
as
save
they
home
planet
.
to
make
mst3k
work
,
the
film-within-the-film
naturally
have
to
be
as
horrible
as
possible
,
and
although
the
tv-series
introduce
we
to
several
worse
film
than
this
island
earth
,
it
be
a
bad
enough
flick
to
bring
about
some
hysterical
cruelty
.
mst3k
,
which
do
not
actually
contain
the
complete
this
island
earth
,
be
a
short
73
minute
,
but
this
be
a
step
very
wisely
take
.
as
funny
as
some
of
they
observation
be
,
it
can
only
go
so
long
.
occasional
break
from
this
island
earth
also
help
the
film
tremendously
.
although
it
take
a
second
to
get
back
into
the
right
mode
after
this
premise
have
be
leave
for
a
moment
,
it
be
better
than
overkill
the
whole
concept
post
haste
.
mst3k
lover
will
likely
hail
the
film
greatly
,
but
if
you
do
not
know
what
you
be
in
for
,
it
could
be
a
jarring
disappointment
.
although
i
think
the
sharp
wit
of
this
film
be
worth
three
star
,
it
be
a
movie
to
be
see
on
home
video
,
late
at
night
when
you
brain
be
not
function
to
full
capacity
anyway
,
and
with
a
large
,
saracastic
crowd
-
new
year
's
at
midnight
for
example
,
which
be
when
i
see
it
.
warning
:
although
mst3k
have
more
to
its
end
credit
than
most
-lrb-
the
three
lead
use
the
credit
to
poke
some
more
fun
-rrb-
,
they
be
actually
more
annoying
than
most
.
the
name
slander
and
asinine
one-liner
be
extremely
unfunny
,
and
after
laugh
for
about
70
minute
straight
,
it
put
a
heavy
damper
on
the
overall
experience
.
most
people
will
likely
stay
to
see
what
the
smart-alec
's
have
to
say
,
but
for
I
,
it
almost
ruin
a
otherwise
good
film
.
