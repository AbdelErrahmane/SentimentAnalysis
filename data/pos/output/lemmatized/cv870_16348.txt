and
i
would
bet

that
if
i
be
to
watch
this
film
again
in
a
year
,
i
would
relate
myself
to
yet
another
predicament
.
just
like
love
itself
,
this
movie
be
distinct
and
appreciate
by
all
on
many
different
level
.
the
actor
in
this
film
be
all
also
very
,
very
good
.
sean
connery
be
solid
as
the
older
man
with
some
issue
to
resolve
,
as
be
gena
rowland
,
as
the
aging
wife
with
trepidation
.
jolie
come
out
of
this

a
star
with
a
great
performance
,
while
philippe
be
as
pretty-boy
as
ever
.
anderson
leave
scully
far
behind
with
she
wonderful
portrayal
of
a
damage
woman
try
to
re-ignite

love
life
,
opposite
a
surprisingly
admirable
performance
by
former
talk-show
host
,
jon
stewart
.
even
denni
quaid
manage
to
step
outside
of
he
overacting
shoe
in
this
film
,
and
offer
a
convincing
show
of
a
man
lose
within
he
own
imagination
.
the
only
piece
of
this
puzzle
which
leave
I
somewhat
detach
,
be
the
part
surround
jay
mohr
,
the
man
die
from
aid
,
and
he
mother
,
ellen
burstyn
.
the
actor
be
fine
,
but
somehow
,
the
piece
seem
out
of
place
within
the
realm
of
everything
else
.
the
ending
of
this
film
be
also
a
little
too
saccharine
for
I
,
but
i
guess
that
be
just
hollywood
.
this
film
be
actually
a
