director

,
have
make
a
excellent
and
thought-provoking
film
,
world
away
from
the
comic
horror
film
which
make
he
name
.
while
there
be
a
couple
of
moment
which
might
remind
one
of
he
earlier
work
,
raimus
have
make
a
intelligent
and
mature
departure
which
will
hopefully
be
a
sign
of
even
greater

base
on

novel
-lrb-
which
i
have
not
read
-rrb-
be
a
fine
example
of
escalate
tension
.
while
it
do
remind
one
of
danny
boyle
's
shallow
grave
without
the
abundance
of
black
humor
,
it
keep
the
drama
that
should
really
be
a
part
of
such
a
story
on
morality
,
or
the
lack
thereof
,
find
in
a
film
with

subject

alar
kivilo
's
cinematography
remind
one
of
joel

ethan
coen
's
fargo
,
with
the
bleak
,
snowy
landscape
almost
become
another
character
.
danny
elfman
also
do
well
with
he
moody
,
finely-written
score
.
if
there
be
a
flaw
in
the
film
,
it
be
that
it
go
on
for
just
a
little
too
long
.
just
when
we
think
that
they
be
about
to
wrap
thing
up
,
raimus
and
smith
decide
to
let
the
film
go
on
a
little
further
.
while
this
be
not
really
a
bad
thing
,
it
do
become
a
little
frustrating
at
time
-lrb-
this
may
have
be
due
to
the
fact
that
i
have
consume
a
large
sprite
beforehand

the
performance
be
excellent

the
usually
annoying
paxton

this
be
a
excellent
showcase
for
thornton
's
fine
skill
as
a
actor
and
a
great
change
in
direction
for
