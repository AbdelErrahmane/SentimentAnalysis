time

the
movie
!
here
be
a
film
that
actually
give
away
most
of
its
plotline
in

and
do
not
really
bring
anything
''
new
''
to
the
forefront
-lrb-
if
you
have
see
flick
like
duel
and
breakdown
,
you
have
cross
this
path
before
-rrb-
,
but

,
believable
character
,

,
thrill
,
chill
,
the

shebang
.
let
's
give
it
up
for
director

,
who
continue
to
put
out
solid
film
every
other
year
-lrb-
if
you
have
not
see
red
rock
west

do
yourself

favor
right
now
,
and
jot
it
down
on
a
piece

convenience
-rrb-
.
and
much
like
that
film
,
this
one
have
a
excellent
premise
and
set
everything
up
at
a
even
pace
.
it

little
bit
of
background
on
each
of
the
main
three
character
,
and
then
show
you
how
one
small
prank
,
can
lead
to
a
whole
lotta
trouble
for

!
paul
walker
really
surprise
I
in
this
movie
,
since
i
have
never
much
thought
of
he
as
anything
more
than
a
pretty
face
-lrb-
and
damn
,
be
it
ever
pretty
or
what
?
!
-rrb-
but
here
,
he
actually
manage
to
put
some
depth
behind
the
look
and
that
be
always
appreciate
in
film
in
which
you
be
so
closely
tie
to
the
main
character
.
sobieskus
be
also
good
,
but
she
be
not
in
the
movie
for
as
long
as
you
would
think
,
but
the
man
who
really
take
this
film
to
another
level
,
be
steve
zahn
.
if
you
have
love
this
guy
as
the
''
goofball
''
in
most
of
he
previous
role
,
you
'll
appreciate
he
even
more
here
,
as
the
dude
who
start
off
as
one
of
the
most
manic
and
excited
human
being
i
have
see
in
quite
some
time
-lrb-
''
this
be
so
awesome
!
!
''
-rrb-
,
only
to
turn
into
a
man
scare
out
of
he
wit
by
the
end
of
the
flick
.
and
speaking
of
the
end
,
boy
,
do
this
movie
deliver
some
chilling
moment
during
its
final
15
click
or
what
?
!
?
the
arrow
and
i
be
practically
in
each
other
arm
-lrb-
well
,
maybe
i
be
exaggerate
,
but
you
catch
my
drift
-rrb-
as
each
minute
bring
about
another
turn
of
event
which
in
turn
,
take
it
all
to
a
even
higher
level
.
once
again
,
kudos
to
director
dahl
for
be
able
to
generate
that
type
of
intensity
,
suspense
and
tension
,
with
a
great
score
,
editing
,
style
and
camerawork
.
plot-wise
,
i
too
do
wonder
how
the
''
bad
guy
''
be
able
to
track
they
so
well
,
but
it
do
not
really
bother
I
all
that
much
-lrb-
you
can
assume
that
he
have
bug
they
car
?
-rrb-
.
but
pretty
much
everything
else
in
the
story
stick
like
glue
and
i
could
not
help
but
put
myself
in
they
shoe
and
appreciate
they
thoroughly
desperate
circumstance
.
a
great
movie
with
a
even
cooler
ending
,
this
film
will
likely
be
remember
as
one
of
the
better
thriller
of
the
year
.
''
this
be
amazing
!
