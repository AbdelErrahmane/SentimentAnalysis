probably
the
most
popular
and
praise
film
of
all
time
,
turn
out
to
be
a
primitive
and
predictable
costume
drama
with
a
dose
of
social
criticism
.
everyone
know
about
the
greatest
and
most
famous
shipping
disaster
of
all

and
the

be
masterfully
craft
by

and

,
he
re-create
the
frightening
atmosphere
of
the
sink

i

very
much
the
emotional
and
brutal
contrast
between

.
and
then
the
ship
go
down
and
the
few
survivor
be
leave
alone
under
the
star
and
the
chill
air
.
however
,
the
actual
disaster
be
happen
almost
at
the
end
of
the
movie
,
while
the
first
two
hour
be
just
beautiful

and
bad
dialogue

meet
jack

-rrb-
-
a
young
american
artist
,
poor
,
brave
and
attractive
.
a
love
story
slowly
emerge
and
the
two
lover
must
not
only
experience
the
difference
between
the
social
class
,
but
also
face
the
greatest
power
on
earth
-
death
.
cameron
could
as
well
have
call
he
picture
''
the
never
end
love
''
or
''
love
at
first
sight
''
,
as
he
concentrate
all
he
energy
on
the
young
couple
,
and
not
on
the
disaster
itself
.
the
plot
be
anything
but
original
and
the
dialogue
sometimes
resemble
a
television
soap-opera
.
the
director
do
not
even
try
to
overcome
he
empty
script
.
because
of
its
primitive
and
predictable
plot
,
titanic
be
totally
depend
on
the
visual
that
truly
be
breathtaking
.
russel
carpenter
's
rich
,
majestic
and
incredibly
detailed
cinematography
be
certainly
award-worthy
.
everything
from
art
direction
to
visual
and
sound
effect
be
a
top
notch
.
but
it
do
not
help
much
when
the
costume
be
more
convincing
than
the
actor
who
wear
they
.
the
actor
be
not
to
blame
,
because
they
character
be
more
like
caricature
,
in
other
word
-
fake
.
jack
be
a
man
with
many
talent
:
he
be
a
talented
artist
,
handsome
,
brave
,
honest
,
strong
,
funny
...
you
name
it
.
he
do
not
have
any
dark
side
,
he
do
not
make
any
mistake
,
that
for
a
second
would
make
he
human
.
jack
be
perfect
,
but
he
be
-
poor
.
on
the
other
hand
we
have
cal
.
he
be
a
bastard
that
treat
rise
as
a
odalisque
and
not
as
he
wife-to-be
.
he
lack
everything
jack
possess
,
but
he
be
--
rich
.
this
childish
contrast
between
the
social
class
be
one
of
those
thing
that
make
titanic
nothing
more
than
a
mediocre
picture
.
cameron
know
precisely
what
we
want
to
see
.
he
film
therefore
contain
certain
minimum
to
draw
a
audience
-
attractive
actor
,
a
''
tragic
love
story
''
,
beautiful
visual
-lrb-
include
expensive
special
effect
-rrb-
,
a
dose
of
social
criticism
,
a
fascinating
historical
event
-lrb-
we
love
true
story
-rrb-
and
last
,
but
not
least
-
a
incredible
media
support
,
which
proclaim
a
average
picture
the
''
greatest
film
of
all
time
''
.
on
the
outside
titanic
look
perfect
,
but
behind
that
sparkling
curtain
of
incredible
visual
-
be
emptiness
-
nothing
to
think
about
.
the
main
weakness
of
this
film
,
which
ironically
become
its
success
,
be
simplicity
.
cameron
enable
we
basic
and
if
you
wish
-
primitive
emotion
:
love
,
hate
,
fear
and
helplessness
.
everyone
understand
the
power
of
love
and
the
threat
to
we
beautiful
couple
be
likewise
imaginable
-
a
sink
ship
.
titanic
be
a
typical
hollywood
production
,
totally
and
completely
dependent
on
visual
perfection
to
hide
its
primitive
plot
.
it
be
a
good
picture
,
but
absolutely
not
a
masterpiece
.
it
be
among
hundred
and
thousand
good
film
release
every
year
,
not
better
or
worse
than
the
average
american
film
.
