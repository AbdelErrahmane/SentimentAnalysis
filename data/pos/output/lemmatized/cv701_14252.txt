-rrb-
modern
society
be
now
inundate
with
more
sex
and
sexuality
than
it
ever
have
be
before
,
from
teenage
sitcom
to
nc-17-rated
film
about
fetish
.
the
biggest
debate
of
the
subject
be
whether
or
not
it
affect
reality
or
just
reflect
it
.
''
you
friend
and
neighbor
''
take
a
different
approach
as
it
be
a
film
that
revolve
almost
entirely
around
sex
and
how
can
be
use
for
both
pain
and
pleasure
even
within
a
small
circle
of
friend
.
one
of
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
film
that
most
be
note
and
analyze
before
the
film
can
really
be
dissect
as
a
whole
be
writer\/director
neil
labute
's
basic
setup
and
some
of
the
unique
method
he
employ
to
tell
the
story
.
firstly
,
and
most
importantly
be
the
fact
the
script
tell
a
rather
complex
,
detailed
story
of
lust
,
betrayal
,
arrogance
,
hypocrisy
,
greed
,
and
just
plain
stupidity
between
six
different
character
-lrb-
three
man
,
three
woman
-rrb-
,
without
hardly
any
support
character
,
-lrb-
a
few
have
a
line
or
two
-rrb-
,
mostly
extra
.
everything
they
do
will
somehow
affect
another
character
and
ultimately
come
full-circle
back
to
themselves
,
whether
it
be
positive
or
negative
.
but
to
just
state
this
be
arbitrary
,
and
explain
and
criticize
the
process
be
difficult
.
labute
's
ability
to
tell
he
story
through
a
few
character
be
a
remarkable
feat
,
but
what
be
specifically
impressive
be
the
fact
the
character
'
name
be
never
reveal
until
the
end
credit
roll
.
for
the
sake
of
this
review
,
i
will
describe
the
character
and
refer
to
they
as
they
main
characteristic
.
another
interesting
accomplishment
be
the
fact
every
scene
take
place
inside
with
limited
focus
.
we
be
always
able
to
tell
where
the
character
be
-lrb-
someone
's
home
,
the
gym
,
a
restaurant
,
hotel
room
,
etc
.
-rrb-
,
but
what
the
city
they
live
in
,
what
year
it
be
,
what
the
society
be
like
,
etc
.
be
relatively
unknown
.
the
film
be
a
complete
character
study
with
the
tight
,
intense
drama
of
the
theater
.
no
one
plot
dominate
the
story
,
which
make
the
first
act
a
bit
tedious
for
its
lack
of
background
.
we
be
simply
drop
in
on
the
character
'
life
and
be
expect
to
figure
out
the
rest
.
the
character
be
a
group
of
middle-class
white
people
who
be
all
successful
at
what
they
do
,
but
they
be
only
concern
right
now
seem
to
be
they
sex
life
.
first
there
be
barry
-lrb-
eckhart
-rrb-
and
mary
-lrb-
brenneman
-rrb-
,
a
married
couple
who
be
go
through
a
dry
spell
not
unlike
many
other
couple
in
other
situation
who
do
not
know
what
they
be
problem
be
.
barry
be
kind
of
a
dorky
businessman
who
love
he
wife
,
and
the
sex
they
have
,
but
do
not
have
a
lot
of
ambition
-
he
just
follow
everyone
else
.
mary
be
a
writer
of
some
sort
,
but
lack
aggression
and
emotion
like
she
husband
and
be
the
meekness
character
,
but
ironically
,
do
not
hesitate
to
commit
adultery
just
to
feel
something
.
labute
's
script
do
a
good
job
in
characterize
mary
and
barry
as
individual
,
but
be
very
light
on
chemistry
and
connection
between
the
two
.
obviously
,
this
be
the
theme
,
which
be
enhance
by
the
actor
'
good
performance
,
but
at
the
same
time
seem
just
a
bit
hollow
.
another
couple
be
jerry
-lrb-
stiller
-rrb-
and
terrus
-lrb-
keener
-rrb-
who
live
together
and
seem
to
have
be
involve
with
each
other
for
a
long
time
,
yet
they
constantly
argue
over
anything
and
everything
.
they
sex
life
be
also
fraught
with
problem
and
for
some
reason
they
continue
to
do
it
throughout
they
infidelitous
relationship
.
if
only
one
aspect
of
the
film
could
use
improvement
,
it
would
be
this
area
.
it
be
natural
for
a
married
couple
to
become
bore
with
each
other
,
but
why
would
two
people
who
can
barely
stand
each
other
continue
to
have
sex
and
live
together
?
what
do
they
ever
see
in
the
other
person
to
begin
with
?
labute
never
really
answer
,
but
since
the
film
be
more
concerned
with
the
payoff
than
the
process
,
it
still
make
for
good
drama
,
tension
,
and
manip
ulation
so
intricate
and
deceitful
it
be
fascinating
.
two
other
character
act
as
catalyst
,
cary
-lrb-
jason
patric
-rrb-
and
cherus
-lrb-
natassja
kinskus
-rrb-
.
cary
be
a
arrogant
,
hostile
sex-maniac
who
define
the
word
''
bastard
.
''
somehow
he
be
able
to
bend
woman
to
he
will
,
either
through
charm
or
just
attitude
,
into
get
he
way
.
he
be
the
kind
of
guy
everyone
should
stay
away
from
as
we
realize
he
be
secretly
pervert
,
but
somehow
barry
find
comfort
in
he
company
,
although
jerry
be
always
nervous
around
he
.
patric
give
a
outstanding
performance
,
so
much
so
that
we
want
to
know
more
about
he
despite
how
intimidating
and
unlikable
he
be
.
cherus
be
a
character
labute
use
as
a
catalyst
to
see
how
the
other
character
react
to
she
.
she
work
in
a
art
museum
and
at
some
point
throughout
the
film
,
each
character
will
engage
she
in
almost
the
exact
same
conversation
and
she
reaction
be
always
different
,
from
become
involve
in
a
relationship
with
one
,
to
brushing
it
off
as
small
talk
with
another
,
to
be
outright
appal
by
yet
another
.
she
be
a
sweet
woman
,
perhaps
the
most
normal
of
any
of
the
character
,
and
although
she
symbolism
be
obvious
,
she
role
as
the
outsider
be
the
most
relatable
.
i
will
not
reveal
who
cheat
on
who
and
how
each
character
be
specifically
affect
by
the
other
'
action
,
as
that
be
the
hook
of
the
film
.
the
first
two
act
begin
to
set
up
the
character
and
each
's
scenario
,
but
it
be
often
difficult
to
tell
what
they
will
do
about
it
and
with
whom
.
the
result
be
sometimes
surprising
,
other
time
predictable
,
but
the
actual
course
of
action
be
always
fascinating
.
for
a
while
everyone
have
they
fun
,
but
ultimately
each
character
's
guilt
,
attitude
,
or
ignorance
will
disserve
they
.
one
of
the
most
important
thing
to
note
be
how
realistic
the
story
be
suppose
to
be
.
since
the
character
only
interact
with
each
other
there
be
not
much
pop
culture
reference
,
as
almost
everything
have
a
deeper
philosophy
behind
it
.
be
we
to
assume
that
these
people
be
,
as
the
title
state
,
we
friend
and
neighbor
?
i
do
not
know
of
anyone
go
through
the
same
situation
as
these
people
.
often
time
the
film
be
not
unlike
a
network
melodrama
,
other
time
situation
be
like
those
not
see
outside
a
porno
movie
.
but
what
this
film
do
have
that
the
other
do
not
be
repercussion
in
the
end
.
although
the
film
create
its
own
reality
,
it
go
to
show
that
even
the
immoral
be
not
immortal
.
in
what
way
''
you
friend
and
neighbor
''
be
suppose
to
work
be
open
to
interpretation
.
it
definitely
have
a
lot
to
say
about
the
price
that
come
with
infidelity
,
but
it
could
have
be
even
better
have
it
expand
on
that
theme
more
specifically
.
still
,
it
be
a
accomplishment
in
film-making
because
it
have
put
a
timeless
theme
into
a
modern
perspective
.
