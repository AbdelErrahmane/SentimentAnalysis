astonishingly
difficult
task
:
they
want
to
write
a
script
about
william
shakespeare
that
parallel
shakespeare
's
work
.
they
also
want
to
poke
fun
at
the
way
all
of
we
envision
shakespeare
:
i
mean
,
really
,
who
do
not
think
of
shakespeare
as
a
guy
seethe
with
so
much
passion
that
he
can
barely
write
a
play
without
explode
into
a
passionate
,
introspective
verbal
couplet
of
iambic
pentameter
?
stoppard
and
norman
be
man
who
love
shakespeare
,
and
they
want
to
make
a
movie
for
everyone
else
who
love
shakespeare
.
and
,
despite
the
difficulty
of
they
task
,
they
have
succeed
.
shakespeare
in
love
be
one
of
the
smartest
,
funniest
,
most
touching
film
of
the
year
.
it
be
so
rare
that
a
picture
with
such
high
aspiration
succeed
in
all
of
its
endeavor
,
but
here
we
have
a
movie
that
define
success
:
it
be
at
once
charmingly
act
and
flawlessly
write
.
it
could
have
be
a
smug
,
self-important
movie
that
pander
to
die-hard
shakespeare
fan
,
but
the
appeal
of
this
film
be
almost
universal
:
if
you
have
ever
read
a
play
by
shakespeare
,
or
know
anything
about
he
life
,
it
be
likely
that
you
'll
find
grand
entertainment
in
shakespeare
in
love
.
joseph
fienne
,
brother
of
ralph
,
star
as
shakespeare
himself
;
he
be
a
delightful
,
irresistible
lad
,
concerned
mostly
with
woman
and
detach
from
life
's
more
serious
problem
-lrb-
debt
,
plague
,
etc
.
-rrb-
.
he
be
commission
to
write
play
for
various
people
:
queen
elizabeth
-lrb-
judus
dench
-rrb-
want
comedy
,
while
local
slimeball
philip
henslowe
-lrb-
geoffrey
rush
-rrb-
need
he
to
write
a
play
so
that
he
can
pay
off
he
debt
to
hugh
fennymann
-lrb-
tom
wilkinson
-rrb-
.
shakespeare
,
however
,
have
trouble
focus
on
he
work
.
he
begin
work
on
a
comedy
about
a
boy
name
romeo
and
a
girl
name
ethel
.
this
all
change
,
however
,
when
he
meet
viola
de
lesseps
-lrb-
a
radiant
gwyneth
paltrow
-rrb-
,
a
young
heiress
set
to
marry
the
financially-oriented
lord
wessex
-lrb-
colin
firth
-rrb-
.
shakespeare
instantly
fall
in
love
with
she
;
he
first
meet
she
when
she
pretend
to
be
a
man
to
try
out
for
the
part
of
romeo
.
he
discover
she
identity
and
confront
she
later
;
she
,
of
course
,
fall
in
love
with
he
,
although
they
love
be
doom
because
she
absolutely
must
marry
the
tyrannical
lord
wessex
.
but
she
continue
to
act
because
she
love
shakespeare
's
write
so
much
,
and
soon
the
production
-lrb-
which
later
become
romeo
and
juliet
-rrb-
be
set
to
be
perform
.
shakespeare
in
love
be
a
amazingly
good
film
,
not
because
it
work
as
great
entertainment
,
but
because
it
pay
attention
to
detail
and
know
its
subject
matter
.
i
be
instantly
win
over
by
joseph
fienne
in
the
lead
role
:
he
have
such
searing
optimism
and
energy
;
he
be
clearly
a
man
who
admire
shakespeare
,
and
even
in
the
shortcoming
that
he
give
he
character
-lrb-
inability
to
turn
away
from
woman
,
attention
deficit
disorder
-rrb-
,
we
sense
a
great
deal
of
affection
and
care
.
he
practically
overflow
with
passion
in
every
scene
.
fienne
be
match
by
paltrow
-lrb-
whose
english
accent
be
so
good
that
wonder
where
she
actually
come
from
-rrb-
;
she
be
a
actress
who
exude
strength
and
conviction
in
every
performance
i
have
see
she
in
.
the
two
performer
work
perfectly
together
,
take
the
passionate
scene
as
far
as
possible
without
make
they
melodramatic
,
and
wring
the
comedic
scene
for
every
conceivable
laugh
.
of
course
,
it
do
not
hurt
that
they
have
a
masterful
script
to
work
with
.
stoppard
,
whose
play
rozencrantz
and
guildenstern
be
dead
inspire
a
interesting
film
,
be
full
of
dry
wit
and
boundless
understate
humor
-lrb-
all
of
he
play
have
similarly
dry
humor
-rrb-
.
the
first
intelligent
step
stoppard
and
norman
take
be
harmonize
the
event
of
the
film
with
romeo
and
juliet
.
one
of
the
funniest
scene
in
the
film
be
a
imitation
of
the
famous
terrace
scene
from
the
play
;
in
the
movie
,
shakespeare
be
bumble
about
while
viola
be
try
to
fend
off
she
nurse
maid
.
director
john
madden
do
a
fantastic
job
dabble
in
slapstick
humor
--
scene
like
these
would
have
seem
obtuse
in
the
hand
of
a
lesser
director
.
i
be
go
to
have
to
see
the
movie
again
;
i
be
certain
there
be
numerous
reference
that
i
miss
.
in
fact
,
i
doubt
it
be
possible
to
gather
everything
with
just
one
view
.
stoppard
be
a
master
of
detail
:
you
'll
notice
familiar
line
place
throughout
the
film
,
not
as
line
of
a
play
,
but
as
dialogue
,
suggest
that
shakespeare
simply
speak
like
that
all
the
time
.
there
be
also
a
brilliant
run
joke
in
which
shakespeare
be
in
constant
competition
with
christopher
marlowe
-lrb-
and
the
fact
that
marlowe
be
play
by
the
openly-homosexual
rupert
everett
be
a
joke
in
of
itself
-rrb-
,
propose
a
slightly
twisted
explanation
to
marlowe
's
mysterious
death
in
a
pub
.
there
be
also
a
scene
feature
a
wide-eyed
dog
that
be
so
funny
that
i
hurt
myself
laugh
.
''
there
be
no
dog
in
this
play
?
''
''
no
!
no
dog
!
''
the
ensemble
cast
be
perhaps
the
strongest
this
year
.
geoffrey
rush
be
nearly
unrecognizable
as
the
detestable
henslowe
;
wilkinson
be
also
hard
to
recognize
,
but
have
a
great
role
as
a
thug
who
take
he
part
as
the
apothecary
so
seriously
.
ben
affleck
,
play
one
of
the
actor
in
the
company
,
show
great
range
,
both
in
he
accent
-lrb-
he
be
almost
as
good
as
paltrow
's
-rrb-
and
in
humor
-lrb-
he
have
some
of
the
best
one-liner
in
the
movie
-rrb-
.
colin
firth
,
always
stick
play
the
sap
,
do
a
good
job
be
hateful
.
judus
dench
,
however
,
have
the
best
supporting
performance
as
queen
elizabeth
:
rarely
have
so
much
depth
be
convey
in
so
few
word
.
my
single
,
minor
complaint
about
shakespeare
in
love
be
that
i
feel
like
i
could
have
be
more
move
by
the
end
.
the
story
be
move
,
but
there
be
a
few
miss
opportunity
in
the
final
scene
.
but
my
quibble
be
not
important
.
what
be
important
be
that
i
acknowledge
the
quality
of
this
picture
,
the
sheer
skill
with
which
it
have
be
write
,
act
,
and
produce
.
shakespeare
in
love
try
so
many
thing
,
and
nail
every
one
of
they
:
it
be
a
film
that
both
love
shakespeare
and
make
fun
of
he
,
a
film
in
which
the
actor
,
writer
,
and
director
be
all
perfectly
in
sync
.
it
be
also
a
movie
that
have
the
potential
to
introduce
a
lot
of
people
to
shakespeare
's
work
in
a
positive
way
,
without
seem
condescending
or
superior
.
i
admire
this
film
not
only
because
it
pass
so
pleasantly
,
but
because
it
have
lofty
aspiration
and
succeed
in
they
.
not
just
any
film
can
poke
fun
at
shakespeare
and
get
away
with
it
.
