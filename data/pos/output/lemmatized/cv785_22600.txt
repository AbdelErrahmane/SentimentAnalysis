generate

the
original
''

win
I
over
because
its
central
theme
reflect
a
grown-up
sensibility
rather
than
the
usual
this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear
.
while
most
kid
'
movie
take
the
position
that
every
person
be
special
and
have
a
extraordinary
destiny
to
fulfill
,
in
''
toy
story
''
buzz
discover
that
he
be
not
special
,
that
he
be
just
like
everyone
else
.
buzz
sink
into
a
suicidal
depression
,
but
woody
show
buzz
that
be
a
toy
be
worthwhile
because
a
toy
be
loved
and
a
toy
make
a
child
happy
.
in
other
word
,
it
be
okay
to
be
ordinary
if
you
have
love
and
a
purpose
in
you
life
.
most
of
we
probably
come
to
the
same
conclusion
when
we
realize
that
we
be
not
space
ranger
and
we
be
never
go
to
be
.
''
toy
story
2
''
address
the
question
raise
by
the
conclusion
draw
by
the
first
movie
.
woody
be
force
to
recognize
that
andy
will
grow
up
and
forget
he
and
that
he
will
likely
be
discard
,
abandon
,
or
seal
up
in
a
dark
box
in
the
attic
.
this
be
another
big
grown-up
theme
:
everything
end
.
the
theme
be
introduce
early
in
the
movie
when
woody
's
arm
be
tear
and
andy
place
he
on
a
shelf
rather
than
take
he
to
cowboy
camp
.
on
the
shelf
,
woody
meet
wheezy
,
who
be
dusty
,
broken
,
and
forget
.
the
other
toy
be
shock
that
woody
have
be
''
shelve
,
''
and
they
worry
that
woody
's
ride
out
to
the
25-cent
box
at
the
yard
sale
be
a
suicide
attempt
.
after
he
be
steal
,
woody
have
to
decide
between
a
long
life
in
a
display
case
and
a
uncertain
future
with
andy
and
he
pal
.
of
course
,
in
spite
of
the
heavy
theme
''
toy
story
2
''
explore
,
it
be
also
very
funny
.
most
of
the
laugh
come
from
the
toy
'
assault
on
al
's
toy
barn
and
on
the
apartment
building
.
the
brief
substitution
of
a
new
,
still
delusional
buzz
be
a
welcome
surprise
;
i
would
wonder
how
a
sequel
could
be
as
funny
as
the
original
without
the
pompous
attitude
buzz
display
in
the
original
.
most
of
the
vocal
performance
be
first-rate
.
tom
hank
stand
out
for
the
level
of
enthusiasm
he
put
into
he
work
.
however
,
one
voice-over
also
stand
out
as
horribly
miscast
.
kelsey
grammer
sound
nothing
like
a
old
prospector
.
although
he
do
a
lot
of
voice-over
work
in
commercial
and
on
''
the
simpson
''
-lrb-
as
sideshow
bob
-rrb-
,
grammer
only
make
slight
variation
on
he
own
voice
.
he
do
not
have
the
range
to
pull
off
a
role
like
stinky
pete
.
the
animation
be
even
better
than
in
the
first
.
especially
impressive
be
the
texture
of
the
figure
.
we
can
now
see
the
difference
between
flesh
and
plastic
;
in
the
first
movie
the
people
look
just
like
the
toy
,
but
now
human
skin
look
soft
and
have
a
slight
bluish
tint
.
we
can
also
see
that
bo
peep
be
porcelain
.
as
you
can
tell
from
the
long-winded
phrasing
common
in
the
merchandising
--
''
disney
and
pixar
's
`
toy
story
2
'
''
--
this
be
pixar
's
come
out
party
.
to
celebrate
they
append
they
first
project
,
a
hilarious
short
about
two
desklamp
and
a
rubber
ball
,
to
the
beginning
of
the
movie
.
they
make
the
short
in
1986
,
which
be
incredible
when
one
consider
the
relatively
primitive
level
of
computer
technology
available
then
.
on
the
downside
,
''
toy
story
2
''
follow
the
formulum
of
the
original
so
closely
that
the
sequel
come
off
a
bit
stale
,
and
some
section
tend
to
drag
.
overall
,
though
,
i
have
a
great
time
and
find
''
story
2
''
to
be
a
worthy
successor
to
the
first
''
toy
story
.

bottom
line
:
this
one
really
be
fun
for
the
whole
family
!
