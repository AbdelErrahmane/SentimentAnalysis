be

where

be
certainly
the
best
science

s
,
and
rank
along
with
the
best
make
in
the
80s
,
such
as
blade
runner
and
the
two
alien
film
.
perhaps
it
?
s
the
best
of
the
both
decade
;
it
have
the
darkness
of
the
alien
film
,
as
well
as
the
visual
and
compelling
story
of

move
beyond
,
i
think
,
because
the
theme
behind
it
be
much
stronger
