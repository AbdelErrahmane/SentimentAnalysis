instead
of
enshrine
the
legend
of
king
arthur
and

of
the

,
it
dethrone
they
by
reveal
arthur
as
a
weak
,
ineffectual
leader
and

chivalry
have
no
place
in

as
that

bresson
begin
he
tale
as
the
knight
of
the
round
table
be
return
,
decimate
,
after
fail
merlin
's
command
to
retrieve
the
holy
grail
,
the
mystical
cup
that
be
fill
with
christ
's
blood
.
bresson
immediately
give
we
he
impression
of
the
essential
meaning
of
the
grail
quest
:
bloodshed
and
failure
.
the
opening
sequence
be
a
series
of
clumsy
,
disjointed
fight
amongst
anonymous
knight
--
a
head
be
hack
off
,
a
stomach
be
impale
,
a
skull
be
split
open
,
skeletal
remains
hang
from
tree
,
and
burn
body
smolder
in
the
ruin
of
a
flaming
house
.
since
the
film
start
with
camelot
in
near-ruin
,
and
take
only
a
hour
and
a
half
to
arrive
at
its
inevitable
conclusion
,
it
do
not
carry
the
grand
,
tragic
resonance
of
other
arthurian
film
.
we
never
get
to
see
camelot
at
the
peak
of
its
power
,
therefore
there
be
no
real
downfall
to
witness
.
but
,
then
again
,
it
be
not
the
name
of
camelot
that
be
evoke
in
the
title
of
the
film
.
rather
,
it
be
lancelot
,
and
bresson
be
more
interested
in
the
internal
battle
within
he
heart
,
than
the
external
downfall
of
a
kingdom
.
lancelot
have
always
be
a
tragic
figure
in
the
arthurian
tale
,
and
bresson
use
he
as
the
central
figure
to
explore
the
battle
between
the
spirit
and
the
flesh
.
the
greatest
of
all
knight
,
he
be
flaw
only
in
he
love
for
arthur
's
wife
,
queen
guinevere
,
and
it
be
that
illicit
affair
that
eventually
cause
the
downfall
of
camelot
.
even
when
lancelot
attempt
to
end
the
affair
with
guinevere
-lrb-
laura
duke
condomina
-rrb-
,
he
only
find
himself
fall
back
into
she
arm
against
he
better
judgment
.
he
know
it
mean
the
destruction
of
the
idealized
kingdom
,
but
he
be
powerless
in
he
passion
.
when
sir
mordr
-lrb-
patrick
bernhard
-rrb-
accuse
lancelot
of
the
affair
,
other
knight
,
include
sir
gawain
-lrb-
humbert
balsan
-rrb-
spring
to
lancelot
's
defense
.
it
be
this
battle
within
the
knight
that
be
the
eventual
undoing
of
the
round
table
;
the
flesh
win
out
over
the
spirit
,
and
the
consequence
be
dire
.
bresson
be
a
intensely
personal
filmmaker
most
interested
in
the
interior
of
man
's
heart
and
mind
.
''
lancelot
of
the
lake
''
be
fill
with
he
particular
trademark
:
a
stripped-down
,
minimalist
style
,
flat
,
expressionless
dialogue
,
and
a
grand
use
of
natural
sound
in
place
of
music
.
he
use
background
music
only
twice
in
the
film
,
during
a
opening
narration
segment
and
during
the
opening
credit
.
the
music
here
be
a
heavy
drumbeat
and
accompany
bagpipe
,
but
the
rest
of
the
film
be
score
with
natural
sound
that
punctuate
the
film
's
thematic
element
:
the
incessant
clanking
and
creaking
of
heavy
armor
,
the
neighing
of
horse
,
the
rhythm
of
hoof
beat
down
dirt
road
,
and
the
natural
chirping
and
whispering
of
the
forest
.
like
most
of
he
other
film
,
bresson
employ
nonprofessional
actor
who
recite
the
dialogue
in
emotionless
,
flat
voice
.
all
the
actor
he
use
in
''
lancelot
of
the
lake
''
have
never
act
before
,
and
with
the
exception
of
patrick
bernhard
,
they
never
act
again
.
never
once
do
they
raise
they
voice
or
put
any
emphasis
on
a
give
word
.
instead
of
use
vocal
inflection
,
bresson
strove
to
create
emotion
through
image
.
in
some
way
,
this
technique
work
;
in
other
way
,
it
do
not
.
the
final
montage
of
arthur
's
man
battle
each
other
be
quite
marvelous
,
and
the
final
image
of
the
knight
in
shine
armor
reduce
to
a
literal
scrap-pile
sum
up
the
entire
film
in
one
moment
.
however
,
other
time
bresson
's
uncompromising
method
be
distract
and
questionable
.
for
instance
,
during
a
important
joust
contest
,
bresson
film
the
majority
of
the
action
so
that
the
only
thing
visible
be
the
horse
'
leg
.
he
do
this
repeatedly
,
open
each
shoot
with
the
same
few
note
from
a
bagpipe
and
the
raising
of
a
different
flag
.
while
there
might
be
symbolic
value
in
this
,
the
result
experience
of
watch
it
can
be
bothersome
.
nevertheless
,
''
lancelot
of
the
lake
''
be
a
fascinating
cinematic
experience
boldly
make
by
a
master
filmmaker
.
bresson
's
style
may
not
be
for
everyone
,
but
one
have
to
respect
he
strength
as
a
artist
.
by
re-evaluate
the
arthurian
legend
and
make
they
he
own
,
he
turn
''
lancelot
of
the
lake
''
into
something
rare
in
modern
cinema
:
a
truly
personal
film
.
