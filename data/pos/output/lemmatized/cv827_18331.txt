it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
a
dilbert-esque
office
comedy
hit
the
screen
.
however
,
rather
than
come
from
dilbert
creator
scott
adam
,
office
space
be
instead
base
on
the
work
of
another
animator
,
mike
judge
,
creator
of
beavi
and
butthead
and
king
of
the
hill
.
in
he
live-action
directoral
debut
,
judge
aptly
spoof
corporate
culture
.
the
story
be
certainly
not
very
involve
,
but
there
be
plenty
of
truth
and
humor
to
fill
the
gap
.
peter
-lrb-
ron
livingston
-rrb-
be
a
programmer
work
at
the
initech
corporation
.
every
day
in
he
mundane
life
be
worse
than
the
one
before
...
in
other
word
,
every
day
be
the
worst
day
in
he
entire
life
.
he
be
stick
in
a
boring
job
with
eight
different
supervisor
,
all
obsess
with
administrative
triviality
.
he
be
smitten
with
joanna
-lrb-
jennifer
aniston
-rrb-
,
a
local
waitress
,
but
have
not
the
gut
to
even
introduce
himself
.
everything
have
simply
make
he
a
complete
,
nervous
wreck
.
but
all
of
that
change
when
,
after
a
unintentionally
over-effective
visit
to
a
hypnotherapist
,
peter
lose
all
of
he
inhibition
.
he
realize
he
lifelong
dream
:
to
do
absolutely
nothing
.
he
begin
to
blatantly
disregard
the
nonsensical
instruction
of
he
boss
,
bill
lumbergh
-lrb-
gary
cole
-rrb-
,
do
whatever
he
feel
like
.
peter
's
friend
and
co-worker
,
samir
-lrb-
ajay
naidu
-rrb-
and
michael
bolton
-lrb-
david
herman
-rrb-
...
no
,
not
that
michael
bolton
,
be
perplex
by
they
friend
's
sudden
change
in
attitude
.
but
,
they
have
larger
thing
to
worry
about
:
rumor
about
that
initech
be
about
to
begin
downsize
...
as
bleak
as
much
of
this
sound
,
let
I
assure
you
that
office
space
be
a
comedy
,
and
quite
a
funny
one
.
although
it
share
the
same
absurdist
office
humor
of
the
dilbert
comic
strip
,
office
space
be
actually
base
loosely
on
the
series
of
milton
cartoon
which
air
on
Saturday
night
life
.
each
mundane
detail
,
take
by
itself
,
seem
completely
,
regrettably
,
plausible
.
yet
,
when
combine
into
a
whole
,
the
picture
which
result
be
absolutely
surreal
.
ron
livingston
tackle
he
role
straight-faced
,
and
become
much
funnier
because
of
it
.
he
character
be
not
simply
be
a
clown
lampoon
around
the
office
,
but
rather
seem
possess
by
a
zen-like
clarity
.
he
be
operate
on
a
higher
plane
,
where
everything
suddenly
make
sense
,
and
from
this
vantage
point
,
he
allow
the
audience
to
smirk
at
the
absurdity
of
life
.
anyone
who
have
have
to
deal
with
the
inefficiency
of
corporate
bureaucracy
,
or
who
have
ever
be
frustrate
with
the
technology
of
modern
life
,
will
recognize
many
of
the
character
and
situation
in
the
film
.
in
fact
,
in
addition
to
be
wildly
humorous
,
the
film
may
actually
prove
to
be
cathartic
.
the
animated
root
of
office
space
show
in
the
film
's
lack
of
complexity
.
most
of
the
character
in
the
film
can
be
quickly
summarize
by
a
particular
personality
quirk
.
one
employee
,
milton
-lrb-
stephen
root
-rrb-
,
be
practically
a
flesh-and-blood
cartoon
.
however
,
despite
they
simple
nature
,
the
character
still
manage
to
be
surprisingly
funny
.
it
be
not
require
to
have
a
corporate
background
to
enjoy
this
film
-lrb-
though
the
situation
may
seem
exceedingly
far-fetched
if
you
be
unfamiliar
with
just
how
close
to
reality
they
really
be
-rrb-
.
the
film
be
flimsy
and
absurd
,
but
also
very
funny
.
