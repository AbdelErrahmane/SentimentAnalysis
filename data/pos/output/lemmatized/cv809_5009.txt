drive
miss
daisy
be
a
movie
about
human
nature
,
aging
,
prejudice
,
and
a
great
many
other
thing
,
but
more
than
anything
it
be
about
a
relationship
:
one
that
span
25
year
,
4
car
,
the
advent
of
civil
rights
,
and
one
gravely
important
33
cent
can
of
salmon
.
daisy
be
strong-willed
and
set
in
she
way
,
and
,
from
the
outset
,
she
be
utterly
oppose
to
the
idea
of
have
a
chauffeur
.
initially
,
she
treat
hoke
with
contempt
,
refuse
to
let
he
drive
she
anywhere
.
once
she
do
get
in
the
car
,
daisy
be
the
ultimate
back-seat
driver
.
to
make
matter
worse
,
she
be
extremely
self-conscious
about
what
other
might
think
if
they
be
to
see
she
be
escort
around
town
by
a
hire
hand
.
eventually
,
however
,
daisy
be
wear
down
by
hoke
's
good-natured
charm
and
infectious
cheer
;
she
soften
and
open
up
to
he
.
tandy
play
the
part
of
daisy
exceedingly
well
,
but
unfortunately
this
feisty
,
cantankerous
character
be
just
a
smidgen
too
commonplace
.
we
have
see
this
woman
countless
time
before
in
other
incarnation
,
from
on
golden
pond
to
cocoon
.
nevertheless
,
tandy
manage
to
put
enough
of
a
personal
stamp
on
the
familiar
character
to
make
it
she
own
.
freeman
,
as
hoke
,
on
the
other
hand
,
give
the
more
distinctive
of
the
two
performance
.
there
be
something
profoundly
move
about
the
way
hoke
maintain
he
pride
and
dignity
in
a
society
which
forbid
he
from
use
public
rest
room
because
of
he
skin
color
.
hoke
be
uneducated
and
illiterate
,
but
freeman
always
suggest
that
there
be
something
more
to
this
man
,
a
inner
strength
beneath
the
simpleton
exterior
.
both
freeman
and
tandy
seem
to
be
in
they
element
,
in
full
command
of
they
natural
charisma
.
they
flirt
with
the
camera
and
dominate
scene
without
overtly
call
attention
to
themselves
.
they
bring
a
light
touch
to
they
humorous
banter
and
to
the
movie
's
gentle
humor
.
at
the
same
time
,
tandy
and
freeman
provide
more
than
a
few
moment
of
truly
poignant
drama
.
in
he
first
dramatic
role
,
dan
aykroyd
be
surprisingly
chubby
and
unexpectedly
effective
as
boolie
,
tandy
's
loving
and
patient
son
.
drama
seem
to
agree
with
aykroyd
;
take
a
break
from
comedy
seem
like
a
good
move
for
the
actor
,
especially
when
you
consider
the
wretched
comedy
he
have
make
recently
-lrb-
ghostbuster
ii
,
the
great
outdoors
,
my
stepmother
be
a
alien
-rrb-
.
the
only
other
significant
character
in
the
film
be
daisy
's
housekeeper
,
idellum
,
marvelously
play
by
esther
rolle
-lrb-
''
good
time
''
-rrb-
,
and
boolie
's
pretentious
wife
,
play
by
pattus
lupone
.
under
the
direction
of
bruce
beresford
-lrb-
crime
of
the
heart
,
tender
mercy
-rrb-
,
drive
miss
daisy
seem
a
bit
stagey
now
and
again
.
but
fortunately
,
beresford
never
forget
he
be
shoot
a
movie
,
and
accordingly
,
he
offer
plenty
of
striking
cinematic
touch
,
such
as
gorgeous
shot
of
flower
,
tree
,
and
tomato
.
in
adapt
driving
miss
daisy
from
the
stage
to
the
screen
,
the
filmmaker
have
achieve
a
delicate
subtlety
.
uhry
understand
that
what
he
character
do
not
say
can
be
just
as
important
as
what
they
do
say
.
beresford
wisely
exercise
restraint
in
the
film
's
dramatic
moment
.
the
movie
tug
at
you
heart
,
but
it
never
go
for
the
jugular
.
the
only
sap
in
drive
miss
daisy
be
in
the
tree
.
