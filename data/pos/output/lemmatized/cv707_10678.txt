the
reunion
film
be
not
a
original
idea
in
any
way
,
shape
,
or
form
.
it
be
be
do
throughout
film
history
over
and
over
again
,
and
have
become
one
of
the
many
sub-genre
,
like
the
prep
school
sub-genre
,
the
angst-filled
teen
sub-genre
,
and
the
slasher
sub-genre
.
what
make
''
peter
's
friend
''
so
remarkable
be
not
how
it
do
not
follow
the
rule
of
this
sub-genre
,
but
how
it
follow
it
so
well
,
and
create
character
that
i
would
not
mind
hang
with
.
what
be
the
rule
of
the
reunion
sub-genre
?
well
...
1
.
you
need
a
group
of
friend
,
most
of
they
married
or
at
least
date
,
and
sometimes
even
marry
or
date
eachother
.
2
.
you
need
to
have
they
bring
back
together
over
some
sort
of
a
crisis
.
3
.
they
be
not
to
have
speak
together
much
since
they
split
apart
.
4
.
the
reunion
have
to
come
in
interval
divisible
by
10
.
5
.
they
all
have
to
be
slightly
to
highly
neurotic
.
6
.
the
reunion
have
to
bring
they
together
,
seperate
they
with
little
crisis
,
then
bring
they
back
together
because
,
after
all
,
they
be
friend
.
7
.
there
have
to
be
some
sex
or
at
least
some
make
out
either
between
the
friend
or
with
other
people
that
be
there
or
be
invite
.
8
.
eightly
,
they
be
all
unhappy
or
marginally
so
.
9
.
there
be
some
sort
of
sexual
tension
amongst
some
of
they
that
be
build
up
over
the
year
.
10
.
the
friend
be
all
wildly
successful
in
the
world
of
entertainment
and
the
art
,
sometimes
internationally
so
.
11
.
the
film
be
fill
with
nostalgic
radio
hit
from
the
time
when
they
be
friend
,
sometimes
cause
they
to
get
together
in
dance\/song
.
since
it
follow
these
rule
so
closely
,
it
will
probably
be
-lrb-
and
have
be
-rrb-
coin
off
as
just
a
''
british
`
big
chill
.
'
''
and
in
some
way
it
be
.
both
follow
the
rule
,
as
i
say
,
and
both
feature
lot
of
bitch
,
big
confessional
,
and
broken
relationship
.
but
while
''
the
big
chill
''
be
,
at
least
to
I
,
a
tad
too
whiny
and
unsatisfying
,
''
peter
's
friend
''
hit
its
mark
,
make
this
film
funny
,
dramatic
,
and
poignant
.
the
friend
of
peter
's
be
all
in
the
same
theater
group
back
in
'82
,
performig
wildly
outrageous
british
act

people
far
too
stick
up
to
enjoy
they

the
opening
scene
have
they

immeadiately
,
he
decide
to
throw
a
giant
reunion
party
,
invite
back
all
he
old
chum
.
of
course
,
all
or
most
of
he
chum
follow
the
tenth
rule
.
andrew

a
actor
who
be
unhappily
marry
to

.
maggie
-lrb-
emma
thompson
-rrb-
be
a
successfuly
publisher
of
self-help
book
,
but
look
like
she
need
they
more
than
she
customer
,
as
she
be
lonely
and
unhappy
.
roger
and
mary
-lrb-
hugh
laurie
and
imelda
staunton
,
who
be
also
marry
in
''
sense
and
sensibility
''
-rrb-
be
marry
,
and
be
the
most
successful
creator
of
jingle
in
the
uk
,
but
have
suffer
a
tragedy
as
one
of
they
newly
bear
twin
have
recently
die
.
and
sarah
-lrb-
alphonsium
emmanuel
-rrb-
be
as
promiscuous
as
ever
,
have
a
new
boyfriend
as
of
two
week
name
brian
-lrb-
tony
slattery
-rrb-
who
be
married
and
want
a
divorce
because
of
she
,
give
she
doubt
.
as
for
peter
,
thing
seem
okay
...
the
film
feature
lot
of
inner-friend
joke
,
and
even
some
old
theater
anecdote
-lrb-
which
i
at
least
find
a
lot
of
fun
in
,
as
i
have
do
lot
of
theater
myself
-rrb-
.
and
there
be
big
confession
,
brawl
between
the
friend
,
and
by
the
end
,
almost
everyone
be
unhappy
,
even
though
some
have
resolve
they
problem
long
before
the
end
-lrb-
which
i
kinda
dig
-rrb-
.
the
final
twist
would
seem
force
a
anti-climactic
,
but
for
some
reason
,
i
feel
the
same
way
the
rest
of
the
friend
do
.
maybe
it
be
because
the
people
in
this
film
be
so
likable
that
i
just
want
to
join
they
clique
.
that
be
really
what
make
''
peter
's
friend
''
so
lovable
:
the
way
you
just
want
to
hang
with
a
group
of
friend
who
can
be
so
dysfuntional
sometimes
,
but
when
someone
be
in
crisis
,
can
come
together
wonderfully
for
one
another
.
it
be
when
you
have
a
giant
crisis
like
this
and
people
want
to
selflessly
help
you
out
instead
of
subtely
push
you
away
that
make
you
realize
you
have
true
friend
,
and
these
people
be
true
friend
.
not
to
mention
kenneth
branagh
be
able
to
make
the
film
seem
nostalgic
for
the
80s
-lrb-
a
decade
i
grow
up
in
,
unfortunately
-rrb-
without
take
we
outside
of
the
90
.
there
be
some
80s
classic
and
anti-classic
like
tear
for
fear
''
everybody
want
to
rule
the
world
,
''
but
unfortunately
no
stupid\/fun
80s
song
-lrb-
i
think
if
i
ever
do
a
80s
reunion
film
,
i
would
put
some
crap
go
go
song
on
,
or
at
least
some
good
old
''
come
on
eileen
''
-rrb-
,
but
this
be
the
british
80s
we
be
talk
about
.
oh
well
.
but
anyway
,
the
direction
be
pretty
good
,
although
nothing
amazing
.
branagh
's
forte
be
really
make
shakespeare
fresh
and
magical
,
but
at
least
he
be
very
good
with
make
a
less
ambiguous
film
like
this
.
the
writing
be
good
from
rita
rudner
and
martin
bregman
,
with
lot
of
good
one-liner
,
and
even
some
really
bad
but
good
pun
-lrb-
to
mock
the
fact
that
andrew
life
in
l
.
a
.
,
peter
,
while
cut
some
log
,
ask
he
be
he
have
wood
in
l
.
a
.
,
and
andrew
say
,
''
no
,
but
we
have
hollywood
''
-
punishment
like
that
-rrb-
.
the
actor
,
as
in
most
speak
movie
,
be
better
than
they
material
,
though
,
with
some
stand-out
performance
to
the
six
friend
,
as
well
as
the
outsider
like
slattery
,
rudner
,
and
phyllida
law
as
the
old
housekeeper
of
the
peter
's
mansion
.
a
little
note
should
be
make
about
hugh
laurie
's
performance
,
as
he
look
like
he
take
some
massive
dose
of
prozac
before
do
this
-
i
mean
,
i
have
never
see
he
actually
act
this
dramatically
.
''
peter
's
friend
''
be
a
really
enjoyable
film
which
make
people
like
I
pine
for
some
sort
of
future
reunion
,
although
i
do
not
know
what
kind
i
'll
have
-lrb-
like
most
people
,
i
do
not
look
forward
to
my
high
school
reunion
-rrb-
.
because
of
the
way
these
friend
be
still
able
to
maintain
the
same
amount
of
care
they
have
for
one
another
and
after
such
a
long
period
of
seperation
,
i
just
look
forward
to
the
day
when
i
can
have
friend
like
that
.
