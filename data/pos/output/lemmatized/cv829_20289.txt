albert
brook
save
the
day
,
just
in
the
nick
of
time
.
with
a
very
poor
summer
for
movie
,
brook
be
just
what
audience
be
look
for
to
cheer
they
up
,
and
do
so
in
a
positive
way
.
while
this
may
not
be
he
finest
work
,
''
the
muse
''
still
shake
up
some
delightful
humor
.
in
albert
brook
's
latest
comedy
,
he
tell
a
story
of
a
troubled
screenwriter
-lrb-
brook
-rrb-
who
be
lose
he
edge
,
as
he
business
partner
say
.
in
desperation
,
he
go
to
see
he
friend
jack
-lrb-
jeff
bridge
-rrb-
,
who
have
be
a
very
successful
screenwriter
in
the
past
.
he
ask
jack
for
some
help
,
and
recieve
word
of
a
real
life
muse
,
that
have
help
he
and
many
other
director
throughout
they
career
.
so
brook
seek
the
muse
name
sarah
-lrb-
sharon
stone
-rrb-
,
and
be
sucker
into
buy
she
expensive
,
food
etc
.
as
a
sort
of
payment
.
the
real
punch
line
however
,
do
not
come
until
the
end
.
it
really
make
you
wonder
,
how
screenwriter
really
get
they
idea
,
could
it
simply
be
from
a
friend
or
a
bum
in
the
street
?
the
idea
itself
be
provoke
and
brook
do
it
in
a
hilarious
manner
.
speaking
of
brook
,
he
be
absolutely
hysterical
as
a
screenwriter
.
every
time
he
grace
the
screen
,
i
can
not
help
but
start
laugh
.
albert
have
a
very
unique
sense
of
humor
that
make
he
a
very
likeable
character
.
the
real
problem
with
the
film
lie
with
sharon
stone
.
she
be
not
likeable
at
all
.
brook
have
the
right
idea
with
she
occupation
,
but
she
never
pull
through
.
in
a
way
,
she
drain
energy
from
the
once
funny
atmosphere
and
leave
it
bleak
.
luckily
brook
could
clean
up
the
mess
,
and
cover
for
stone
's
mishap
.
it
be
a
shame
that
the
film
go
slightly
downhill
after
she
appearance
,
because
''
the
muse
''
have
the
potential
to
a
be
a
very
authentic
comedy
.
on
a
brighter
note
,
andie
macdowell
be
also
charming
as
brook
's
wife
.
she
be
always
a
nice
addition
as
a
support
actress
,
because
she
have
that
charisma
that
seem
to
complete
the
atmosphere
to
any
film
she
be
in
.
the
funniest
moment
in
''
the
muse
''
in
my
opinion
be
the
cameo
by
jame
cameron
and
martin
scorsese
.
i
mean
imagine
,
brook
see
these
big
name
director
in
he
back
yard
seek
sharon
stone
for
advice
,
like
it
be
something
out
of
the
ordinary
.
it
be
just
plain
hilarious
.
it
just
add
to
the
satire
joke
,
of
how
director
get
idea
.
brilliant
move
by
brook
.
as
i
mention
before
,
the
film
be
a
satire
much
like
it
be
proceeder
bowfinger
,
which
come
out
a
few
week
before
.
unlike
bowfinger
,
this
be
not
a
mean
spirited
film
that
be
desperate
for
joke
,
it
be
rather
a
witty
and
humorous
look
at
hollywood
.
''
bowfinger
''
have
it
be
moment
,
but
have
quite
a
few
problem
that
be
never
work
out
,
but
''
the
muse
''
still
manage
to
keep
the
laugh
despite
a
bit
of
a
detour
.
by
the
end
of
the
film
,
you
be
glad
to
see
a
good
hearty
comedy
come
out
of
it
.
for
once
i
be
not
fully
disappointed
,
because
the
film
do
not
slow
down
,
it
keep
move
,
even
with
some
flaw
.
thumb
up
to
brook
for
he
brave
effort
.
i
think
he
'll
still
manage
to
keep
he
edge
around
well
into
the
future
.
