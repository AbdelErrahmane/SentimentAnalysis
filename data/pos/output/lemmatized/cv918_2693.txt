a
lot
to
tell
and
little
to
say
.
this
story
of
the
legendary
lawman
run
three
hour
and
nine
minute
and
that
be
too
long
for
this
epic-wannabe
that
play
more
like
a
tv
mini-series
than
a
movie
.
the
story
open
on
the
earp
family
farm

with
young
wyatt

return
home
to
marry

and
,
after
a
spell
,
begin
he
career
in

wyatt

hand
at
everything
from
hunting
buffalo
to

.
wyatt
earp
be
very
appealing
in
place
--
such
as
cast

costume
,
and
cinematography
--
but
a
overstate
story
and
overpowered

deaden
most

the
emotional
impact

somber
be
fine
--
just
ask

a
little
bit
of

go
a
long
way
and
the
life

of

from
