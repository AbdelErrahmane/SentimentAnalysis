one
of
the
more
unusual
and
suggestively
violent
film
ever
make
,
''
se7en
''
be
just
a
few
step
away
from
brilliance
.
however
,
those
few
step
away
be
only
a
few
step
from
a
level
of
evil
and
depravity
that
few
people
want
to
discuss
.
the
film
receive
mixed
review
upon
release
,
but
there
be
a
underlying
sinister
appeal
and
intrigue
to
this
that
many
critic
perhaps
do
not
notice
.
at
time
it
get
preachy
about
the
horror
it
seem
to
be
criticize
,
but
the
script
and
the
ultimate
pay-off
be
excellent
.
the
shocking
conclusion
be
just
as
unpredictable
as
the
ending
of
most
film
be
predictable
.
this
piece
of
work
be
100
%
intensity
.
it
be
uncomfortable
to
watch
,
yet
compelling
.

i
want
not
to
look

yet
i
can

''
the
story
creep
along
slowly
and
deliberately
,
craft
by
visionary
director
david
fincher
.
he
have
experience
in
tantalize
he
audience
with
information
and
vision
,
but
not
give
away
too
much
too
soon
.
this
be
the
guy
who
direct
the
ominous
''
alien
3
''
.
''
se7en
''
be
even
more
ominous
because
the
threat
be
real
.
it
be
human
and
,
while
the
script
take
some
artistic
licence
,
the
way
in
which
the
diabolical
killer
work
here
be
actually
realistic
.
that
be
,
if
a
human
being
could
be
so
intelligent
,
patient
,
wealthy
,
and
disillusioned
.
after
the
most
bizarre
opening
credit
i
have
ever
see
-lrb-
refreshingly
different
in
editing
style
and
musical
accompaniment
-rrb-
,
the
initial
character
development
take
place
.
morgan
freeman
star
as
detective
william
somerset
,
a
knowledgeable
veteran
who
be
ready
to
give
up
on
he
job
and
the
sickness
of
society
.
brad
pitt
co-star
as
detective
david
mill
,
the
young
hotshot
who
be
brand
new
to
this
unnamed
city
and
full
of
fury
to
catch
the
bad
guy
.
these
two
fine
actor
give
the
film
its
human
quality
-lrb-
along
with
the
appealing
gwyneth
paltrow
,
who
play
tracy
,
mill
'
wife
-rrb-
.
however
,
none
of
they
stand
out
above
the
material
.
no
disrespect
intend
,
but
two
other
actor
could
have
play
these
part
and
the
film
probably
would
have
be
about
the
same
.
a
ironic
note
be
that
somerset
have
only
a
week
-lrb-
or
7
,
that
be
seven
,
day
-rrb-
leave
on
the
force
to
train
he
young
protege
.
the
title
of
the
picture
also
refer
to
the
7
deadly
sin
,
as
chronicle
by
john
milton
in
''
paradise
lose
''
--
gluttony
,
greed
,
sloth
,
lust
,
pride
,
envy
,
&
wrath
.
incidentally
,
i
write
the
sin
in
order
of
how
each
victim
be
find
.
it
be
the
last
two
sin
that
be
the
most
intriguing
and
shocking
,
but
i
will
not
give
that
away
.
as
i
say
,
this
have
a
great
ending
and
no
one
should
spoil
it
.
anyway
,
the
brilliant
killer
set
out
to
make
a
statement
to
the
world
that
these
sin
will
no
longer
be
tolerate
and
he
make
the
''
sinner
''
suffer
for
it
.
the
two
partner
stumble
over
the
corpse
of
a
grotesquely
obese
man
.
they
learn
that
he
be
murder
--
force
to
eat
himself
to
death
.
the
killer
leave
small
clue
at
this
and
other
murder
and
,
of
course
,
somerset
and
mill
be
smart
enough
to
stay
with
he
all
the
way
.
if
they
do
not
,
it
would
be
one
short
movie
!
the
deliberate
pace
allow
for
craftsmanship
of
detail
and
story
.
we
see
a
lot
of
blood
,
but
it
be
not
especially
violent
.
the
suggestion
of
what
happen
be
far
more
disgusting
than
anything
actually
show
--
like
most
of
the
violence
in
''
pulp
fiction
''
.
''
se7en
''
be
gory
,
graphic
,
and
disturbing
,
but
all
the
gore
be
post-death
.
still
,
if
you
tend
to
get
queasy
,
do
not
eat
food
during
this
film
.
kevin
spacey
play
john
doe
,
the
avenge
angel
who
claim
that
he
be
the
messenger
who
will
right
the
wrong
with
he
teaching
.
like
many
crazy
man
,
he
have
some
fine
idea
,
but
some
sick
way
of
express
himself
.
spacey
do
not
appear
until
the
final
30
minute
and
also
do
not
receive
billing
in
the
opening
credit
.
however
,
it
be
he
appearance
that
turn
this
film
upside
down
and
for
that
he
should
have
get
a
oscar
nomination
.
a
great
villain
manage
to
make
you
either
root
for
he
or
feel
compel
to
listen
to
he
rambling
regardless
of
whether
you
agree
with
he
or
not
.
this
character
be
so
well
write
that
it
be
hard
to
disagree
when
he
say
that
what
he
be
do
will
be
remember
by
everyone
.
no
serial
killer
have
ever
be
so
creative
.
''
se7en
''
be
blatantly
unsubtle
with
its
message
about
the
horror
of
the
world
and
it
be
often
a
little
too
depressing
.
what
it
lack
in
those
area
,
it
make
up
for
with
believable
dialogue
,
top-notch
screenwriting
,
unexpected
twist
,
and
realistic
character
.
the
technical
aspect
of
the
film
be
unobtrusive
.
fincher
use
lighting
,
music
,
and
editing
quite
well
,
but
he
story
be
always
the
thrust
of
the
film
.
fortunately
,
we
do
not
find
out
what
happen
to
mill
and
somerset
after
the
closing
credit
-lrb-
which
be
run
backwards
up
the
screen
!
-rrb-
.
it
be
better
to
imagine
what
path
they
will
follow
.
this
be
not
the
kind
of
film
you
turn
away
from
and
quickly
forget
.
it
be
get
a
sinister
message
and
john
doe
be
right
about
one
thing
--
the
evil
of
the
world
be
not
go
to
cure
themselves
.
''
se7en
''
raise
some
tough
question
and
it
be
intelligent
enough
to
allow
its
audience
to
answer
many
of
those
question
for
themselves
.
useless
trivia
