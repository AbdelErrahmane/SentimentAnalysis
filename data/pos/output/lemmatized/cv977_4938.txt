richard
gere
be
not
one
of
my
favorite
actor
.
however
,
i
like
courtroom
drama
,
and
this
film
look
good
enough
to
take
a
chance
on
.
i
be
not
disappoint
.
it
be
not
a
great
film
,
but
it
be
interesting
,
and
take
several
unexpected
turn
.
one
thing
:
what
be
with
the
title
?
not
only
be
it
extremely
forgettable
,
it
do
not
really
have
much
to
do
with
the
film
,
as
far
as
i
could
determine
.
in
the
long
run
,
it
will
probably
hurt
the
film
,
as
people
will
not
be
able
to
think
of
or
remember
it
.
martin
vail
-lrb-
richard
gere
-rrb-
be
a
grandiose
defense
attorney
.
he
love
the
money
and
the
fame
that
go
along
with
defend
-lrb-
successfully
-rrb-
rich
scum
,
such
as
mafia
man
and
drug-dealer
.
once
he
see
that
the
accuse
killer
of
a
prominent
chicago
archbishop
be
a
baby-faced
alter
boy
,
he
want
in
on
the
case
,
presumably
for
the
press
he
'll
get
.
we
soon
find
out
that
the
prosecutor
assign
be
a
former
lover
,
janet
venable
-lrb-
laura
linney
-rrb-
.
vail
himself
be
a
former
prosecutor
,
and
quit
because
of
tension
between
himself
and
the
district
attorney
,
play
very
well
by
john
mahoney
-lrb-
frasier
's
father
on
the
tv
series
-rrb-
.
there
be
a
underlying
theme
of
dichotomy
in
the
movie
:
people
have
public
face
,
and
private
face
.
we
see
this
in
the
murder
archbishop
,
in
the
accuse
,
and
,
most
strongly
,
defense
attorney
martin
vail
.
richard
gere
do
a
fairly
good
job
.
at
first
,
he
appear
to
be
a
money
-
and
attention-grabbing
lawyer
,
with
no
consideration
of
the
truth
.
but
we
see
another
side
,
as
he
become
a
seeker
of
justice
,
and
come
to
believe
in
he
client
.
alfre
woodard
,
as
the
judge
,
be
capable
,
though
somewhat
waste
in
a
standard
role
.
laura
linney
also
do
journeyman
work
;
nothing
spectacular
,
but
acceptable
.
she
relationship
with
vail
be
believable
;
they
verbal
fencing
add
to
the
film
.
the
actor
who
playe
vail
's
investigator
-lrb-
unfortunately
,
i
do
not
remember
he
name
-rrb-
be
quite
good
.
he
female
assistant
-lrb-
she
look
very
familiar
,
but
i
can
not
remember
where
i
have
see
she
-rrb-
be
also
capable
,
but
unspectacular
.
the
best
performance
in
the
film
be
by
edward
norton
.
he
be
excellent
,
as
the
timid
altar-boy
turn
allege
''
butcher
boy
of
st
.
mike
's
''
.
i
be
impress
by
the
depth
of
the
plot
;
there
be
red-herring
,
and
dead-end
,
that
in
a
lesser
film
would
lead
to
a
predictable
ending
.
i
like
the
plot
twist
the
film
take
,
and
most
of
the
support
character
,
thus
i
give
primal
fear
a
respectable
b
+
rating
.
