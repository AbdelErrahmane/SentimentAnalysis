for
any
groom
on
the
verge
of
propose
marriage
to
he
girlfriend
,
there
be
certain
rule
that
he
need
to
follow
.
firstly
,
fill
she
life
with
happiness
and
romance
during
the
courtship
.
secondly
,
buy
she
a
beautiful
ring
that
glitter
as
brightly
as
she
eye
.
thirdly
,
find
the
perfect
moment
and
location
to
propose
.
finally
,
the
groom-wannabe
should
probably
get
she
parent
's
blessing
.
of
these
four
,
the
last
one
can
be
a
nightmare
.
meet
parent
be
a
rite
of
passage
,
fraught
with
unexpected
question
,
bout
of
nervousness
,
the
reality
of
be
dislike
,
and
the
inability
to
make
a
positive
impression
.
if
you
be
lucky
,
thing
will
go
smoothly
.
but
,
if
you
be
greg
focker
-lrb-
ben
stiller
-rrb-
,
everything
will
go
wrong
.
and
with
a
name
like
that
,
how
could
it
not
?
when
greg
first
meet
he
fianc
?
e
's
father
,
jack
byrne
-lrb-
the
grimace
robert
deniro
-rrb-
,
greg
immediately
feel
overwhelmed
and
be
put
on
the
defensive
.
when
he
tell
jack
that
he
be
a
male
nurse
,
the
incorrigible
dad
shoot
back
,
''
not
many
man
in
you
profession
,
huh
,
greg
?
''
it
be
definitely
not
a
good
start
.
but
greg
be
determine
to
win
he
over
,
and
it
be
this
desire
that
fuel
the
movie
.
he
first
take
small
step
such
as
agree
to
say
grace
before
dinner
.
it
do
not
matter
that
he
be
jewish
.
if
daddy
byrne
ask
he
to
say
grace
,
then
that
be
what
he
be
go
to
gamely
do
.
''
oh
god
...
you
be
such
a
good
god
''
,
he
moon
.
he
discomfort
at
try
to
force
out
a
simple
prayer
will
make
you
chuckle
,
but
when
jack
give
he
the
''
deniro
squint
''
-lrb-
that
familiar
,
unsettling
gaze
that
give
deniro
that
aura
of
invincibility
-rrb-
,
it
be
pretty
hard
not
to
grin
.
thing
get
progressively
worse
for
greg
.
and
that
be
too
bad
because
he
be
a
genuinely
likable
guy
with
a
romantic
heart
.
eventually
,
he
begin
to
try
so
hard
that
he
start
to
mess
everything
up
,
commit
a
host
of
gaffe
that
embarrass
,
humiliate
or
injure
other
people
.
it
be
a
never-ending
ordeal
of
misstep
,
miscue
,
and
mistake
.
he
buy
some
champagne
,
but
uncork
the
bottle
lead
to
disastrous
circumstance
.
he
try
to
find
jack
's
miss
cat
.
but
he
method
of
solve
the
problem
lead
only
to
more
trouble
.
and
there
be
several
other
episode
,
each
one
trump
the
next
in
outrageousness
.
the
more
we
well-meaning
beau
screw
up
,
the
more
the
audience
groan
in
sympathy
.
we
like
greg
.
and
,
we
like
this
movie
.
''
meet
the
parent
''
be
a
farcical
comedy
that
certainly
have
its
moment
.
just
sit
back
and
watch
greg
get
into
trouble
.
no
matter
what
the
situation
,
whether
its
play
a
harmless
game
of
water
volleyball
or
sneak
a
smoke
on
the
roof
of
the
house
,
thing
will
horribly
go
wrong
.
we
laugh
at
greg
's
expense
,
but
love
often
make
a
person
do
dumb
thing
,
and
ben
stiller
have
the
knack
of
play
the
romantic
fool
.
deniro
be
also
affable
,
tough
on
the
outside
yet
sentimental
on
the
inside
.
they
tug-of-war
be
often
funny
,
the
slapstick
be
elaborate
,
and
there
be
several
topical
throwaway
gag
-lrb-
mostly
target
at
the
airline
industry
-rrb-
to
make
this
film
a
amusing
yet
smart
lampoon
about
future
in-law
from
hell
.
