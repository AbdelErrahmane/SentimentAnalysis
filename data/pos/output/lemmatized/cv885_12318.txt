when
jim
henson
pass
away
,
he
leave
behind
diverse
legion
of
fan
and
a
company
whose
ultimate
success
,
it
now
seem
,
hinge
on
he
input
.
jim
henson
production
and
the
creature
shop
be
still
thrive
financially
,
but
as
the
last
two
muppet
film
-lrb-
or
that
silly
computer-generated
monkey
from
lose
in
space
-rrb-
demonstrate
,
the
thrill
and
genius
be
go
.
i
be
not
sure
the
dark
crystal
,
make
today
,
would
generate
from
a
audience
of
kid
five
to
fifty
the
same
awe-filled
response
.
a
all-powerful
crystal
have
crack
,
cause
the
leader
of
the
green
world
to
split
apart
into
two
being
:
the
big
,
gentle
mystic
,
and
the
vulture-like
skeksis
.
the
mystic
send
jen
,
a
naive
gelfling
boy
,
on
a
mission
to
find
the
shard
that
crack
away
,
which
must
be
reinsert
into
the
crystal
before
the
skeksis
become
eternal
ruler
,
before
the
great
''
conjunction
''
of
three
sun
.
along
the
way
,
jen
encounter
and
team
up
with
the
only
other
gelfle
alive
,
the
rebecca
demornay-like
kira
,
a
ogre-witch
name
aughra
,
who
remove
she
eye
to
look
at
thing
,
and
a
spastic-but-friendly
,
tumbleweed-like
animal
name
fizzgig
.
much
of
the
beauty
in
the
dark
crystal
,
which
be
a
simple
tale
-lrb-
though
it
do
not
condescend
to
any
viewer
-rrb-
,
lie
in
its
art
direction
and
creature
design
.
the
puppeteering
be
phenomenal
--
observe
the
scene
in
which
jen
play
he
flute
,
or
the
landwalker
chase
--
but
i
must
stress
that
any
thought
of
string
and
hand
and
remote
control
all
but
vanish
in
the
opening
moment
of
the
picture
,
a
delicately-narrated
-lrb-
by
john
baddeley
-rrb-
,
absorb
prologue
.
the
voice
work
in
the
film
,
by
muppet
regular
and
irregular
,
be
tone-perfect
.
as
well
,
trevor
jone
'
score
should
not
be
discount
:
it
contribute
to
the
film
almost
as
a
unseen
character
.
i
suppose
,
due
to
the
complexity
involve
in
execute
a
movie
of
this
nature
,
that
it
could
not
be
help
,
but
i
wish
the
film
be
longer
.
jen
and
kira
have
wonderful
...
well
,
chemistry
,
and
more
scene
of
they
quietly
converse
would
have
be
appreciate
.
the
dark
crystal
have
a
very
small
cult
follow
.
the
weaker
labyrinth
be
probably
better-known
,
which
be
upset
.
a
friend
of
mine
relate
a
story
to
I
that
henson
be
pressure
into
plant
human
among
labyrinth
's
creature
due
to
the
financial
failure
of
people-less
the
dark
crystal
.
that
film
never
quite
find
its
footing
;
it
play
like
a
acid-trip
episode
of
''
the
muppet
show
''
with
david
bowie
as
guest-host
,
borrow
from
tolkien
and
pandering
to
tolkien
's
fan-base
.
-lrb-
i
suppose
i
just
make
labyrinth
sound
appetizing
to
a
certain
sector
of
the
public
.
-rrb-
the
dark
crystal
deserve
-lrb-
and
still
deserve
-rrb-
a
bigger
audience
.
it
be
the
best
kind
of
child
's
entertainment
:
elegant
,
fantastical
,
and
courageously
un-hip
.
brian
henson
,
fortunate
son
,
keep
look
back
at
this
,
you
father
's
masterpiece
.
