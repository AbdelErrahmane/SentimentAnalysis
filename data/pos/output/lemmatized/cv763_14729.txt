you
friend
and
neighbor
be
a
rather
bizarre
film
about
6
people
,
who
hop
in
and
out
of
bed
with
each
other
.
write
and
direct
by
neil
labute
,
who
be
first
film
,
''
in
the
company
of
man
''
be
simply
marvelous
,
disappoint
a
bit
here
with
this
one
.
the
story
involve
two
couple
-lrb-
ben
stiller
&
catherine
keener
and
aaron
eckhart
&
amy
brenneman
-rrb-
,
a
artist
assistant
-lrb-
nastassja
kinskus
-rrb-
,
and
a
egotistical
woman
abuser
-lrb-
jason
patric
-rrb-
.
the
character
's
name
be
not
apparent
and
be
not
mention
in
the
entire
movie
.
each
of
the
character
have
they
own
sexual
style
and
they
do
not
seem
to
''
merge
''
together
well
.
so
the
group
experiment
behind
they
respective
partner
back
.
there
be
some
hysterical
scene
,
one
involve
jason
patric
,
aaron
eckhart
,
and
ben
stiller
's
character
.
they
be
all
in
a
sauna
,
talk
about
they
best
''
lay
''
,
when
jason
patric
's
character
make
a
surprising
confession
.
the
whole
scene
be
hilarious
and
exceptionally
well
write
and
act
.
the
enjoy
this
movie
,
although
it
seem
a
tad
lengthy
-lrb-
even
though
it
only
run
99
min
.
-rrb-
.
the
film
's
cast
be
exceptional
with
oscar
caliber
performance
by
catherine
keener
,
aaron
eckhart
,
and
jason
patric
.
i
would
not
recommend
this
film
,
to
people
who
be
offend
by
conversation
that
be
very
sexually
explicit
.
it
do
seem
to
offend
people
,
more
than
half
of
the
people
in
the
theater
leave
during
the
film
.
although
you
friend
and
neighbor
do
not
have
the
power
of
labute
's
earlier
film
it
still
manage
to
be
somewhat
entertaining
and
funny
,
while
maintain
a
melancholy
philosophy
on
human
relationship
.
