it
be
no
secret
in
the
motion
picture
industry
that
the
relationship
between
a
script
and
the
actor
involve
often
make
or
break
a
movie
at
the
box
office
.
a
poorly-written
script
can
be
best
by
a
superb
act
corps
,
and
a
well-written
piece
can
be
mangled
by
a
group
of
amateur
.
in
direct
he
latest
action-comedy
,
director
brett
ratner
-lrb-
money
talk
-rrb-
take
a
relatively
mediocre
piece
of
standup
comedy
and
turn
it
into
a
funny
as
all
get-out
buddy
cop
movie
.
in
addition
,
rush
hour
serve
as
a
first-class
example
of
direct
a
movie
with
conservative
attitude
-
a
feature
that
be
sure
to
draw
in
crowd
of
all
type
.
the
two
lead
name
share
equal
screen
time
here
,
mostly
because
they
spend
it
together
.
jackie
chan
,
in
he
first
completely
american
production
,
make
a
impressive
debut
by
mix
dialogue
with
martial
art
.
the
other
martial
art
flick
from
a
few
week
ago
,
knock
off
,
stand
no
chance
against
the
content
of
this
one
.
chan
manage
to
make
every
fight
scene
exude
grace
and
poise
,
and
there
be
no
doubt
that
a
large
percentage
of
video
sale
for
this
movie
will
come
from
viewer
who
could
not
believe
they

the
first

chri
tucker
,
on
the
opposite
side
,
relate
a
hilarious
comedic
approach
which
smoothe
out
the
rough
edge
to
chan
's
performance
.
he
work
perfectly
with
the
script
,
and
it
be
quite
likely
he
lend
scribe
jim
kouf
a
hand
with
some
of
he
line
.
almost
essential
to
the
action
genre
,
the
plot
be
nonexistent
.
we
be
quickly
introduce
to
detective
jame
carter
-lrb-
tucker
-rrb-
be
a
maverick
officer
for
the
lapd
.
cut
forward
to
another
scene
where
the
daughter
-lrb-
julium
hsu
-rrb-
of
the
american
chinese
consul
-lrb-
tzus
ma
-rrb-
be
kidnap
by
a
gang
of
swarthy
character
.
the
fbus
be
quick
to
the
rescue
,
but
the
consul
insist
that
one
of
he
man
,
detective
inspector
lee
-lrb-
chan
-rrb-
,
be
bring
on
the
case
to
help
.
the
fbus
resist
,
but
then
request
that
lapd
send
a
man
over
to
babysit
the
chinese
detective
.
it
be
here
that
carter
and
lee
hook
up
,
and
the
two
unwittingly
solve
the
case
while
the
fbus
rush
in

rattner
do
a
fine
job
of
go
the
extra
mile
to
get
he
movie
to
move
a
step
up
,
but
it
do
not
quite
reach
the
top
tier
of
action-comedy
like
last
year
's
grosse
pointe
blank
.
there
be
moment
where
the
plot
stray
too
far
off
the
straight
line
it
stick
almost
exclusively
to
,
and
if
not
for
the
comedic
interaction
between
tucker
and
chan
,
this
might
be
a
major
drawback
.
also
,
some
support
character
be
almost
entirely
along
for
the
ride
,
and
other
be
there
simply
to
look
menacing
.
however
,
none
give
a
standoffish
performance
and
they
mostly
mesh
into
the
background
.
almost
every
member
of
the
cast
display
some
reservation
at
one
point
or
another
-
whether
it
be
tucker
's
toned-down
routine
or
chan
's
tight
rein
on
he
action
sequence
-
and
that
contribute
greatly
to
this
be
a
watchable
movie
for
all
type
.
a
recommendable
visit
to
the
theater
,
indeed
.
