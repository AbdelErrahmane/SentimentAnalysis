kiss
each

and
utter
what
sound
like
''
rock

it

you

and
of
course
with
its
storyline
of
a
crazy
girl

in

who
turn

,
the
film
unapologetically
take
its
place
alongside
all
those
other
film
from
bonnie

but
if
most
of

we
have
hear
that

and
yet
in
no
other
tale
of
violent
couple
have
it
seem
so
solidly
demonstrate
...
or
so
strangely
poignant
.
for
this
be
a
story
of
real

in

accomplish
the
not-inconsiderable
feat

nearly

that

.
moustach
,
with
a
tough
paternal
look
and
yet
a
voice
and
eye
that
suggest
sadness
verge
on
exasperation
,
he
be
perfectly
cast
as
the
long-suffering
husband
.
-lrb-
it
be
another
of
john
mcnaughton
's
coup
of
casting-against-type
,
after
transform
robert
de
niro
into
nerd
and
bill
murray
into
gangster
in
mad
dog
and
glory
-rrb-
.
but
it
be
the
character
of
pam
who
command
centrestage
,
and
ashley
judd
rise
to
the
challenge
with
great
alternate
current
of
ferocity
and
tenderness
,
make
pam
into
a
fascinating
yet
often
infuriating
person
.
if
the
performance
fall
short
of
greatness
,
however
,
it
be
perhaps
because
the
role
of
the
mad
woman
have
be
do
so
often
before
it
be
virtually
a
staple
of
cinema
,
whether
it
be
in
betty
blue
,
tom
&
viv
or
georgium
.
as
in
those
movie
,
there
be
the
danger
that
the
performance
seem
mannered
,
a
collection
of
screwy
tic
and
tantrum
design
for
the
oscar
presentation
piece
.
judd
do
not
entirely
avoid
this
pitfall
,
but
pam
's
`
craziness
'
be
best
and
most
movingly
present
in
counterpoint
to
the
more
`
normal
'
chri
.
when
pam
react
to
she
father-in-law
's
death
by
show
up
at
the
funeral
in
rollerblade
and
blare
headphone
,
chri
'
face
be
the
picture
of
pained
restraint
.
of
course
,
it
be
the
question
of
what
be
`
normal
'
that
be
ask
in
normal
life
.
mcnaughton
constantly
offer
up
the
irony
of
the
aspiration
for
the
average
domestic
life
and
its
kinship
with
insanity
.
it
be
the
rational
chri
that
love
gun
-lrb-
''
shooting
be
about
precision
,
control
''
-rrb-
and
the
`
crazy
'

--
''

wryly
-rrb-

it
be
chri
'
methodical
mind
and
he
knowledge
of

that
allow

to
be
such
a
successful
bank
robber
-lrb-
he

a

sign
on
a

out
in
the
background
:
''

''
--
the
perfectly
respectable
consumption-crazy
american
dream
that
have
drive
pam
to
she
extravagant
purchase
,
and
both
of
they
into
desperate
situation
.
it
be
not
a
perfect
film
.
some
of
the
dialogue
be
a
touch
too
banal
-lrb-
perhaps
intentionally
?
-rrb-
.
the
use
of
the
punk
hardcore
soundtrack
in
pam
's
crazed
scene
come
rather
too
close
to
make
emotional
disturbance
seem
glamourous
and
sexy
a
image
which
only
detract
from
the
rest
of
the
film
.
indeed
,
as
in
mcnaughton
's
seminal
film
henry
:
portrait
of
a
serial
killer
,
it
be
the
avoidance
of
glamour
or
sensationalism
,
the
denial
of
some
of
the
standard
thrill
of
the
outlaw
film
genre
,
that
give
this
determinedly
unflashy
,
move
film
its
great
strength
.
mcnaughton
have
film
this
story
with
a
quiet
,
coolly
`
realistic
'
method
that
work
far
better
than
any
nbk
theatric
at
unsettling
the
viewer
.
the
suburb
,
with
they
mile
of
white-fenced
house
and
identikit
mall
,
take
on
a
sense
of
claustrophobic
blankness
.
in
its
very
different
way
,
this
make
for
as
haunting
a
backdrop
as
the
wide
open
space
in
terence
malick
's
badland
.
while
pam
share
the
yearning
of
malick
's
hero
to
escape
from
ordinary
life
,
chri
take
up
crime
precisely
so
that
they
can
lead
a
`
normal
life
'
-
they
little
house
on
the
suburb
be
finance
by
he
violent
robbery
.
but
these
be
dream
define
by
,
constrain
by
,
and
even
doom
by
,
the
limitation
of
the
`
normal
'
,
conventional
world
.
pam
's
final
scene
take
place
at
the
edge
of
the
suburb
,
where
wild
bush
grow
--
symbolically
the
frontier
,
the
outer
limit
of

society
,
but
also
quite
literally
the
end
of
the
road
,
where
there
be
nowhere
leave
to
go

to
the
final
tragic
denouement
