david
lynch
's
''
blue
velvet
''
begin
and
end
with
colorful
,
bright
shot
of
flower
and
happy
american
mow
they
lawn
in
a
seemingly
perfect
american
town
.
however
,
what
lie
inside
this
nominally
safe
atmosphere
be
a
''
strange
world
''
of
drug
dealer
,
sadist
,
and
murderer
.
the
opening
and
closing
shot
be
a
wonderful
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
gloomy
,
disturbing
film
.
they
show
not
to
make
assumption
from
first
glance
and
that
oddness
be
common
in
all
place
under
all
circumstance
.
odd
would
be
a
perfect
adjective
to
describe
this
film
,
its
character
,
its
direction
,
and
its
story
.
thankfully
,
the
obscurity
that
''
blue
velvet
''
rely
on
be
enough
to
make
this
film
enjoyable
.
since
its
element
be
so
originally
weird
,
you
never
know
what
will
happen
next
.
this
be
the
main
goal
of
a
movie
;
to
be
spontaneous
and
surprising
.
''
blue
velvet
''
miracuously
succeed
at
this
even
though
it
contain
mediocre
acting
.
lynch
create
such
a
hypnotic
world
that
it
be
hard
to
resist
he
style
of
story
tell
.
the
film
start
off
with
the
discovery
of
a
sever
ear
by
a
college
boy
-lrb-
kyle
maclachlan
-rrb-
.
from
this
point
maclachlan
find
himself
involve
with
a
lounge
singer
-lrb-
isabellum
rossellinium
-rrb-
who
have
lose
she
son
and
husband
to
a
kidnapping
.
the
plot
be
much
more
detailed
than
the
aforementioned
and
this
be
what
make
david
lynch
's
story
tell
so
amazing
.
maclachlan
become
involve
in
a
forbid
relationship
,
in
another
relationship
that
could
have
be
take
straight
out
of
a
high
school
flick
,
and
he
be
put
into
the
shoe
of
a
drug
dealer
who
have
some
wild
adventure
with
some
wild
friend
.
through
these
multiple
story
,
maclachlan
life
multiple
life
and
as
we
follow
maclachlan
,
we
be
introduce
to
a
variety
of
interesting
subplot
.
lynch
masterfully
build
these
subplot
but
he
do
not
piece
they
all
together
in
the
very
end
and
make
a
convenient
crowd
please
conclusion
.
instead
he
leave
some
ambiguity
and
force
those
curious
enough
to
get
the
real
meaning
to
watch
the
film
several
several
time
.
lynch
have
be
know
to
do
this
with
a
number
of
he
film
mean
he
may
be
too
esoteric
for
some
hope
to
get
a
hollywood
end
where
the
good
guy
get
the
girl
and
everything
turn
out
fine
.
however
,
for
fan
of
odd
difficult
indy
,
''
blue
velvet
''
could
be
just
what
they
be
look
for
.
it
be
very
hard
to
discuss
''
blue
velvet
''
without
discuss
the
performance
of
denni
hopper
's
sadistic
frank
.
most
of
the
other
actor
in
the
film
be
not
very
memorable
.
kyle
maclachlan
lack
one
important
aspect
for
he
role
,
a
personality
.
laura
dern
be
consistently
annoying
.
but
dennis
hopper
steal
every
scene
he
be
in
.
he
evil
character
be
just
plain
old
frightening
in
he
mannerism
from
he
obsession
to
velvet
to
he
incessant
breathing
from
a
gas
mask
.
frank
be
a
character
that
come
along
once
in
a
blue
moon
.
many
producer
know
this
and
have
inevitably
begin
to
typecast
hopper
as
the
bad
guy
.
just
like
he
villain
in
''
speed
''
,
hopper
be
over
the
edge
with
cursing
and
scream
every
chance
he
have
to
speak
.
this
harshness
be
exactly
what
frank
be
,
so
weird
and
twisted
that
it
be
hard
not
to
look
at
he
,
even
if
he
theaten
you
to
look
away
.
''
blue
velvet
''
have
character
and
story
you
will
never
see
in
a
movie
again
.
for
this
sole
reason
it
be
recommend
.
but
also
see
it
to
admire
lynch
's
obsession
to
avoid
the
norm
.
even
if
this
film
be
a
little
too
weird
for
you
,
it
be
hard
not
to
congratulate
a
guy
for
try
something
new
and
stick
to
it
.
