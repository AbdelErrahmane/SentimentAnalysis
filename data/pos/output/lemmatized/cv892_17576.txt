perhaps
the
most
dramatic
change
in
the
motion
picture
industry
in
this
decade
have
to
do
with
special
effect
.
there
be
no
question
that
action-adventure
and
science-fiction\/action
movie
be
now
judge
by
the
character
of
they
light
and
noise
.
whereas
classic
adventure
pic
of
the
last
twenty
year
,
such
as
raider
of
the
lose
ark
,
be
make
in
grand
traditional
fashion
;
contemporary
film
like
jurassic
park
be
multimillion-dollar
creation
of
computer
technology
.
the
latest
in
this
visually
awesome
series
of
movie
,
the
wachowskus
brother
'
the
matrix
,
be
a
testament
to
the
skilled
use
of
special
effect
and
its
ability
to
enhance
a
movie
's
story
.
unlike
many
sci-fi
movie
which
promote
themselves
as
effects-heavy
blockbuster
but
fail
to
deliver
on
that
promise
,
the
matrix
be
a
carefully
construct
special
effect
event
.
it
run
135
minute
in
length
and
employ
a
countless
number
of
computerized
trick
which
range
from
gimmick
to
grandiose
,
and
the
quality
of
the
effect
remain
constant
throughout
the
film
's
length
.
contrary
to
popular
trend
,
the
matrix
commit
itself
to
be
a
spectacle
of
light
and
sound
.
in
this
regard
,
the
movie
be
something
like
a
card
sharp
.
with
its
flashy
mass
strip
away
,
the
matrix
would
be
quite
shallow
and
untalented
.
the
script
be
characteristically
weak
,
and
the
dialogue
suffer
in
lieu
of
a
far
more
innovative
visual
approach
.
but
,
like
the
card
sharp
,
the
matrix
wow
its
audience
to
such
a
high
degree
that
actual
content
be
irrelevent
.
the
viewer
do
not
care
about
what
the
matrix
have
to
say
as
long
as
the
next
special
effect
sequence
be
right
around
the
corner
.
and
right
around
the
corner
they
usually
be
,
for
the
script
tell
a
fast-paced
,
albeit
frequently
revisit
story
.
as
the
movie
explain
,
the
world
as
we
know
it
be
nothing
but
a
elaborate
computer
program
construct
by
a
artificial
intelligence
for
the
purpose
of
placate
mankind
.

state
while

only
a
select
group
of
individual
know
of
the
''
real
''
world

and
a
particularly
ingenious
squad
of
these
rebel
be

by
ultra-cool

morpheus
and

,
believe
he
be
a
prophesied
individual
who
will
help
they
overthrow
the
matrix
and
return
peace
to
earth
.
the
cast
play
out
this
story
in
stylish
fashion
.
the
set
design
be
very
dynamic
,
run
the
gambit
between
cramped
and
dreary
to
bright
and
airy
.
the
costume
,
as
well
as
the
actor
who
wear
they
,
add
to
the
role
.
for
instance
,
the
manifest
antagonist
in
the
movie
,
a

the

the
casting
can
not
be
criticize
,
for
the
typically
stoic
reeve

not
require
to
say
much
and
laurence
fishburne
get
plenty

and
hugo

be
all
effectual
.
one
of
the
best
comparison
to
thw
matrix
be
last
year
's
science
fiction
masterpiece
dark
city
,
particularly
if
one
ponder
how
this
same
premise
would
have
work
from
a
different
approach
.
the
alex
proya
film
be
far
more
dark
and
introspective
,
require
a
bit
of
think
before
theme
become
clear
;
here
,
the
wachowskus
brother
have
manage
to
construct
a
thrill-ride
motion
picture
with
little
abandon
and
much
noise
.
the
better
picture
between
the
two
depend
on
the
viewer
,
but
the
key
to
the
success
of
the
matrix
be
that
the
noise
do
not
get
in
the
way
of
the
fun
.
