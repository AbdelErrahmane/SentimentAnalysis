as

star
of

,
he
offer
the
mass
plenty
of
good
reason
not
to
pursue
a
career
in
the

,
perhaps
finally
vent
the
frustration
-lrb-
`

-rrb-
that
lead
to
he
brief
retirement
from

martin
star
as
bobby
bowfinger
,
a
roger
corman-wannabe
on
the
cusp
of
fifty
and
desperate
for
some
success
as
a
producer
,
quality

call
''

''
about
alien
who
travel

slightly
fatter
than

bowfinger
latch
onto
the
idea
immediately
,
and
convince
he
troupe
of
actor

to
appear
in

ramsey
,
of
course
,
want
nothing
to
do
with
such
low-grade
material
,
so
bowfinger
,
on
the
think
that
action
star
need
to
run
,
not
speak
,
decide
to
photograph
the
superstar
surreptitiously

ask

,
all

shoot
the
outcome
from

great
distance
.
the
paranoid
ramsey
flee
the
scene
nearly
every
time
.
ramsey
be
a

of

,
a

in

they
fear
the
nervous
breakdown
of

client
and
rush
he
off
to
a
retreat
,
require
bowfinger
to
find
a
stand-in
.
murphy
will
probably
win
more
fan
as
jiff
,
ramsey
's
adorable
,
ignoramus
double
,
than
as
kit
,
but
it
be
he
portrayal
of
the
latter
that
take
courage
.
always
surround
by
a
entourage
,
suffer
from
a
racial
inferiority
complex
,
murphy
play
right
into
the
tabloid
image
of
himself
.
furthermore
,
consider
the
enemy

,
ramsey
be
ask
to
shout
inane
personal
affirmation
repeatedly
.
murphy
's
scene
with
stamp
be
exactly
what
i
imagine
of
a
john
travolta
''
clearing
.
''
not
that
murphy
be
entirely
responsible
for
this
schtick
;
bowfinger
be
steve
martin
's
invention
.
he
script
be
surprisingly
clever
as
satire
,
give
that
the
pseudo-religion
be
a
sit
duck
,
as
be
the
entire
lo
angele
film
industry
.
-lrb-
the
griffin
mill-type
take
quite
a
beating
,
in
the
form
of
robert
downey
jr
.
as
bigwig
jerry
renfro
.
-rrb-
martin
's
decision
to
tell
the
story
from
a
bottom
feeder
's
point
of
view
be
what
keep
it
fresh
and
innovative-never
have
we
see
on
screen
a
group
of
people
struggle
this
hard
to
complete
a
motion
picture
.
as
expect
,
there
be
laugh
only
to
be
have
insider
or
buff
,
such
as
martin
's
crew
of
mexican
border-jumper
,
who
gain
unexpected
appreciation
for
the
classic
from
reading
''
cahier
du
cinema
,
''
or
martin
's
nonsensical
explanation
to
dave
,
he
loyal
cinematographer
-lrb-
jamie
kennedy
-rrb-
,
that
every
movie
,
in
the
end
,
have
a
budget
of
two-thousand
dollar
-lrb-
!
-rrb-
.
most
of
bowfinger
be
universally
funny
,
however
;
i
defy
any
viewer
to
keep
a
straight
face
when
christine
baranskus
,
one
of
we
brightest
comedienne
,
be
on
screen
.
bowfinger
's
main
flaw
be
a
plot
twist
that
have
a
insubstantial
aftermath
.
we
be
also
ask
to
believe
that
a
few
simple
close-up
of
kit
ramsey
would
redeem
''
chubby
rain
,
''
z-grade
entertainment
that
would
make
ed
wood
blush
.
-lrb-
this
aspect
of
bowfinger
have
much
in
common
with
the
ludicrous
oscar
sequence
in
oz
's
last
directorial
effort
,
the
poorly
conceive
in
&
out
.
-rrb-
these
be
significant
enough
weakness
that
they
distract
from
my
enjoyment
of
the
piece
.
as
i
mention
at
the
start
of
this
review
,
bowfinger
offer
solid
reason
not
to
do
what
heather
graham
's
character
daisy
do
:
hop
a
bus
to
hollywood
in
search
of
stardom
.
that
say
,
it
offer
one
fantastic
reason
to
get
on
that
bus
:
the
sense
of
community
between
filmmaker
who
gel
be
awesome
.
martin
get
sentimental
by
story
's
end
as
he
do
in
l
.
a
.
story
,
and
how
could
he
not
?
for
those
who
can
hack
it
,
the
movie
might
be
the
greatest
business
in
the
world
.
