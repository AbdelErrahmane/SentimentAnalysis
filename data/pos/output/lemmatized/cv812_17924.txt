-rrb-
do
you
realize
that
every
time
you
encounter
a
new
person
you
have
just
become
part
of
a
story
?
everyone
have
they
own
life
story
,
both
past
and
present
,
and
every
time
two
or
more
interact
,
they
become
part
of
each
other
'
story
-lrb-
not
necessarily
a
important
or
even
significant
part
,
but
a
part
nevertheless
-rrb-
.
that
seem
to
be
the
basic
theory
behind
`
go
,
'
where
several
character
'
chance
encounter
all
effect
each
other
in
extreme
way
.
in
order
to
test
this
theory
screenwriter
john
August
and
director
doug
liman
assemble
a
cast
of
character
that
would
not
usually
be
the
type
to
have
a
entire
film
revolve
around
they
,
such
as
a
teenage
supermarket
cashier
,
a
bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain
dealer
and
two
struggle
soap
opera
actor
.
these
type
of
character
might
not
sound
all
that
original
,
but
consider
that
they
will
all
be
somehow
effect
by
a
strip
club
bouncer
and
he
psychotic
father
,
a
mid-level
drug
dealer
,
a
narc
obsess
with
multi-level-marketing
,
horny
wedding
guest
,
a
zen
lovemaker
,
two
shrimp-scarfer
and
a
cute
normal
teenage
girl
to
round
thing
out
.
how
they
will
all
come
together
be
the
process
the
film
deal
with
.
i
would
imagine
the
concept
to
the
film
start
out
as
the
creator
'
testing
themselves
to
see
if
they
could
actually
pull
it
off
and
the
outcome
be
a
terrific
achievement
in
filmmaking
and
the
craft
of
fiction
in
general
.
the
film
start
out
as
anything
else
,
with
little
indication
of
what
be
to
come
.
we
meet
ronna
-lrb-
polley
-rrb-
,
a
depressed
lo
angele
checkout
girl
who
do
not
seem
to
have
much
desire
to
do
anything
except
work
just
to
pay
she
rent
.
she
be
not
very
charming
,
especially
to
she
customer
,
but
this
be
play
mostly
for
laugh
rather
than
characterization
and
it
work
.
maybe
this
be
because
she
be
not
a
very
afeminite
character
,
but
she
be
far
from
masculine
-
a
creative
character
indeed
.
thing
start
to
progress
when
ronna
reluctantly
agree
to
take
the
hour
of
the
goofy
,
hyperactive
,
yet
likable
simon
-lrb-
askew
-rrb-
,
a
english
teen
into
vice
for
the
sake
of
the
experience
.
this
agreement
start
a
three-pronged
storyline
as
it
allow
simon
to
go
to
las
vegas
for
the
weekend
with
he
friend
and
in
turn
drag
ronna
and
she
friend
into
buying
and
sell
a
experimental
drug
.
the
process
of
which
will
not
only
bring
ronna
close
to
be
arrest
but
also
to
death
.
nearly
the
same
can
be
say
for
two
other
character
,
zack
-lrb-
mohr
-rrb-
and
adam
-lrb-
wolf
-rrb-
,
who
we
do
not
think
much
of
when
they
first
appear
as
support
character
,
but
later
will
become
major
player
to
the
film
's
makeup
-
another
process
use
by
the
filmmaker
to
elaborate
on
the
theory
of
how
significant
insignificant
interaction
might
be
.
once
the
pace
be
pick
up
the
film
really
begin
to
show
its
mettle
.
when
the
title
screen
`
ronna
'
be
flash
shortly
after
the
aforementioned
turning
point
scene
,
it
be
clear
this
film
be
not
go
to
employ
the
standard
linear
method
of
storytelling
.
consider
how
good
it
be
up
until
that
point
,
it
be
a
long
overdue
change
of
pace
need
in
movie
today
.
and
so
the
film
begin
to
take
shape
,
first
by
follow
ronna
and
she
friend
on
a
one-night
adventure
that
begin
with
a
drug
deal
instigate
by
zack
and
adam
-lrb-
who
be
actually
look
for
simon
-rrb-
,
which
do
not
exactly
go
as
plan
,
but
that
be
what
keep
it
all
so
interesting
.
the
second
storyline
start
at
the
same
moment
as
ronna
's
story
,
but
this
time
the
camera
choose
to
follow
simon
instead
.
simon
and
he
three
friend
head
to
?
vega
for
a
night
on
the
town
and
in
the
process
experience
thing
they
never
would
have
imagine
.
the
third
arc
,
about
zack
and
adam
,
again
overlap
with
ronna
's
story
tell
much
of
the
same
story
but
from
a
completely
different
angle
.
we
be
show
thing
we
never
would
have
expect
be
go
on
while
follow
ronna
.
and
many
of
the
event
that
do
happen
to
ronna
because
of
zack
and
adam
be
not
even
they
fault
-
they
just
happen
to
be
where
they
be
when
they
be
.
i
would
really
like
to
dissect
each
of
the
three
storyline
and
especially
how
the
film
wrap
up
in
the
end
,
but
that
would
take
up
too
much
time
and
space
and
spoil
everything
for
those
who
have
not
see
the
film
.
perhaps
the
greatest
element
to
the
film
be
its
constant
surprise
and
unpredictability
,
and
not
due
to
plot
twist
or
a
confusing
screenplay
,
just
through
great
filmmaking
.
still
,
i
can
list
and
analyze
nearly
everything
the
film
do
so
well
:
?
direction
:
try
to
piece
together
such
a
complex
story
be
no
easy
task
and
for
a
rookie
filmmaker
such
as
liman
,
it
be
a
great
accomplishment
.
he
do
not
just
depict
a
story
,
he
wrap
we
up
in
it
all
,
pull
we
into
the
fray
so
that
we
experience
every
high
and
low
.
?
screenplay
:
besides
be
chisel
with
detail
and
creative
in
general
,
it
be
clear
the
script
have
be
inspire
by
many
source
,
with
both
obvious
and
subtle
reference
,
yet
it
never
scream
`
rip-off
.
'
?
tone\/mood
:
where
other
hollywood
film
have
fail
to
bring
the
charm
of
the
independent
to
the
mainstream
,
this
one
be
able
to
create
its
own
sense
of
the
macabre
.
it
be
not
overly-dark
or
twisted
and
the
comedy
be
not
so
satirical
for
it
to
be
consider
a
black
comedy
,
more
like
`
macabre
light
.
'
?
cinematography\/art
direction
:
able
to
photograph
both
the
intense
and
the
lighthearted
in
the
same
manner
.
?
characterization
:
for
nearly
every
character
introduce
,
no
matter
what
role
they
play
in
the
big
picture
,
we
be
able
to
get
a
sense
of
who
they
be
,
what
they
be
think
and
how
they
come
to
be
in
they
situation
.
even
when
they
action
be
surprising
,
it
never
seem
very
out
of
synch
.
?
performance
:
every
actor
nail
they
role
-lrb-
see
above
-rrb-
.
?
theme\/theory
:
the
film
do
not
seem
to
be
concern
with
convey
any
kind
of
political
or
social
message
,
instead
,
it
be
more
of
a
philosophical
experiment
.
in
fact
,
it
might
not
have
mean
to
do
that
intentionally
,
but
there
definitely
be
something
existential
to
it
all
.
...
and
to
think
that
`
go
'
be
just
a
big
comedy
and
adventure
!
