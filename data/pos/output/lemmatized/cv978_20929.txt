prepostrous

also
one
of

most
enjoyable

it
be
a
uncompromisingly
brutal
,
cheerfully
anarchic

hyperactive
actioner

never

it
have
be
brand
as
the
female
version

that

probably
a
correct
assessment

have

double
jeopardy
be
base
on
a
assumption
that
be
legally
false
.
the
law
state
that
nobody
can
be
convict
twice
for
the
same
crime
assume
that
it
be
the
same
crime
:
same
time
,
same
place
,
same
circumstance
.
it
be
not
like
it
matter
.
this
be
a
rollickingly
good
thriller
;
intense
,
exciting
,
fast
and
furious
.
it
be
silly
alright
,
but
this
be
the
kind
of
film
you
just
do
not
question
.
in
some
film
,
plausibility
be
everything
.
double
jeopardy
,
however
,
be
not
concern
with
make
sense
:
its
sole
purpose
be
to
entertain
,
and
it
do
.
judd
help
the
film
tremendously
in
a
difficult
role
.
this
be
she
breakout
box-office
performance
,
and
she
be
terrific
.
she
bring
some
emotion
to
what
could
have
be
a
one-dimensional
role
,
give
the
movie
a
little
soul
to
go
along
with
its
effective
chase
scene
and
action
set
piece
.
tommy
lee
jone
basically
just
reprise
the
role
for
which
he
win
a
oscar
in
the
fugitive
,
but
the
movie
make
good
use
of
he
stone-faced
wit
.
thankfully
,
too
,
double
jeopardy
refrain
from
develop
a
romance
between
libby
and
travi
;
a
subplot
which
doubtlessly
would
have
interfere
with
the
film
's
story
.
this
be
one
of
those
movie
where
cop
be
the
bad
guy
,
and
i
take
a
sort
of
sick
pleasure
in
that
.
the
sheer
anarchy
of
the
proceedings
be
nothing
short
of
wonderful
,
as
ashley
judd
kick
the
crap
out
of
every
authority
figure
in
the
book
.
after
all
the
idealistic
hollywood
feature
feature
hero
cop
,
deft
fbus
agent
and
the
virtue
of
the
american
legal
system
,
it
be
great
to
see
a
movie
that
do
not
so
much
demonstrate
they
fallacy
as
it
delight
in
they
failure
.
double
jeopardy
be
really
good
,
but
it
be
not
the
kind
of
good
that
be
remembered
or
recognize
with
award
.
it
be
one
of
those
movie
better
view
with
the
brain
turn
off
,
otherwise
,
you
brain
will
be
busy
ruin
you
experience
.
this
be
a
thriller
that
be
not
concern
with
be
smart
or
plausible
.
instead
it
divert
all
attention
to
the
action
,
which
,
this
year
,
be
second
to
none
.
