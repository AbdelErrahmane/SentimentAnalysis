and
social

appear
throughout

despite

proud
unequivocal
politics
,
one
of
the
most
impressive
feature
of
''

be
the
subtle
way
in
which
the

consider
the
difficulty
inherent
in

philosophy
of

and
black
symbolism

it
be
clear
that
the

in

fair
enough
,
but
this
homeland
be
a
specific
nation
curse
with
a
less
than
inspiring
reality
.
it
be
the
newly
found
zaire
and
it
be
rule
by
president

,
a
brutal
dictator

while

respects
mobutu

ability
to
forge
a

insight

lose
on
most
of

commentator

george

recall
that
he
always
feel
he
be
in
the
congo
,
rather
than
the
newly
christen

.
with
admirable
restraint
,
gast
quietly
suggest
that
for
many
the
grandeur
of
myth
and
history
all
but
obscure
the
reality
of
zaire
'
s
squalid
ruling
elite
.
mobutu
be
not
the
only
dubious
character
to
benefit
from
the
heady
symbolism
of

believe
he
have
get
a
raw
deal

he

all
be
leave
undifferentiated
,
unconsidered

in
this
optimistic
celebration
of

unity
.
little
wonder
that
the
people
of
zaire
be
shock
to
find
that
alus
's
opponent
be
not
white
.
admittedly
,
these
issue
be
only
hint
at
,
rather
than
substantially
explore
.
the
audience
must
consider
the
significance
of
these
issue
themselves
,
in
they
own
time
.
there
be
just
too
much
to
cover
,
too
much
that
be
truly
worthy
of
celebration
,
for
a
protracted
political
analysis
to
be
justified
.
the
excitement

for
instance

and
of
course
there
be
always

to
consider
,
as

and
hilariously

ham
it
up
in

of
the

,

and
utter
one
inspired
rhyme
after
another
-
''
we
gonna
get
it
on
coz
we
do
not
get
along
!
''
.
doubtlessly
,
consider
the
multi-faceted
nature
of
the
extravaganza
they
choose
to
cover
,
the
maker
of
''
when
we

numerous
difficulty
in

and
what
