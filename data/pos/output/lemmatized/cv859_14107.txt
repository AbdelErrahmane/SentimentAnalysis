last
half-hour
,
with
a
confrontation
and
eventual
ending
.
the
movie
be
visually
breathtaking
.
the
battle
scene
be
exquisitely
do
,
and
the
score
be
brilliant
,
set
a
murky
mood
of
darkness
that
be
first-rate
.
the
collage
of
disturbing
image
that
coppola
present
be
at
time
both
astonishing
and
sickening
.
the
vast
amount
of
detail

be
stunning
,
and
there
be
many
episode
that
be
deeply
powerful
which
resonate
through
the
entire

the
journey
to
kurtz
'
camp
be
quite
a
ride
,
with
psychosis
setting
in
on
almost
every
character

interesting
one
be

,
the
lt
.
col
.
who
care
more
about
the
surf
than
about
the
mission
.
it
be
at
time
revolting
,
psychotic
,
and
incredible
,
and
it
be
one
hell
of
a
movie
.
the
scene
be
bold
,
inventive
,
and
powerful
,
and
the
acting
be
stunning
,
especially
be
sheen
,
duvall
,
and
fishburne
.
the
narration
be
exquisite
,
as
be
the
mystery
of
kurtz
.
coppolum
set
about
a
hallucinatory
ride
through
vietnam
,
kind
of
like
''
save
private
ryan
''
on
lsd
.
the
film
be
jarring
in
its
implication
,
and
psychotic
in
its
execution
.
the
problem
come
when
the
film
slow
down
.
one
of
the
major
scene
in
the
film
,
where
the
boat
arrive
at
the
final
army
checkpoint
before
they
start
they
search
for
kurtz
,
be
a
colossal
mess
.
the
dialogue
be
confuse
,
the
lighting
be
atrocious
,
and
the
scene
drag
on
for
10
terrible
minute
of
film
.
the
true
problem
happen
after
the
crew
do
come
into
the
kurtz
compound
.
the
film
slow
down
to
a
drag
.
sheen
seem
forever
capture
by
a
madman
,
play
by
brando
be
a
lazy
performance
that
be
not
deserving
of
the
accolade
it
receive
.
brando
be
in
the
film
for
no
more
than
15
minute
,
but
be
bath
in
shadow
the
entire
time
,
make
the
last
half
hour
of
the
film
visually
pathetic
.
the
scene
be
poorly
do
,
the
dialogue
be
muffle
,
and
the
whole
mess
be
utterly
confusing
beyond
all
belief
.
sheen
seem
to
adore
this
man
,
but
why
the
viewer
be
never
tell
.
the
entire
journey
be
suppose
to
be
a
prelude
for
a
stunning
entrance
of
this
god-like
kurtz
,
but
the
scene
fall
way
short
of
expectation
.
grant
,
it
have
its
moment
,
which
be
brutally
horrific
,
but
the
general
feeling
be
one
of
confusion
.
brando
mumble
he
line
in
a
incoherent
stir
,
and
my
feeling
be
that
this
could
never
be
a
great
man
,
this
could
never
be
a
man
who
inspire
hundred
to
follow
he
,
so
why
do
they
do
it
?
there
be
moment
of
brilliance
,
but
the
visual
confusion
dilute
the
power
of
the
scene
.
there
be
too
many
question
leave
unanswered
with
the
character
of
kurtz
to
have
a
satisfying
ending
.
the
finest
scene
at
the
end
be
sheen
's
escape
,
and
he
entrace
into
the
temple
.
he
rise
out
of
the
water
,
with
the
smoke
come
off
of
he
slicked
head
,
be
a
brilliant
30
seconds
of
film
.
yet
,
you
can
not
shake
the
feeling
that
there
be
so
much
more
this
film
could
have
do
.
the
psychotic
ride
be
unforgettable
at
time
,
and
indeed
the
film
on
the
whole
be
very
good
.
it
be
a
stunningly
flaw
expression
of
film
,
for
it
address
major
issue
,
such
as
man
's
mental
stamen
during
bout
of
war
.
but
one
still
can
not
shake
the
feeling
that
this
film
could
have
so
much
more
powerful
,
have
the
character
of
kurtz
be
more
explore
,
and
have
sheen
truly
succumb
to
the
fate
that
the
viewer
think
he
be
destine
for
.
there
be
too
much
good
material
in
here
not
to
be
call
a
masterpiece
,
but
it
could
have
be
so
much
more
rewarding
.
