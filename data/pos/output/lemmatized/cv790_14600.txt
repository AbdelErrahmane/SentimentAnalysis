will
and
chri
be
idiot
brother
force
by
they
father
to
work
begrudgingly
in
the
family
flower
business
during
the
day
.
at
night
they
pursue
they
life-long
ambition
to
loose
they
virginity
in
fail
attempt
to
get
into
the
roxbury
in
beverly
hill
,
can
,
the
only
disco
act
worth
go
to
.
the
only
problem
,
the
place
be
so
popular
and
the
wait
line
so
long
that
by
the
time
the
brother
make
it
to
the
front
door
,
the
roxbury
close
,
all
the
while
bear
witness
to
guy
with
one-hundred-dollar
bill
and
movie
star
like
richard
grieco
who
get
past
the
doorman
without
fuss
.
the
script
author
-lrb-
steve
koren
,
will
ferrell
and
chri
kattan
-rrb-
cleverly
devise
a
way
for
we
boy
to
get
into
the
roxbury
.
they
flower-shop
van
be
rear-end
by
richard
grieco
,
who
fear
a
law-suit
and
be
surprise
to
see
the
idiot
be
too
star-struck
to
think
about
the
car
accident
they
just
have
,
but
not
about
get
into
the
roxbury
.
grieco
happily
take
they
in
,
even
introduce
they
to
the
owner
,
which
have
the
add
benefit
of
enhance
the
financial
appearance
of
the
idiot
brother
in
the
eye
of
a
couple
of
gold
digger
-lrb-
elisa
donovan
and
gigus
rice
-rrb-
who
bet
they
time
and
body
on
will
and
chri
.
what
follow
be
some
of
the
best
slap-stick
dancing
routine
ever
.
the
music
be
superb
,
and
could
have
only
be
make
better
have
the
producer
add
patrick
hernandez
's
bear
to
be
alive
.
the
choreography
at
time
be
a
parody
of
a
era
go
by
,
for
example
,
the
bee
gee
and
they
stayin
'
alive
.
it
be
nostalgic
for
those
of
we
who
remember
that
far
back
,
and
the
technique
be
a
clever
adaptation
that
work
well
in
forest
gump
.
one
of
the
funniest
scene
be
when
the
gold
digger
discover
that
will
and
chri
do
not
have
any
mone
y
,
and
dump
both
on
the
spot
,
even
express
violence
and
anger
that
they
give
sex
away
.
a
art-imitates-life
poke
at
shallow
woman
.
it
be
a
scene
that
be
a
approximate
parody
of
the
vinegar
's
own
rolf
luedeke
's
editorial
this
week
national
organization
for
man
-lrb-
nom
-rrb-
replace
now
.
ted
''
unabomber
''
kaczynskus
,
himself
reject
for
not
have
money
,
will
identify
well
with
this
scene
,
if
he
ever
watch
the
movie
.
of
course
,
the
script
would
not
be
complicate
enough
without
add
molly
shannon
,
the
girl
next
door
who
have
have
a
crush
on
will
since
they
be
kid
,
and
who
will
have
have
a
aversion
to
in
quest
of
good-looking
disco
blonde
-lrb-
proof
that
man
will
turn
down
perfectly
good
woman
when
there
be
bay
watch
babe
always
lurk
nearby
-rrb-
.
nevertheless
,
will
's
father
want
he
to
marry
molly
anyway
,
but
think
idiot
chri
be
stand
in
the
way
and
send
he
into
guest-quarter
exile
.
during
the
wedding
ceremony
,
will
's
heart
be
not
exactly
into
get
married
,
and
when
he
brother
appear
on
the
balcony
with
a
ghetto
blaster
and
more
head-bopping
music
,
will
think
worse
of
the
knot-tieing
idea
and
run
to
chri
.
definitely
a
snl
parody
of
the
graduate
where
katharine
ross
change
she
mind
for
the
scream
dustin
hoffman
in
the
church
balcony
.
i
find
this
scene
a
riot
,
however
,
it
go
over
brandus
's
head
--
she
be
bear
seven
year
after
the
graduate
first
appear
.
the
scene
have
a
good
punch
line
when
molly
shannon
marry
,
instead
,
the
step-in
buddy\/weight-lifter
-lrb-
who
look
like
he
could
pass
for
the
son
of
gary
busy
-rrb-
and
who
have
be
lust
for
a
good-looker
for
a
long
time
,
but
ready
now
to
take
anyone
.
more
art-imitates-life
stuff
--
not
even
muscle
can
substitute
for
money
in
the
real
world
.
the
idiot
'
mother
be
play
by
lonus
anderson
,
whose
barbie-doll
look
do
not
play
well
anymore
-lrb-
she
be
a
bit
old
-rrb-
,
and
whose
cleavage
look
like
someone
botch
a
tracheotomy
too
low
down
.
i
recommend
this
movie
for
anyone
who
want
to
have
a
lot
of
fun
or
in
need
of
a
lot
of
laugh
.
go
with
a
date

non-stop
,
as
i
do
,
and
