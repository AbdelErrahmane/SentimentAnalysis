i
wish
i
could
say
that
there
be
something
more
to
the
new
star
war
installment
than
what
you
see
in
the
commercial
,
but
there
be
not
.
george
luca
be
a
expert
at
craft
triumphant
,
special
effects-bound
flick
and
he
have
do
it
again
.
this
be
the
first
star
war
film
i
have
see
on
the
big
screen
,
so
,
of
course
,
the
impact
be
much
greater
than
when
i
watch
the
three
original
episode
on
video
.
what
be
compelling
about
the
phantom
menace
be
not
its
disposable
story
,
but
its
amazing
visual
.
basically
,
the
film
's
plot
be
center
around
trade
dispute
between
two
planet
.
qui-gon
-lrb-
liam
neeson
-rrb-
and
he
young
apprentice
obi-wan
kenobus
-lrb-
ewan
mcgregor
-rrb-
set
out
with
the
animated
jar-jar
bink
to
fix
the
mess
that
may
result
in
war
.
when
they
ship
break
down
and
they
be
strand
,
they
find
a
young
boy
,
anakin
skywalker
-lrb-
jake
lloyd
-rrb-
and
he
slave
mother
.
qui-gon
strongly
believe
that
anakin
be
destine
for
jedus
greatness
and
immediately
take
he
under
he
wing
.
anakin
participate
in
a
heart-pounding
podrace
,
one
of
the
highlight
of
the
film
,
to
get
the
equipment
need
to
fix
qui-gon
's
ship
.
however
,
most
everyone
be
doubtful
about
entrust
the
future
to
some
unknown
slave
boy
.
meanwhile
,
queen
amadalum
-lrb-
natalie
portman
-rrb-
be
frustrated
and
at
wit
's
end
,
be
na
?
ve
and
young
and
have
so
much
responsibility
on
she
shoulder
.
there
be
hardly
any
emotional
scene
in
the
film
-
even
when
we
discover
that
anakin
will
be
leave
he
slave
mother
behind
to
begin
jedus
training
,
the
frenzied
excitement
of
the
whole
film
wear
down
the
poignancy
to
the
size
of
a
crumb
.
this
do
not
prove
that
the
phantom
menace
be
poorly
make
for
it
be
brilliantly
make
.
in
all
the
star
war
film
,
human
emotion
that
we
,
the
audience
,
can
identify
with
be
usually
nil
,
but
the
film
be
for
pure
enjoyment
,
not
for
uplift
purpose
.
despite
the
fun
of
watch
the
movie
,
the
phantom
menace
be
not
without
flaw
.
for
starter
,
we
have
the
ill-conceived
,
moronic
character
jar-jar
bink
who
should
be
consider
a
threat
to
star
war
galactic
society
and
to
the
audience
.
what
a
klutz
!
george
luca
clumsily
try
to
create
a
fun
character
that
would
be
as
memorable
as
,
say
,
yoda
,
r2-d2
,
or
c3-po
,
but
,
alas
,
he
effort
be
in
vain
.
secondly
-lrb-
this
may
be
good
or
bad
,
depend
on
you
point
of
view
-rrb-
,
the
movie
's
atmosphere
be
so
different
from
the
familiar
comic-book
feel
of
the
previous
three
star
war
installment
.
this
be
due
,
perhaps
,
to
the
utter
complexity
to
this
movie
's
plot
and
the
higher
level
of
sophistication
of
the
visual
effect
use
here
.
the
movie
seem
to
be
reach
for
epic
proportion
.
i
can
not
say
much
about
the
acting
,
though
act
have
never
be
what
you
see
star
war
movie
for
anyway
.
however
,
there
be
absolutely
no
pizzazz
to
the
performance
-
they
be
straightforward
and
,
at
time
,
stale
.
natalie
portman
have
a
great
presence
,
but
she
turn
as
queen
amadalum
make
the
queen
a
stoic
,
unfeeling
?
enigma
.
there
be
nothing
we
can
hold
onto
in
she
performance
to
make
we
believe
the
trade
predicament
be
anything
of
importance
.
jake
lloyd
be
the
only
actor
here
who
have
a
ounce
of
evident
spunk
.
despite
the
inevitable
fault
,
there
be
so
much
to
enjoy
about
the
movie
.
the
heighten
excitement
of
the
final
sequence
do
not
quite
surpass
the
famous
the
empire
strike
back
climactic
scene
,
but
they
be
amazing
and
edge-of-your-seat
fun
in
they
own
rite
.
the
film
be
a
treasure
to
look
at
.
the
visual
effect
be
astonishing
99
.
8
%
of
the
time
-
the
awe-inspiring
,
mouth-opening
,
eye-popping
sight
of
the
underwater
city
be
nothing
short
of
production
design
and
special
effect
genius
.
not
since
1997
's
the
fifth
element
have
there
be
a
film
as
drench
in
visual
treat
as
this
one
.
the
production
design
be
reminiscent
of
the
fifth
element
,
the
previous
star
war
movie
,
kubrick
's
2001
,
maybe
even
of
fritz
lang
's
classic
silent
metropolis
.
however
,
all
the
set
be
so
original
.
the
original
star
war
movie
can
not
even
match
the
grandeur
of
this
film
's
visual
and
that
be
a
sheer
pleasure
for
the
viewer
-
it
give
we
hope
of
even
greater
thing
for
the
upcome
episode
.
the
costume
be
remarkable
and
have
jean-paul
gaultier
write
all
over
they
.
whether
its
queen
amadalum
's
gigantic
wardrobe
complete
with
gold-embroidery
and
feather
,
or
the
jedi
'
simple
brown
uniform
,
the
costume
designer
have
fuse
talent
with
outrageousness
.
the
costume
be
one
of
the
true
delight
of
watch
the
movie
.
as
for
john
william
'
score
,
i
do
not
think
he
be
do
one
as
complex
or
powerful
since
?
i
can
not
even
remember
.
it
be
as
epic
as
he
schindler
's
list
score
and
as
thrilling
and
zestful
as
jaw
.
it
include
the
bare
bone
of
he
music
from
the
previous
three
film
,
but
william
have
add
on
,
make
the
music
much
more
intense
and
move
.
what
with
the
overwhelming
hoopla
that
circle
this
movie
,
one
might
come
in
with
high
expectation
and
be
disappoint
.
there
be
very
little
to
hate
in
the
film
:
it
be
a
very
accomplished
and
skillfully
make
flick
.
it
be
the
best
''
fun
''
film
and
the
best
big-budget
film
out
today
,
most
definitely
.
