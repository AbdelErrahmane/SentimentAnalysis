film

absurdly
spacious
bachelor
apartment
-rrb-
,
and
a
great
deal
of
dialogue
.
embrace
a
near
real-time
approach
,
this
be
a
highly
theatrical
feature
that
completely
hang
upon
the
performance
of
its
three
actor
and
the
quality
of
the
dialogue
write
by
mr
.
toback
for
he
banter
character
.
fortunately
,
the
film
's
cast
be
up
to
the
challenge
,
and
the
wordy
exchange
between
the
triad
of
character
,
while
admittedly
variable
,
be
occasionally
wickedly
amusing
.
the
film
's
setup
be
fairly
generic
in
nature
,
and
open
rather
unpromisingly
.
we
meet
self-possessed
blonde
carlum
and
feisty
brunette
lou
,
both
wait
outside
a
soho
loft
.
as
they
engage
in
idle
chatter
,
it
be
reveal
that
they
be
both
wait
for
they
respective
boyfriend
to
return
from
the
airport
,
and
it
do
not
take
long
for
they
to
come
to
the
realisation
that
they
be
be
two-time
by
the
same
guy
.
more
indignant
with
he
than
catty
with
each
other
,
the
duo
break
into
blake
's
loft
and
await
he
arrival
for
a
confrontation
.
it
be
when
blake
return
to
he
abode
where
the
film
hit
its
stride
.
play
with
magnificent
bombast
by
mr
.
downey
jr
.
,
blake
be
a
cad
,
all
right
,
but
a
captivatingly
dynamic
,
blusterous
,
and
stealthy
piece
of
work
that
burst
onto
the
scene
and
raise
the
stake
to
new
height
.
it
be
fascinating
to
watch
this
character
in
he
natural
habitat
,
and
perhaps
the
film
's
best
choice
be
to
have
he
two
girlfriend
scamper
off
into
hide
upon
he
return
,
allow
we
to
size
up
blake
not
with
he
interaction
with
other
,
but
by
he
own
innate
behavior
.
whether
he
be
flamboyantly
behind
he
piano
in
a
rollick
rendition
of
vivaldus
,
or
on
the
phone
leave
message
to
he
beloved
-lrb-
carlum
,
lou
,
and
he
unseen
sickly
mother
-rrb-
,
it
be
never
less
than
wildly
entertaining
and
insightful
.
though
at
this
point
i
almost
hope
the
film
would
transform
into
a
one-man
show
--
a
typical
afternoon
in
the
life
of
blake
,
if
you
will
--
carlum
,
and
then
lou
,
reveal
themselves
,
and
the
spark
begin
to
fly
.
-lrb-
one
of
the
great
touch
in
the
film
be
how
blake
,
when
startle
by
carlum
's
unannounced
appearance
,
begin
to
both
verbally
and
physically
backpedal
even
before
he
realize
that
the
cat
's
out
of
the
bag
.
-rrb-
double-team
by
the
understandably
aggrieved
woman
-lrb-
who
be
more
smirkingly
inquisitive
than
ferociously
vengeful
--
they
want
a
justification
for
he
ongoing
hypocrisy
-rrb-
,
a
increasingly-flustered
blake
weakly
defend
himself
with
apologetic
and
even
self-righteous
declaration
against
they
verbal
jab
.
surprisingly
delightful
in
the
waltz
of
scathing
witty
banter
share
by
its
trio
of
character
,
two
girl
and
a
guy
conclude
its
first
sequence
with
a
unexpected
apoplectic
act
of
such
outrageous
audacity
that
it
seem
nothing
be
off-limits
for
this
film
.
however
,
it
would
be
unfeasible
to
attempt
to
string
along
carlum
and
lou
's
outrage
to
full
feature-length
,
and
it
be
as
the
movie
gradually
transform
into
the
sharing
of
exploratory
profundity
on
the
nature
of
fidelity
and
relationship
that
it
slowly
but
surely
begin
to
unravel
.
the
dialogue
become
less
and
less
engaging
and
clever
,
the
film
's
tempo
lose
its
liveliness
,
the
dynamic
between
the
character
evolve
in
unconvincing
fashion

and

and

in
a
bitter
,
long-running
dispute
with

to

scene

to

a
r-rated

and
while
admittedly
titillate
,
the
net

of
the
vignette
on

thematic
narrative
be
rather
dubious
.
if
anything
,
two

serve
as
a
showcase
for
the
phenomenal
talent
of
mr

be
put
to
the
test
in

he
play
the

from

to

yet
he

so
smoothly

it

disquieting
in
its
resonance
