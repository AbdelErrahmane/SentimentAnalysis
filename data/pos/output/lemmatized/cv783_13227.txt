cinema
have
be
around
for
about
a
hundred
year
now
.
?
it
be
not
my
job
to
recap
this
century
every
time
i
talk
about
a
new
film
,
but
i
would
like
to
think
that
i
be
begin
to
understand
the
art
more
as
i
watch
more
film
from
before
my
time
.
recently
,
i
have
see
the
film
of
hitchcock
,
capra
,
fellinus
,
godard
,
kurosawa
,
chaplin
,
lang
,
and
many
other
.
?
those
man
be
talented
artist
,
and
they
film
reflect
they
genius
.
?
they
be
likely
to
be
remember
for
.
.
.
well
,
quite
a
while
.
?
i
like
this
film
,
too
.
?
yes
,
it
be
a
disaster-slash-action
movie
.
?
true
,
its
budget
be
a
lot
more
money
than
i
'll
ever
see
in
my
lifetime
.
?
and
there
be
not
a
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
only
reason
it
be
conceive
be
to
make
a
lot
of
money
.
?
in
fact
,
i
bet
the
producer
of
armageddon
would
have
work
towards
a
lousy
film
,
have
they
think
it
would
have
be
more
profitable
.
i
certainly
do
not
care
what
they
intention
be
,
because
michael
bay
-lrb-
the
rock
-rrb-
be
such
a
skilled
director
that
i
doubt
he
have
ever
make
a
film
that
be
difficult
to
sit
through
.
of
course
,
skillful
direction
do
not
complete
the
package
,
but
the
rest
of
armageddon
manage
to
keep
everything
together
.
the
story
be
well-thought
out
-lrb-
and
perfectly
pace
to
provide
for
a
abundance
of
action
sequence
that
never
feel
out
of
place
-rrb-
,
the
acting
be
terrific
,
the
script
be
sharp
,
and
--
get
this
--
there
be
character
.
yes
,
you
read
that
right
.
armageddon
actually
have
character
you
can
care
about
!
if
you
do
not
like
this
film
,
then
you
have
a
problem
with
the
genre
itself
:
armageddon
be
as
good
as
a
film
like
this
can
be
.
if
you
have
see
deep
impact
,
then
you
know
the
basic
framework
for
the
story
.
it
turn
out
that
a
asteroid
the
size
of
texa
be
go
to
strike
the
earth
eighteen
day
from
the
start
of
the
film
.
so
,
it
be
up
to
the
u
.
s
.
government
to
stop
it
.
-lrb-
why
the
u
.
s
.
be
always
exclusively
saddle
with
these
problem
be
never
fully
investigate
.
-rrb-
they
plan
--
to
send
a
group
of
experienced
oil
driller
up
to
the
asteroid
,
drill
down
several
hundred
foot
,
and
detonate
a
nuclear
warhead
within
.
the
head
driller
be
harry
stamper
-lrb-
bruce
willi
-rrb-
.
he
group
of
man
be
a
colorful
bunch
,
include
a
.
j
.
-lrb-
ben
affleck
-rrb-
,
chick
-lrb-
will
patton
-rrb-
,
and
rockhound
-lrb-
steve
buscemus
-rrb-
.
there
be
also
a
interesting
triangle
form
between
a
.
j
.
,
harry
,
and
grace
-lrb-
liv
tyler
-rrb-
,
who
be
harry
's
daughter
.
a
.
j
.
and
grace
be
,
of
course
,
romantically
intertwine
,
and
dad
be
not
too
happy
with
the
situation
.
it
be
absurd
to
wish
for
a
complicated
story
in
a
event
movie
or
a
special
effect
movie
or
whatever
it
be
you
would
like
to
call
armageddon
.
it
be
not
about
story
--
it
be
about
viscera
and
action
,
and
thrills-a-minute
,
and
all
that
stuff
.
it
be
incidental
,
really
,
that
the
story
be
cohesive
and
even
remotely
believable
,
because
most
people
will
be
too
wrap
up
in
the
explosion
to
give
two
seconds
'
think
to
what
actually
happen
.
but
bay
be
the
one
to
congratulate
in
this
case
,
for
he
have
make
a
film
so
entertaining
and
so
visually
sharp
that
i
doubt
any
director
could
have
do
it
better
.
i
think
most
of
the
budget
go
to
camera
alone
,
because
bay
film
every
action
sequence
from
about
thirty
or
forty
different
angle
.
take
the
spectacular
opening
scene
,
for
instance
,
in
which
a
meteor
shower
obliterate
new
york
.
a
meteor
fly
out
of
the
sky
and
crash
into
a
building
,
which
send
fireball
erupt
into
the
air
and
car
spin
like
top
upon
other
car
.
the
action
itself
might
take
five
seconds
in
real
life
,
but
bay
edit
so
quickly
that
we
get
the
same
scene
in
six
different
way
.
i
like
he
quick-edit
style
,
because
it
be
abrasive
and
exhausting
to
watch
.
it
be
also
very
loud
,
and
obnoxiously
noisy
at
time
.
but
it
be
fun
to
be
obnoxious
sometimes
.
the
special
effect
in
this
film
put
every
other
1998
blockbuster
to
shame
.
deep
impact
,
visually
,
have
absolutely
nothing
on
armageddon
,
and
to
offer
a
comparison
between
the
quality
of
this
film
and
godzillum
be
simply
laughable
.
special
effect
be
very
important
in
a
film
like
this
:
if
they
be
not
good
,
then
the
image
be
not
convincing
,
and
the
film
do
not
work
.
everything
here
look
bright
and
explosive
--
from
the
little
meteor
burst
through
skyscraper
,
all
the
way
to
the
shot
of
the
earth
through
the
jut
rock
on
the
ominously
approach
asteroid
.
the
effect
that
do
not
look
totally
real
be
still
a
pleasure
to
behold
,
and
i
credit
everyone
involve
for
create
the
first
blockbuster
so
nice-looking
that
it
actually
qualify
as
art
.
of
course
,
all
of
this
would
add
up
to
little
more
than
a
above-average
light
show
,
if
i
do
not
get
the
feeling
that
bay
care
as
much
about
he
character
as
he
do
about
he
action
.
the
film
be
two
and
a
half
hour
long
,
and
not
all
of
that
be
spend
submerge
in
numbing
action
.
much
of
the
film
be
dedicate
to
develop
the
various
character
'
subplot
.
i
will
not
suggest
that
these
be
complex
character
,
but
they
problem
be
real
,
and
the
emotion
be
not
put
forth
in
a
sentimental
and
overbearing
way
.
in
fact
,
there
be
three
or
four
scene
here
that
have
I
pretty
choke
up
,
and
that
be
a
lot
more
than
i
can
say
about
deep
impact
,
which
be
bank
on
the
feel-good
part
of
its
story
.
bruce
willi
be
terrific
,
and
i
be
glad
to
see
he
bigger
than
life
again
-lrb-
recent
turn
in
film
like
mercury
rise
have
be
very
disappointing
-rrb-
.
tyler
and
affleck
be
great
together
,
and
make
a
convincing
couple
--
all
of
the
scene
between
they
work
on
a
comfortable
level
.
patton
,
who
be
a
magnificent
actor
,
thankfully
be
not
waste
here
,
and
the
minor
subplot
revolve
around
he
ex-wife
and
son
be
very
move
.
the
comic
relief
from
buscemus
and
peter
stormare
-lrb-
who
play
a
crazy
russian
astronaut
-rrb-
be
nifty
,
and
keep
the
film
lively
and
funny
.
i
be
not
challenge
to
think
real
hard
while
watch
armageddon
,
and
i
do
not
mind
too
much
.
but
the
film
do
not
insult
my
intelligence
--
it
be
pitched
perfectly
to
entertain
,
which
be
what
all
it
really
want
to
do
.
it
be
not
mindless
and
escapist
,
but
well-crafted
cinema
.
it
might
have
be
create
for
the
wrong
reason
,
but
man
like
michael
bay
have
my
respect
for
show
I
that
they
be
interested
in
make
something
good
,
in
spite
of
the
producer
and
the
budget
.
i
be
not
say
that
film
like
this
be
risky
move
.
what
i
be
say
be
that
armageddon
be
a
big
,
loud
,
expensive
motion
picture
that
remind
I
that
art
often
come
in
the
strangest
of
form
.
