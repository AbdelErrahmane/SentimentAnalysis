i
actually
be
a
fan
of
the
original
1961
or
so
live-action-disney
flick
of
the
same
name
star
hayley
mill
twice
as
a
pair
of
twin
,
separate
at
birth
by
divorce
parent
,
never
to
come
in
contact
with
the
other
so
the
parent
never
have
to
meet
again
.
and
everyone
should
know
how
i
feel
about
remake
,
especially
of
film
i
happen
to
enjoy
-lrb-
my
fallacy
:
unless
you
be
go
to
either
capture
the
same
exact
spirit
of
the
original
or
do
something
different
with
it
or
maybe
even
both
,
just
wrack
you
brain
and
come
up
with
a
\*
gasp
\*
new
idea
-rrb-
.
this
remake
be
not
originally
on
the
top
of
my
viewing
list
,
and
be
actually
quite
the
opposite
.
contemporary
live-action-disney
film
be
not
one
of
my
favorty
,
anyway
:
they
be
usually
unfunny
,
alienate
,
and
a
big
fat
bear
,
at
least
to
anyone
over
the
age
of
11
and
above
the
iq
of
10
.
this
one
,
however
,
be
shockingly
not
bad
.
in
fact
,
it
be
actually
good
.
not
the
original
good
,
but
what
be
great
about
it
be
that
it
do
not
necessarily
retread
the
original
or
capture
the
same
exact
spirit
as
it
do
become
entertaining
for
the
same
exact
reason
the
original
be
entertaining
.
because
it
be
cute
and
innocent
fun
.
because
it
have
a
pretty
killer
plot
that
be
endlessly
fun
to
follow
along
with
.
because
the
lead
star
be
immensely
appealing
.
because
the
parent
be
also
immensely
appealing
.
and
-lrb-
i
be
repeat
myself
-rrb-
because
it
be
cute
and
innocent
fun
.
there
be
nothing
too
risque
about
it
,
save
the
plot
-lrb-
the
idea
of
separate
twin
and
deny
they
the
truth
for
year
be
ominously
selfish
,
but
that
be
precisely
the
point
of
the
movie
-rrb-
,
and
it
be
aim
directly
at
either
kid
,
adult
who
want
to
remember
the
original
,
or
young
adult
who
want
to
remember
what
it
be
like
to
be
a
kid
.
i
,
personally
,
be
somewhere
between
the
second
and
third
.
i
can
vividly
remember
when
my
taste
in
movie
be
not
so
weird
or
diverse
-lrb-
the
name
godard
and
kubrick
be
not
even
a
glimmer
in
my
right
eye
back
then
-rrb-
,
when
i
would
tune
in
every
Sunday
night
for
a
couple
year
to
see
abc
's
''
wonderful
world
of
disney
,
''
where
they
would
show
you
a
live-action
and\/or
made-for-tv
disney
flick
a
hour
per
week
.
i
can
remember
my
mom
take
my
sister
and
i
along
with
all
my
friend
and
they
mother
to
see
all
the
rerelease
disney
film
-lrb-
like
''
lady
and
the
tramp
''
and
''
pinnochio
''
-rrb-
.
and
,
most
sadly
,
i
remember
every
single
christmas
,
without
fail
,
there
be
a
barage
of
child
's
animated
half-hour
show
,
make
exclusively
for
the
christmas
season
,
that
i
would
not
dare
miss
.
i
can
even
remember
see
the
made-for-tv
''
parent
trap
ii
''
on
tv
one
night
,
and
after
i
have
see
that
one
over
and
over
and
over
again
,
i
see
the
original
''
parent
trap
.
''
it
be
more
of
a
late
childhood
movie
,
because
it
deal
with
the
issue
of
divorce
,
but
it
deal
with
it
in
a
disney-ized
version
.
it
be
playful
,
and
witty
,
and
charming
,
and
if
i
see
it
for
the
first
time
right
now
,
have
never
experience
that
part
of
my
childhood
,
i
would
probably
dismiss
it
.
i
would
probably
do
the
same
for
the
new
version
of
the
same
movie
if
i
have
not
see
the
original
at
such
a
perfect
age
.
watch
it
,
i
could
remember
what
fun
it
be
to
watch
a
disney
film
,
and
how
divorce
for
I
start
to
get
I
think
about
the
possibility
of
my
seemingly-perfect
parent
splitting
up
,
and
how
it
affect
my
adolescence
.
and
also
how
it
brush
that
fear
off
with
a
smooth
stroke
,
and
point
out
that
even
in
the
most
fucked-up
of
situation
,
thing
could
always
work
out
if
you
,
well
,
manipulate
thing
a
bit
,
at
least
for
the
better
.
this
new
version
do
that
for
I
,
but
it
be
also
charming
in
its
own
way
.
it
have
a
new
cast
,
a
contemporary
feel
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
in
awhile
for
a
live-action-disney
flick
,
a
tone
that
be
not
corny
or
condescending
,
but
just
right
.
the
moment
that
would
otherwise
seem
corny
be
actually
affect
in
a
safe
kind
of
way
.
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
original
film
,
the
kid
actually
know
better
than
the
foolish
adult
.
the
story
be
basically
classic
by
now
,
repeat
almost
as
many
time
as
kurosawa
's
''
the
seven
samurai
''
:
a
pair
of
twin
-lrb-
play
here
by
lindsay
lohan
,
just
like
they
be
play
by
hayley
mill
in
the
original
-rrb-
be
separate
at
birth
by
they
divorce
parent
.
one
,
annie
,
be
send
to
live
with
the
mother
-lrb-
natasha
richardson
,
resemble
she
mother
,
vanessa
redgrave
,
more
than
i
have
ever
notice
-rrb-
in
london
,
where
she
live
with
she
parent
and
she
devoted
,
foppish
butler
-lrb-
simon
kunz
-rrb-
,
as
she
work
as
a
swingin
'
fashion
designer
.
she
grow
up
refine
and
classy
,
but
also
with
a
keen
knowledge
in
sport
and
poker-playing
.
the
other
,
hallie
,
be
send
to
northern
californium
with
she
father
-lrb-
denni
quaid
-rrb-
to
live
on
a
vineyard
with
they
pseudo-maid
-lrb-
lisa
ann
walter
-rrb-
,
and
grow
up
rugged
yet
charming
.
they
both
meet
at
the
same
camp
,
one
that
annie
want
to
go
to
to
become
more
rugged
.
they
feud
because
they
look
all-too
similar
,
and
be
thus
in
tight
competition
,
which
result
in
some
nasty
prank
,
which
wind
they
in
seclusion
together
in
a
private
,
out-of-the-way
cabin
.
there
,
they
become
friend
,
then
learn
about
eachother
.
once
they
know
everything
,
they
concoct
a
scheme
to
switch
place
so
the
one
can
meet
the
other
parent
,
whom
they
have
only
hear
of
.
they
learn
about
eachother
's
life
in
detail
,
they
make
sure
they
look
alike
-lrb-
which
require
hair
cutting
and
,
notoriously
,
ear-piercing
-
a
scene
which
be
like
the
kiddie
version
of
the
hypodermic
needle
scene
in
''
pulp
fiction
''
-rrb-
,
and
when
the
end
of
summer
come
,
they
switch
and
hope
for
the
best
.
lindsay
lohan
do
not
necessarily
copy
the
act
style
of
hayley
mill
in
the
original
.
but
she
come
off
just
as
appeal
as
she
do
once
.
she
do
,
though
,
add
a
couple
new
thing
:
she
make
the
californium
twin
a
little
more
appealing
and
the
london
twin
a
bit
more
frank
and
snobbish
than
the
snotty
and
proper
original
,
respectively
.
she
also
add
on
a
american
and
british
accent
to
each
one
,
with
one
fake
the
other
accent
throughout
,
and
if
you
really
take
notice
,
you
can
see
that
the
fake
one
'
accent
be
not
exactly
perfect
.
she
be
also
incredibly
appealing
,
not
merely
cute
,
which
be
especially
notable
since
this
be
she
first
feature
film
,
and
we
know
how
notorious
child
actor
be
,
especially
in
they
first
film
.
she
make
a
great
protagonist
,
and
it
only
help
that
the
support
cast
be
equally
appealing
.
denni
quaid
,
in
fact
,
have
not
be
this
likable
in
about
a
decade
-
he
big
dumb
smile
and
near
cocky
attitude
be
what
have
make
he
a
notable
actor
in
the
past
,
not
just
that
he
be
mr
.
meg
ryan
.
ditto
natasha
richardson
-lrb-
except
that
she
just
have
not
ever
be
this
likable
period
-rrb-
.
the
two
make
a
win
couple
,
maybe
not
so
win
as
maureen
o'hara
and
the
late
brian
keith
in
the
original
,
but
they
still
work
for
this
film
.
instead
of
the
bickering
that
ensue
in
the
original
,
the
film
add
another
dimension
and
another
angle
to
they
character
that
be
amiss
in
the
original
:
during
the
opening
credit
,
we
see
glimpse
from
they
courtship
on
the
qe2
,
where
they
fall
quickly
and
madly
in
love
with
eachother
,
and
when
back
together
again
,
the
film
's
more
smarmy
scene
come
off
as
actually
sentimental
,
but
in
that
great
way
,
not
the
migraine-inducing
way
as
in
many
such
film
.
this
all
bring
this
new
''
parent
trap
''
to
a
level
of
entertainment
that
have
not
really
exist
since
,
well
,
the
original
film
year
ago
,
still
my
money
the
best
live-action-disney
flick
of
all
time
.
this
be
because
it
have
a
form
of
intelligence
and
wit
that
make
such
plot
point
as
a
otherwise
standard
villainous
love
interest
subplot
-lrb-
a
gold-digging
sharon
stone
type
,
play
by
elaine
hendrix
,
who
be
deliciously
torment
by
the
twin
later
on
in
the
film
-rrb-
a
treat
instead
of
a
bear
.
like
the
original
,
this
film
transcend
all
the
crap
that
it
very
well
could
be
-lrb-
case
in
point
:
''
it
take
two
''
star
the
olsen
twin
-rrb-
because
it
treat
the
child
as
the
smart
one
,
and
the
adult
as
the
silly
one
,
not
the
other
way
around
.
and
because
,
above
everything
,
it
know
exactly
how
to
be
charming
without
bite
off
more
than
it
can
chew
.
however
,
in
comparison
with
the
original
,
it
could
be
a
bit
better
.
certain
scene
work
well
,
but
not
nearly
as
well
as
they
work
in
the
original
.
i
like
the
way
the
parent
fight
over
past
dilemna
and
then
fight
over
fall
in
love
again
better
than
i
like
watch
two
old
flame
get
back
together
over
a
bottle
of
wine
-
somehow
,
feuding
be
always
more
cinematic
and
pleasing
than
mere
reminscing
,
a
lesson
extract
from
the
howard
hawks\/cary
grant
film
of
yesteryear
.
and
as
much
as
this
film
transcend
mere
cutedom
,
compare
to
the
original
,
this
film
almost
drown
in
cutedom
.
the
original
,
though
not
gritty
,
be
far
more
stylized
and
just
as
suitable
for
adult
audience
as
it
be
for
young
audience
.
as
such
,
this
remake
may
never
be
nearly
as
great
or
classic
as
the
original
film
,
but
it
at
least
know
how
to
treat
its
source
material
with
dignity
and
respect
,
and
how
to
create
virtually
the
same
effect
without
border
on
plagerism
or
petty
annoyance
.
