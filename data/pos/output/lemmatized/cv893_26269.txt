let
I
open
this
one
with
a
confession
:
i
love
cop
movie
.
i
adore
they
with
such
a
unwavering
,
near
foolish
passion
that
i
be
actually
one
of
the
first
in
line
to
see
1998
's
one
tough
cop
star
the
smirkiest
of
the
baldwin
brother
,
steven
.
be
it
any
good
?
well
,
just
about
as
good
as
baldwin
's
steven
seagal
impression
-lrb-
for
those
i
have
confuse
the
answer
be
a
resounding
no
!
-rrb-
.
now
let
I
clarify
,
i
do
not
love
just
any
cop
movie
;
i
be
not
too
keen
on
the
smug
buddy
cop
flick
that
be
so
in
vogue
in
the
80
's
and
now
slowly
-lrb-
gulp
-rrb-
return
thanks
to
jackie
chan
and
chri
tucker
.
i
be
partial
to
those
gritty
,
earthy
cop
drama
like
serpico
,
donnie
brasco
,
and
the
french
connection
.
problem
be
these
film
come
along
just
about
as
often
as
george
w
.
bush
make
a
cogent
point
so
whenever
a
''
true
''
cop
movie
do
hit
multiplex
,
i
come
run
towards
it
like
a
eager
puppy
?
?
?
and
inevitably
i
leave
,
head
bow
,
trip
over
my
squiggly
tail
.
so
what
be
it
about
cop
movie
that
transform
I
into
a
moron
willing
to
shell
out
$
7
.
50
for
a
movie
call
one
tough
cop
-lrb-
which
actually
sound
a
lot
like
a
wiseguy
spin-off
,
no
?
-rrb-
?
truth
be
i
be
a
sucker
for
those
barren
street
,
that
gritty
,
graffitus
strew
modernist
jungle
where
dangerous
criminal
lurk
and
cop
,
like
modern
day
knight
,
must
shield
we
from
they
iniquitous
clutch
.
yes
it
be
all
very
corny
and
awfully
boy
clubish
,
which
,
i
be
guess
,
be
precisely
where
these
feeling
come
from
.
as
little
tot
we
boy
be
bring
up
to
create
we
own
war
with
gi
joe
's
,
enact
cop
and
robber
or
cowboy
and
indian
fantasy
,
etc
.
the
best
gritty
cop
film
tap
into
those
gleeful
adolescent
fantasy
,
and
heighten
they
,
turn
it
all
into
a
existential
nightmare
of
thin
moral
line
and
psychological
chaos
.
as
a
adult
my
taste
have
not
change
all
that
drastically
;
sure
i
can
get
a
cerebral
high
from
the
emotional
complexity
of
a
krzysztof
kieslowskus
film
,
but
i
still
delight
at
the
promise
a
''
guy
''
film
could
potentially
bring
.
now
what
if
it
be
the
cop
who
be
the
corrupt
one
?
ooh
that
one
really
get
I
go
,
these
protector
use
all
that
at
they
service
,
take
advantage
of
other
for
they
own
gain
.
throw
a
courtroom
drama
-lrb-
yech
!
-rrb-
into
the
pot
and
you
have
the
tremendously
absorb
sidney
lumet
film
prince
of
the
city
.
how
absorb
be
prince
of
the
city
,
you
ask
?
so
damn
absorb
that
when
the
film
shift
from
gritty
undercover
cop
drama
to
courtroom
drama
-lrb-
a
sub-genre
i
loath
the
way
kristy
swanson
must
loath
sarah
michelle
gellar
-rrb-
i
remain
completely
and
utterly
involve
.
the
film
star
treat
william
,
who
give
the
kind
of
performance
that
should
have
skyrocket
he
career
up
to
the
level
that
brad
pitt
currently
reside
at
.
since
i
be
hatch
a
mere
two
year
prior
to
the
release
of
prince
of
the
city
,
i
can
not
provide
a
answer
as
to
why
it
do
not
.
-lrb-
though
judge
from
he
recent
role
in
tripe
like
deep
rise
and
dead
heat
i
would
guess
that
it
probably
have
something
to
do
with
quite
a
few
bad
career
move
-rrb-
.
like
mickey
rourke
and
eric
robert
-lrb-
both
of
whom
be
currently
do
time
in
direct
to
video
purgatory
-rrb-
william
be
a
talented
lead
man
who
do
not
make
it
to
where
he
should
have
.
-lrb-
if
there
be
any
justice
in
this
dog
go
world
keanu
reeve
would
be
the
one
banish
to
direct
to
video
hell
-rrb-
.
here
,
the
actor
be
give
a
role
not
all
that
dissimilar
from
al
pacino
's
in
serpico
-lrb-
also
direct
by
lumet
-rrb-
.
william
play
danny
ciello
,
a
member
of
a
elite
squad
of
police
officer
who
take
down
drug
dealer
on
the
gritty
pre-juliani
street
of
new
york
.
they
work
without
uniform
or
hour
much
like
pay
vigilante
.
and
that
analogy
be
more
than
apt
see
as
how
the
bunch
be
kinda
sorta
force
into
use
corrupt
means
to
get
the
job
do
.
the
squad
rely
entirely
on
informant
-lrb-
low
level
junkie
-rrb-
to
gain
access
to
the
big
wig
,
and
in
order
to
obtain
the
info
they
seek
,
they
sometimes
have
to
provide
the
junkie
with
the
junk
of
they
choice
.
danny
have
do
this
,
and
though
he
be
a
fairly
honorable
guy
,
who
take
the
job
in
order
to
do
good
,
he
intention
have
get
a
bit
skewed
along
the
way
.
he
seek
redemption
and
conclude
that
the
best
way
to
go
about
get
it
be
by
talk
to
internal
affair
who
then
convince
he
to
go
undercover
as
a
''
double
agent
''
.
he
do
so
with
one
condition
:
he
will
not
rat
on
he
partner
.
right
away
we
know
that
that
be
exactly
what
he
'll
have
to
do
.
and
watch
the
movie
build
to
that
be
thrilling
in
the
way
that
any
great
character
drive
story
can
be
.
undercover
cop
film
be
almost
innately
exciting
,
even
the
kind
that
pull
out
all
the
cliche
-lrb-
like
in
too
deep
-rrb-
.
how
can
one
not
be
move
by
the
issue
of
betrayal
,
ambiguity
,
and
the
danger
in
put
oneself
in
such
a
risky
position
?
prince
of
the
city
take
all
this
and
charge
it
with
a
perceptive
,
hard
boil
script
and
taut
unintrusive
direction
by
old
pro
sidney
lumet
,
as
well
as
a
handful
of
intense
performance
,
most
notably
by
treat
.
lumet
's
greatest
contribution
to
the
movie
be
how
he
lay
back
,
and
let
the
camera
soak
up
the
action
.
he
scene
transition
rapidly
from
one
to
the
next
building
layer
of
tension
,
and
he
rarely
hold
for
reaction
shot
,
instead
he
click
away
at
precisely
the
moment
a
character
stop
yak
.
lumet
's
worst
tendency
be
one
that
many
film
maker
-lrb-
especially
oliver
stone
-rrb-
tend
to
overuse
:
he
rely
a
little
too
heavily
on
actor
shout
they
line
at
each
other
presumably
in
order
to
ratchet
up
the
tension
.
this
be
not
as
much
a
problem
here
as
it
be
in
night
fall
on
manhattan
,
lumet
's
most
recent
cop
\
lawyer
endeavor
,
a
movie
that
nearly
give
I
a
ulcer
from
just
watch
.
though
of
late
lumet
have
make
several
really
awful
career
choice
-lrb-
maybe
he
and
treat
should
get
together
for
a
drink
or
something
-rrb-
,
the
most
recent
a
completely
unnecessary
remake
of
glorium
,
here
he
be
on
,
sustain
tension
in
a
film
that
run
for
167
minute
with
not
one
dull
spot
.
some
of
the
formulum
picture
i
like
the
best
be
the
most
simplistic
.
hollywood
often
forget
how
easy
it
be
to
make
these
kind
of
picture
even
tolerable
.
of
course
cop
movie
be
not
popular
anymore
-lrb-
yes
buddy
cop
flick
be
popular
but
those
be
more
like
extend
sitcom
with
gunfire
amid
the
punch
line
-rrb-
,
but
just
look
at
the
average
hollywood
action
movie
,
flick
so
bloated
and
full
of
unnecessary
fat
like
the
boring
love
interest
that
serve
no
purpose
other
than
to
stall
the
action
and
demonstrate
that
we
hero
be
not
gay
,
the
lame
comic
relief
character
who
be
never
funny
,
and
on
and
on
.
for
all
its
moral
ambiguity
prince
of
the
city
be
a
back
to
the
basics
cop
\
courtroom
drama
that
leave
out
all
the
crap
and
really
thrill
.
it
focus
completely
on
its
story
,
and
its
character
all
of
whom
be
completely
believable
from
the
cop
to
the
lawyer
to
the
junkie
.
there
be
a
great
scene
early
on
where
a
irate
william
shout
at
a
ia
officer
and
look
as
if
he
be
about
to
go
into
one
of
those
corny
braveheart
inspirational
speech
,
but
instead
he
break
down
in
front
of
the
cop
and
begin
sob
.
this
be
a
scene
that
would
never
make
it
into
a
michael
bay
film
-lrb-
even
though
bruce
willi
sacrifice
he
life
at
the
end
of
armageddon
,
not
one
damn
tear
-rrb-
it
would
be
cut
out
because
the
director
would
say
oh
that
make
he
too
human
,
excuse
I
,
weak
.
in
the
very
next
scene
danny
speak
in
a
hushed
raspiness
,
strain
to
get
the
word
out
.
he
be
lose
he
voice
.
do
that
little
itty
bitty
detail
matter
?
maybe
not
to
most
,
but
it
sure
make
my
night
.
and
in
a
sprawling
epic
of
corruption
,
greed
,
betrayal
and
violence
it
be
nice
to
see
that
someone
be
pay
attention
to
the
little
thing
.
