drama
,
the
practice
,
dylan
.
the
major
weak
spot
in
three
to
tango
be
the
direction
of
damon
santostefano
.
no
originality
or
technique
be
use
whatsoever
.
three
to
tango
be
lucky
that
the
script
be
so
edgy
and
that
perry
and
campbell
be
wonderful
in
comedy
,
or
else
the
film
would
have
be
a
disaster
,
as
it
be
just
plain
boring
to
look
at
.
three
to
tango
be
a
film
do
many
time
before
,
as
the
plot
be
suspiciously
close
to
1998
's
the
object
of
my
affection
,
but
the
plot
have
never
be
complete
so
well
.
three
to
tango
's
script
,
write
by
rodney
patrick
vaccaro
and
aline
brosh
mckenna
be
fun
,
fast
,
and
funny
,
deliver
not
only
original
,
hilarious
gay
joke
-lrb-
not
you
run
of
the
mill
material
-rrb-
,
but
a
certain
snappiness
in
the
dialogue
between
character
that
always
keep
you
smile
.
unlike
last
summer
's
south
park
:
bigger
,
longer
,
and
uncut
and
1997
's
in
&
out
,
three
to
tango
be
a
comedy
in
which
the
gay
element
be
not
crude
or
vulgar
.
the
script
be
wise
to
take
this
route
,
as
gay
can
not
-lrb-
i
do
not
think
so
,
anyway
-rrb-
be
offend
by
this
light
,
playful
comedy
.
-lrb-
to
prove
this
,
a
gay
couple
be
in
the
audience
who
be
laugh
constantly
.
-rrb-
three
to
tango
's
climax
be
a
hilarious
,
clever
scene
that
be
pure
irony
base
on
the
outcome
of
most
romantic-mistaken
identity
comedy
.
three
to
tango
be
a
gem
.
the
bottom
line
:
three
to
tango
be
a
light
,
sharp
,
snappy
romantic
comedy
with
a
superb
ending
,
and
great
star
.
one
of
the
better
romantic
comedy
of
1999
.
