life
as
view
by
a
outsider
.
when
those
observer

the
surreal
become
bizarre
.
when
the
life
be
that
of
jeff
''
the
dude
''
leboswkus
,
the
bizarre
fall
over
the
edge
into
the
world
of
''
what
`
sgoingonaroundhere
''
.
the
marvelous
sound
of
''
the
stranger
''
-lrb-
sam
elliot

's
voice-over
introduce
the
film
.
at
least
it
do
until
he
forget
what
he
be
go
to
say
and
give
up
.
the
dude
-lrb-
jeff
bridge
-rrb-
be
describe
as
the
''
laziest
man
in
lo
angele
,
possibly
the
world
''
,
although
he
be
not
so
much
slothful
as
he
be
relax
.
spend
the
last
30
year
with
a
roach
clip
in
one
hand
and
a
white
russian
in
the
other
,
he
do
not
have
much
of
a
life

good
time

occasional
acid
flashback
''
.

's
passion
be
bowl
.
when
he
be
not
roll
the
ball
down
a
alley
towards
a
strike
,
thing
just
happen
to
he
.
arrive
home
one
night
,
he
be
beat
by
thug
attempt
to
collect
money
that
he
wife
owe
they
.
even
worse
,
they
urinate
on
he
rug
.
the
problem
be
that
the
dude
do
not
have
a
wife
.
he
assailant
realize
that
they
target
be
a
different
lebowskus
when
they
glance
around
at
he
apartment
.
the
''
big
''
lebowskus
-lrb-
david
huddleston
-rrb-
be
a
multi-millionaire
and
he
dudeness
live
in
two-room
squalor
.
the
next
day
,
we
ragtag
hero
visit
he
namesake
's
mansion
attempt
compensation
for
he
soaked
rug
.
the
carpet
be
important
to
he
because
it
pull
the
room
together
:
not
surprisingly
since
it
be
virtually
the
only
object
there
.
when
he
be
deny
any
money
,
he
pick
up
a
replacement
rug
off
the
floor
.
on
he
way
out
,
he
run
into
lebowskus
's
trophy
babe
wife
bunny
-lrb-
tara
reid
-rrb-
who
offer
to
perform
a
sexual
act
that
,
accord
to
rumor
,
be
one
of
bill
clinton
's
favorite
for
a
thousand
buck
.
the
penniless
dude
wisecrack
that
he
be
head
for
the
cash
machine
.
later
he
get
a
unexpected
phone
call
enlist
he
aid
in
be
the
bag
man
to
deliver
a
ransom
to
bunny
's
kidnapper
.
this
begin
the
trademarked
coen
brother
crimes-gone-wrong
sequence
.
the
kidnapper
be
impossibly
inept
.
the
dude
and
he
crony
be
even
worse
.
every
plan
go
awry
.
you
can
almost
see
lebowskus
's
brain
churning
in
slow
motion
as
he
try
to
figure
out
the
clue
.
that
be
the
story
,
but
to
tell
the
truth
it
do
not
much
matter
.
there
could
be
almost
any
plot
and
the
film
would
be
just
as
entertaining
.
the
narrative
only
exist
so
we
can
watch
the
offbeat
character
and
the
quirky
predicament
they
fall
into
.
the
dude
's
bowling
buddy
walter
-lrb-
john
goodman
-rrb-
and
donny
-lrb-
steve
buscemus
-rrb-
look
like
people
you
would
see
on
the
street
but
,
like
everything
else
in
this
film
,
they
be
not
quite
what
they
seem
.
walter
be
a
vet
as
stick
in
vietnam
as
the
dude
be
in
the
sixty
.
everything
that
happen
remind
he
of
a
situation
in
the
nam
.
when
a
fellow
bowler
cross
the
foul
line
but
will
not
admit
it
,
walter
pull
a
gun
on
he
until
he
mark
a
zero
on
the
score
sheet
.
donny
get
precious
few
word
in
between
walter
's
scream
and
the
dude
's
rambling
.
when
he
do
,
walter
shout
he
down
with
horrendous
albeit
seemingly
unintentional
bowling
pun
.
donny
be
''
out
of
he
league
''
and
do
not
''
have
a
frame
of
reference
''
.
the
film
be
pepper
with
people
for
whom
the
term
''
character
''
would
be
a
understatement
.
the
big
lebowskus
's
daughter
maude
,
a
avant-garde
''
vaginal
''
artist
,
paint
while
swing
naked
in
a
leather
apparatus
like
a
s
&
m
mary
martin
.
the
kidnapper
be
german
techno
nihilist
biker
.
bunny
lebowskus
be
a
high
school
cheerleader
turn
porno
star
.
most
impressive
be
john
turturro
in
he
far
too
small
role
as
a
hispanic
bowler
.
as
the
flamenco
music
swell
,
we
see
he
put
on
he
lavender
hose
.
the
camera
pan
up
to
a
all-purple
skin-tight
bowling
outfit
with
''
jesus
''
-lrb-
pronounce
with
a
''
j
''
,
not
a
''
h
''
-rrb-
embroider
on
the
pocket
.
he
address
the
lane
with
intense
seriousness
and
one
paint
fingernail
.
he
tongue
slowly
snake
out
and
lovingly
lick
the
glowing
bowling
ball
.
bridge
work
the
dude
as
if
he
have
be
live
he
for
decade
and
maybe
he
have
.
i
can
not
think
of
anyone
else
who
could
have
do
a
better
job
.
buscemus
have
a
limited
role
,
but
he
play
it
perfectly
.
the
more
that
i
see
john
goodman
the
more
convinced
i
be
that
he
be
one
of
the
treasure
of
we
time
.
it
be
odd
to
think
that
most
of
the
world
know
he
only
as
roseanne
barr
's
television
husband
.
more
like
the
coen
's
''
raise
arizona
''
than
they
hit
''
fargo
''
,
''
the
big
lebowskus
''
demand
a
open
mind
and
even
more
open
eye
.
a
mark
of
the
coen
brother
be
that
even
with
all
wonderful
dream
sequence
and
the
broad
slapstick
physical
comedy
on
the
screen
,
much
of
the
humor
be
subtle
and
easy
to
miss
.
there
be
so
much
go
on
that
frequently
it
disappear
before
you
can
see
it
.
walk
out
of
the
theater
,
i
feel
that
the
film
have
something
important
to
say
.
on
further
examination
,
i
be
not
sure
exactly
what
it
be
.
''
if
you
meet
jesus
at
the
bowling
alley
,
it
be
not
go
to
be
what
you
expect
''
?
''
when
the
go
get
weird
,
the
weird
go
bowling
''
?
maybe
there
be
no
real
message
.
perhaps
it
be
just
a
roller
coaster
ride
through
a
hilarious
world
.
maybe
that
be
enough
.
