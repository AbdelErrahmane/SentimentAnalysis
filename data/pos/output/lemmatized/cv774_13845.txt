almost
a
full
decade
before
steven
spielberg
's
saving
private
ryan
ask
whether
a
film
could
be
both
''
anti
war
''
and
''
pro-soldier
''
,
john
irvin
's
hamburger
hill
prove
it
could
.
lose
in
the
inundation
of
critical
acclaim
that
greet
oliver
stone
's
platoon
,
this
excellent
film
be
dismiss
as
''
too
militaristic
''
.
it
be
hard
to
understand
exactly
why
--
unless
irvin
,
in
assemble
he
motley
collection
of
young
man
who
for
predictable
-lrb-
and
often
naive
-rrb-
reason
''
choose
to
show
up
''
for
the
vietnam
debacle
,
--
have
refuse
to
present
we
with
the
stone
killer
,
drug-stoked
psycho
and
ruthless
opportunist
who
have
become
to
vietnam
war
epic
what
''
the
polack
,
the
hillbilly
and
the
kid
from
brooklyn
''
become
to
wwii
movie
.
hamburger
hill
,
base
on
a
true
story
,
be
not
a
easy
film
to
watch
.
there
be
a
scene
that
will
have
gray
anti-war
activist
squirm
in
they
seat
,
or
move
to
genuine
tear
.
and
the
climactic
final
assault
on
the
''
hill
''
in
question
be
visually
confusing
.
gristly
reality
be
present
in
brief
flash
,
as
if
the
brain
dare
not
acknowledge
what
it
have
encounter
.
and
in
the
mud
and
smoke
officer
and
enlistee
,
veteran
and
''
newbie
''
,
black
soldier
and
white
,
become
almost
indistinguishable
from
each
other
,
as
they
do
in
the
chaos
of
actual
combat
.
the
act
throughout
be
solid
with
a
absolutely
stellar
performance
render
by
courtney
b
.
vance
as
doc
--
in
a
role
that
will
have
many
flatly
disbelieve
that
this
be
same
actor
they
cheer
as
''
seaman
jone
''
in
mctiernan
's
red
October
.
if
you
have
see
private
ryan
,
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
see
hamburger
hill
--
if
only
to
determine
that
the
all
the
valor
and
horror
of
spielberg
's
vision
be
as
present
in
the
ashau
valley
as
it
be
at
omaha
beach
.
