in
many
way
,
''
twotg
''
do
for
tough-guy
movie
what
la
confidential
do
for
police
story
.
there
be
savviness
in
its
writing
and
a
mature
patience
in
allow
the
material
to
unfold
.
but
,
i
suppose
,
we
would
not
expect
less
from
christopher
mcquarrie
,
who
be
responsible
for
give
we
''
the
usual
suspect
''
.
he
write
talent
be
still
in
tact
as
he
bring
to
we
a
bloody
yet
intellectual
tale
of
two
unabashed
but
dimwitted
thug
and
a
plan
go
awry
.
the
two
goon
be
parker
and
longbaugh
-lrb-
ryan
phillipe
and
benicio
del
toro
-rrb-
.
these
two
man
show
the
harden
wear
of
those
who
have
always
have
it
tough
.
they
troubled
youth
have
forge
two
nihilistic
soul
who
use
they
amazing
gunplay
skill
to
survive
.
give
the
choice
of
minimum
wage
or
petty
crime
,
they
'll
always
choose
the
latter
.
yet
,
they
be
incredibly
foolish
planner
.
actually
,
these
two
never
really
have
a
plan
.
they
just
improvise
along
the
way
,
hope
that
they
bravado
and
arsenal
of
gun
will
take
care
of
anything
that
they
might
have
overlook
.
they
next
scheme
,
which
they
cook
up
about
as
fast
as
a
mcdonald
's
burger
,
be
to
kidnap
some
surrogate
mother
name
robin
-lrb-
juliette
lewi
-rrb-
that
be
hire
by
some
well-to-do
family
.
if
all
go
well
,
they
'll
receive
a
nice
bit
of
ransom
money
and
life
go
on
.
what
parker
and
longbaugh
do
not
realize
be
that
robin
be
carry
a
baby
for
the
chidduck
family
,
whose
patriarch
be
a
fear
crime
boss
.
moreover
,
two
bodyguard
-lrb-
nicky
katt
and
taye
digg
-rrb-
constantly
escort
she
.
these
two
protector
find
a
eerie
sense
of
pleasure
when
be
confront
and
test
in
life
and
death
situation
.
they
would
rather
die
than
fail
;
thus
they
bravado
level
be
equally
high
.
but
it
seem
that
the
testosterone
level
of
parker
and
longbaugh
be
a
bit
higher
,
and
they
employ
some
unusual
but
fun-to-watch
tactic
to
pull
off
the
kidnapping
and
to
outrun
the
pursuer
in
a
sort
of
slow-motion
car
chase
down
a
series
of
alleyway
.
the
next
hour
or
so
,
we
watch
the
chidduck
camp
regroup
and
assess
they
situation
.
during
this
time
,
additional
plot
line
come
into
play
and
more
and
more
detail
be
reveal
.
because
the
chidduck
's
can
not
go
to
the
police
and
because
of
the
special
circumstance
involve
the
kidnapping
,
we
be
introduce
to
more
character
that
will
help
to
influence
the
outcome
.
we
discover
that
not
everyone
in
the
chidduck
camp
be
loyal
to
the
cause
.
as
a
result
,
there
be
undercurrent
of
a
conspiracy
,
and
element
of
betrayal
and
subterfuge
.
the
sepia-toned
atmosphere
be
make
all
the
more
fascinating
thanks
to
a
terrific
soundtrack
which
emit
velvet
foreboding
,
shrill
of
intrigue
and
crescendo
that
tell
we
of
life
and
death
situation
that
be
about
to
occur
.
the
momentum
and
the
coolness
of
the
film
,
however
,
begin
to
fizzle
in
the
last
30
minute
,
which
feature
a
overly
extend
shootout
where
we
two
desperado
try
to
make
they
way
off
with
the
ransom
money
.
you
can
expect
lot
of
bloodlet
and
a
odd
denouement
.
in
fact
,
you
may
admire
this
film
more
than
you
like
it
.
yet
,
for
the
most
part
,
''
the
way
of
the
gun
''
stay
on
target
.
it
feel
cool
with
its
element
of
conspiracy
and
gunplay
,
and
smart
for
its
invective
dialogue
and
tough
guy
poetry
.
