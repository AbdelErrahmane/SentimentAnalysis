director
kathryn

know
she
stuff
and
do
not
hesitate
to
use
it
.
but
as
a
whole
,
this
be
a
unsatisfying
movie
.
the
problem
be
that
the
writer

jame
cameron
and
jay
cock
,
be
too
ambitious
,
aim
for
a
film
with
social
relevance
,
thrill
,
and
drama
.
not
that
ambitious
film-making
should
be
discourage
;
just
that
when
it
fail
to
achieve
its
goal
,
it
fail
badly
and
obviously
.
the
film
just
end
up
preachy
,
unexciting
and
uninvolving
.
