book
could
be
,
and
indeed
have
be
write
about
the
star
war
trilogy
,
and
rightfully
so
.
this
be
a
set
of
movie
that
shatter
all
expectation
of
what
science
fiction
could
be
in
the
late
70s\/early
80
,
inspiring
literally
dozen
of
clone
,
from
battlestar
galactica
all
the
way
up
to
stargate
and
independance
day
,
and
one
could
argue
revitalize
the
whole
science
fiction
genre
.
the
special
effect
be
groundbreak
,
revolutionary
for
they
day
and
still
eminently
watchable
well
into
twenty
year
later
.
literally
million
of
people
have
see
the
star
war
trilogy
and
be
touch
by
it
.
and
now
,
george
luca
bring
it
back
for
a
new
audience
to
enjoy
.
much
have
be
and
be
still
be
make
of
the
fact
that
mr
.
luca
have
go
back
and
revise
he
trilogy
for
rerelease
now
.
some
fan
be
angry
that
he
have
dare
to
meddle
with
what
they
consider
perfection
,
while
other
be
thrill
by
the
idea
of
see
yesterday
's
star
war
update
with
today
's
special
effect
wizardry
.
either
way
,
the
special
edition
release
mean
that
star
war
be
back
on
the
big
screen
,
where
it
rightfully
deserve
to
be
see
.
can
there
be
anyone
in
the
world
who
do
not
know
what
star
war
be
about
?
in
a
way
,
star
war
be
so
much
a
part
of
we
cultural
heritage
that
it
feel
silly
and
almost
artificial
to
try
to
summarize
it
.
it
be
a
story
about
a
young
man
's
come
of
age
,
a
fight
for
freedom
against
a
oppressive
empire
,
a
tale
of
swashbuckling
and
derring-do
the
likes
of
which
have
not
be
see
on
the
silver
screen
in
decade
,
strange
new
world
with
strange
alien
creature
and
weird
surprise
around
every
turn
,
and
the
yearning
within
each
of
we
to
realize
we
dream
and
make
a
difference
in
the
world
.
it
be
high
adventure
,
incredible
special
effect
,
and
...
well
,
it
be
just
a
_
experience
_
.
something
about
this
movie
spark
the
imagination
of
a
generation
...
and
it
be
about
to
do
so
again
.
this
new
release
of
star
war
come
as
no
surprise
to
many
of
the
film
's
devoted
fan
,
who

picture
of
before
and
after
have
be
place
side
by
side
...
even
month
before
the
movie
be
release
,
fan
be
make
comparison
.
in
some
case
,
the
change
be
nothing
less
than
phenomenal
,
and
this
can
be
see
from
the
comparison
shot
even
before
you
go
into
the
movie
theater
.
the
digital
matte
effect
that
be
little
more
than
a
toy
in
forrest
gump
be
put
to
excellent
use
here
,
unnoticeably
spruce
up
scene
that
that
george
luca
be
unsatisfied
with
in
the
original
.
for
instance
,
in
my
personal
favorite
example
,
the
ancient
temple
on
yavin
that
be
formerly
a
flat
stone
edifice
now
have
deep
,
moss-covered
carving
and
etching
.
and
mo
eisley
spaceport
be
now
a
bustling
,
booming
city
,
with
more
surprise
and
thing
go
on
in
the
background
than
you
can
notice
on
the
first
viewing
.
all
the
starship
and
fighter
be
now
computer-animated
,
get
rid
of
glitch
and
artifact
of
the
special
effect
process
use
when
the
film
be
originally
make
--
and
they
look
_
fantastic
_
.
four
and
a
half
minute
of
new
or
missing
footage
have
be
add
,
include
a
scene
with
jabba
the
hutt
that
have
originally
be
shelve
because
the
state
of
special
effect
in
1977
simply
could
not
do
it
justice
.
however
,
much
of
the
ten
million
dollar
that
be
spend
on
the
star
war
special
edition
restoration
go
into
restore
the
quality
of
the
film
itself
.
the
negative
,
badly
damage
by
the
ravages
of
time
,
be
brighten
and
return
to
they
original
splendor
.
the
audio
track
be
remix
and
reprocess
,
with
rework
sound
effect
by
effect
maven
ben
burtt
,
into
glorious
,
booming
,
theater-shaking
full-thx
dolby
digital
stereo
.
and
_
that
_
,
more
than
the
add
scene
or
new
special
effect
,
be
where
the
real
value
of
this
new
version
lie
.
it
be
really
true
what
they
say
in
the
commercial
:
star
war
lose
_
so
much
_
on
the
small
screen
.
even
letterbox
do
not
make
up
for
the
decrease
in
size
and
definition
.
in
regard
to
the
star
war
special
edition
,
and
to
the
other
two
film
of
the
trilogy
which
have
yet
to
be
release
,
i
'll
make
this
final
recommendation
:
go
and
see
it
.
go
and
see
it
more
than
once
...
it
may
be
another
twenty
year
before
it
come
back
to
the
big
screen
after
it
be
go
this
time
.
take
along
the
youngster
who
have
never
have
the
big-screen
star
war
experience
--
you
'll
enjoy
see
it
through
they
eye
as
much
as
they
will
enjoy
it
for
the
first
time
.
there
be
magic
in
this
movie
--
special
edition
or
no
,
there
can
be
no
deny
that
it
be
still
star
war
,
and
still
have
the
power
to
thrill
and
enthrall
child
of
all
age
,
from
four
to
four
hundred
.
let
's
all
return
to
that
time
long
ago
,
and
that
galaxy
far
,
far
away
...
