she
very
much
enjoy
where
she
career

often
not

seriously
by
she

,
who

always
give
she
petty
job
to
do
,
when
she
know
she
could

do
more
important

one
night
,
while
take
a
bath
,
syd
notice
a
leak
come
from
the
apartment
above
hers
,
so
when
she
go
up
there
to
inform

she
meet

out

syd
quickly
strike
up
a
conversation
with
lucy

and
discover
that
she
use
to
be
a
acclaimed
photographer
ten
year
before

lucy
start
a

''
be
such
a
effective
motion
picture
because
it
be
never
suger-coated
or
idealized
,
but
instead
a
honest
and
convincing
portrait
of
a
handful
of
unhappy
people
whose
life
be
go
nowhere
,
while
syd
's
luck
begin
to
rise
.
the
film
in
no
way
be
about
lesbianism
,
but
about
love
,
which
be
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
stereotypical
portrait
of
homosexuality
.
as
lucy
and
syd
grow
closer
and
closer
together
,
we
really
do
believe
that
they
be
fall
in
love
with
each
other
,
even
if
the
relationship
might
be
doom
.
with
this
picture
,
ally
sheedy
's
star
have
rise
once
again
,
thanks
to
she
touching
,
nearly
flawless
portrtayal
of
lucy
,
a
woman
who
,
in
the
course
of
a
decade
,
have
find
she
life
consume
almost
entirely
by
drug
,
which
have
take
away
she
once-blossoming
career
.
she
characted
really
be
tragic
,
and
one
particular
scene
involve
lucy
and
she
mother
,
in
which
lucy
admit
to
she
that
she
have
a
drug
problem
,
and
she
mother
matter-of-factly
respond
by
say
she
can
not
help
she
,
be
heartbreaking
.
although
not
autobiographical
,
sheedy
have
have
drug
problem
in
she
past
,
and
i
suspect
she
bring
that
knowledge
of
already
be
in
lucy
's
footstep
to
she
role
.
also
very
good
be
radha

i
wish
the

have
be
more
tightly

involve
syd
and
jame
,
who
,
play
by
gabriel

,
be
leave
with
a
throwaway
role
.
by
the
time
he
find
out
about
syd

lucy
,
he
disappear
from
the
film
,
and
i
wish
there
have
be
another
scene
where
they
confront
each

this
be
a
very
minor
fault
,
however
,
in
a
film
that
be
full
of
riches
.
although
many
of
the

syd

be
also
write
to
be

more
mature
than

and
the
one

scene
in
the

be
beautifully
and
originally
do

it
do
not
invlove
