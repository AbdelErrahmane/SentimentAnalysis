about
more
than

,
which
explain
why
the
bard
's
material
be
such
a
popular
source
for
remake

revision
,

,
inspiration
,
subtlety
,

indeed
,
in
recent

american
contemporary
cinema
have
be
swamp
with
a
wash
of
shakespearean
product
.
include
this
year
's
upcome
a
midsummer
night
's
dream
,
shakespeare
's
material
have
be
the
cause
for
twenty-six
big
screen
production
since
1990
.
but
for
a
change
of
pace
,
mr
.
brown
director
john
madden
give
we
a
story
of
the
bard
himself
in
the
wonderfully
vibrant
shakespeare
in
love
.
marc
norman
and
tom
stoppard
's
story
be
largely
fantasy
,
although
as
the
viewer
soon
learn
,
shakespeare
in
love
be
not
a
movie
that
take
itself
seriously
.
-lrb-
will
shakespeare
of
the
1590
's
would
have
be
marry
to
anne
hathaway
,
and
he
would
have
have
a
teenage
daughter
and
two
young
son
;
here
he
be
a
bachelor
play
by
joseph
fienne
.
-rrb-
will
be
a
writer
struggle
to
come
up
with
a
great
play
,
and
he
current
comedy
in
the
work
--
''
romeo
and
ethel
,
the
pirate
's
daughter
''
--
just
do
not
quite
seem
right
.
with
the
help
of
the
great
writer
christopher
marlowe
-lrb-
rupert
everett
-rrb-
,
and
the
inspiration
of
true
love
with
noblewoman
viola
de
lesseps
-lrb-
gwyneth
paltrow
-rrb-
,
he
change
thing
around
and
write
one
of
he
greatest
tragedy
,
''
romeo
and
juliet
.
''
the
love
story
between
will
and
viola
loosely
parallel
the
story
of
romeo
and
juliet
,
to
great
effect
.
fienne
and
paltrow
develop
a
sexy
chemistry
as
the
two
lover
which
give
the
movie
much
momentum
;
this
momentum
smoothe
out
the
bump
in
the
unfinished
and
largely
unsuccessful
comedy
.
the
support
role
be
well
fill
out
,
from
geoffrey
rush
as
will
's
worrisome
agent
,
philip
,
to
tom
wilkinson
as
the
producer
hugh
fennyman
.
even
ben
affleck
,
lead
the
troupe
of
actor
,
manage
to
make
a
favorable
impression
;
and
judus
dench
lend
some
brief
moment
of
screen
time
as
queen
elizabeth
i
.
gwyneth
paltrow
be
by
far
,
however
,
the
standout
of
the
lot
,
create
a
large
percentage
of
the
forementioned
vibrance
.
the
story
be
well-crafted
if
nothing
else
,
although
it
have
dangerous
moment
where
it
flirt
with
the
''
let
's
make
a
movie
''
-
genre
.
the
dialogue
be
breezy
and
lighthearted
,
and
certainly
accessible
by
the
audience
's
lowest
common
denominator
.
there
be
something
for
everyone
in
this
romantic
comedy
,
make
it
prime
date
flick
material
.
although
certainly
not
inspiring
in
any
regard
,
it
revel
in
a
wholesome
,
well-rounded
atmosphere
that
have
be
absent
in
many
of
1998
's
picture
;
the
true-love
story
be
one
of
the
best
around
.
certainly
recommendable
when
the
traditional
slew
of
indifferent
year
's
-
open
release
be
just
around
the
corner
.
