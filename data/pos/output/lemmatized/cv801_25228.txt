something
sacred
to
he
.
the
contrast
in
they
personality
be
stark
.
larry
be
all

,
he
simply
want
to
close

sale
.
he
come

.
he
criticize
phil

be
so
placid
,
for
get
such
a
small
suite
,
for

,
and
for
be
burned-out
.
he

for
too
long
.
he
now
find
himself
suffer
from
some
troubling
dream
and
question
what
he
believe
in
.
he
have
always
be
a
charmer
,
shake
everyone
's
hand
,
try
to
please
he
client
while
try
to
make
the
sale
.
larry
be
more
aggressive
as
a
salesman
,
he
be
always
a
heart
attack
away
from
every
big
sale
.
in
contrast
,
bob
be
only
in
he
twenty
and
everything
seem
fresh
to
he
.
this
be
he
first
time
for
he
on
the
road
.
when
dick
fuller
do
not
arrive
at
the
party
the
salesman
throw
,
larry
become
confrontational
and
ask
phil
if
he
speak
to
the
man
himself
about
the
gathering
.
when
tell
that
he
speak
to
the
secretary
,
larry
throw
a
tantrum
and
be
resign
to
go
back
to
they
home
office
without
the
new
account
.
but
when
they
start
talk
to
bob
,
whom
they
force
to
act
as
the
bartender
,
they
be
surprise
to
learn
that
fuller
do
indeed
come
but
be
wear
another
man
's
name
tag
and
that
bob
spend
the
entire
evening
console
the
tycoon
over
he
recently
decease
dog
and
then
talk
to
he
about
jesus
.
bob
then
tell
the
boy
about
a
private
party
fuller
be
attend
afterwards
,
and
that
he
invite
bob
to
attend
.
larry
and
phil
can
not
fathom
how
bob
do
not
make
a
sale
pitch
.
but
they
soon
take
another
tact
and
decide
to
prep
bob
on
how
to
get
fuller
's
attention
about
they
company
's
product
as
they
send
he
off
to
meet
fuller
,
and
will
await
he
return
in
the
hotel
room
.
these
two
sharp
salesman
be
reduce
to
wait
for
this
smug
kid
to
come
back
and
tell
they
he
save
they
ass
.
the
irony
of
they
situation
be
play
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
hotel
room
,
as
they
stay
up
late
into
the
night
try
to
make
sense
out
of
they
life
.
these
three
performer
be
outstanding
,
each
understand
what
they
role
call
for
,
each
come
through
with
a
marvelous
performance
.
the
only
problem
with
the
film
,
be
that
its
more
of
a
play
than
a
cinematic
experience
.
but
the
insightful
dialogue
and
refreshing
dramatics
,
give
it
a
intelligent
selling
point
and
make
it
a
good
product
to
see
.
