mcdonald
be
a
newcomer

a
promising
one
at
that

gleeson
have
be
in
over
a
dozen
movie

most
recently
as

a
very
irish

even
if

half
of
what
they
be
say
,
gleeson
and
mcdonald
together
make

i
go
down
''
a
trip
worth
take
.
the
film
be
in
many
way
reminiscent
of
another
''
little
''
independent
feature
,
1991
's
''
highway
61
.
''
that
film
,
too
,
be
a
road
movie
and
it
share
the
same
kind
of
wry
dialogue
and
humorous
situation
as
mcpherson
's
tale
:
whimsical
observation
on
life
,
carefully-crafted
vignette
,
deadpan
conversational
aside
,
and
scene
that
'll
make
you
laugh
out
loud
.
witness
the
episode
in
which
we
good-natured
protagonist
bind
frank
-lrb-
play
by
peter
caffrey
-rrb-
to
a
hotel
bed
,
leave
he
with
only
the
tv
remote
for
company
.
that
sequence
alone
be
on
a
par
with
satan
lock
himself
out
of
he
car
in
''
highway
61
.
''
what
be
also
charming
about
''
i
go
down
''
be
how
the
relationship
between
buddy
and
git
develop
.
they
trip
become
a
education
for
both
of
they
,
but
the
way
it
be
handle
be
neither
sappy
nor
labored
.
the
only
thing
in
the
film
which
approach
clunkiness
be
the
culminate
explanation
,
via
flashback
,
of
the
relationship
between
frank
and
tom
.
it
be
a
little
too
hollywood
,
and
what
make
''
i
go
down
''
so
refreshing
be
the
fact
that
it
rarely
pander
to
traditional
convention
of
hollywood
gangster
movie
.
sure
it
be
gritty
--
make
that
grubby
--
but
it
be
also
pretty
goofy
.
although
''
i
go
down
''
emphasize
the
comedic
element
of
dis-organized
crime
,
there
be
a
couple
of
fairly
brutal
scene
in
keep
with
the
subject
matter
.
do
not
let
these
deter
you
,
though
;
''
i
go
down
''
be
a
little
gem
.
it
be
only
playing
at
one
philadelphia-area
theater
--
and
i
suspect
it
will
not
be
there
for
long
--
so
catch
it
while
you
can
.
