the

could
go

have

the

the

best

because
the

it
be
one
thing
to
champion
the

it
be
another
to
see

-lrb-
it

-rrb-
he

one
could
argue
that
it

react
to
such
sexual
deviance
than

,
though
;
russell
disturb

no-nonsense
about

when

conjure
the
detonation

russell
mute
the
sound-we
be
pay
attention
to
the
debris
instead
of

stylistically
,
it
stand
apart
from

newton
thoma
sigel

cinematography
of

be
overexpose

extremely
grainy
,
which
be
,
of

,
entirely
appropriate
.
one
practically
break
out
in

stare
at
the

.
-lrb-
a
friend
enthusiastically
add
,
''
it
be
like
have
sand

.
''
-rrb-
this
also
help
to
blur
the
fact
that
the
actual
location
be
far
remove
from
the
persian
gulf
facade
.
-lrb-
three
king
be
shoot
in
arizona
,
californium
,
and

.
-rrb-
russell
throw
plenty
at
sigel
's
camera
for
it
to
observe-as
be
the
case
with
russell
's
previous
effort
,
the
most
absurd
moment
be
also
the
film
's
most
realistic
,
even
the
most
poignant
.
-lrb-
we
watch
a
bullet
puncture
a
organ
from
the
inside
.
-rrb-
if
anything
,
three
king
settle
down
and
stop
surprising
we
.
its
climax
be
pure
hollywood
,
no
doubt
the
answer
to
why
a
major
studio
feel
comfortable
get
into
bed
with
the
indie-minded
russell
.
subsequently
,
the
character
become
more
cartoonish-barlow
's
post-torture
revelry
feel
phony
,
and
chief
,
a
strong
presence
in
the

,
fail
to
escape
the
god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power
clich
?

so

notwithstanding
,
the
protagonist
be
very
intelligent
,
and
self-serving
,
too
;
i
have
a
glimmer
of
hope
,
base
on
russell
's
filmography
,
that
we
antihero
would
revert
to
they
greedy
self
at
some
juncture
.
-lrb-
it
be
not
spoil
much
to
write
that
.
-rrb-
then
again
,
what
historical
importance
would
such
nastiness
serve
?
-lrb-
there
be
already
enough
cynicism
in
the
film
's
mention
of
kuwait
's
oil-infested
water
.
-rrb-
russell
offer
the
mass
a
primer
on
the
oft-dismissed
gulf
conflict
,
and
pull
off
a
neat
trick
:
a
war
tale
full
of
battle
that
take
place
after
a
truce
have
be
declare
.
if
he
set
out
to
make

globally
significant

he
succeed

with
flair
