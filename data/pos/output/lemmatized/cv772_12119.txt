true
faith
and
its
expression
through
organize
religion
be
a
difficult
subject
for
a
motion
picture
to
tackle
head-on
,
which
be
probably
why
so
few
of
they
do
it
.
even
the
most
religious
director
-
like
martin
scorsese
or
ingmar
bergman
-
usually
address
issue
of
faith
in
implicit
rather
than
explicit
religious
term
.
so
it
be
not
hard
to
see
why
it
take
robert
duvall
fifteen
year
to
get
''
the
apostle
''
onto
the
big-screen
.
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
even
after
fifteen
year
he
still
never
manage
to
get
financial
backing
,
and
he
end
up
pay
for
it
with
$
5
million
of
he
own
money
.
he
also
write
the
script
,
direct
the
film
,
and
star
as
the
central
character
,
a
fiery
texa
preacher
name
euliss
''
sonny
''
dewey
.
few
filmmaker
have
the
courage
and
sheer
audacity
to
take
on
that
kind
of
financial
,
technical
,
and
creative
responsibility
single-handedly
,
and
it
be
testament
to
what
a
intensely
personal
project
this
be
for
duvall
.
and
,
thankfully
,
every
bit
of
that
personal
investment
translate
on-screen
into
power
and
honest
emotion
.
sonny
be
a
energetic
,
pentecostal
preacher
who
have
be
speak
-lrb-
actually
shout
-rrb-
from
behind
the
pulpit
since
he
be
twelve
.
he
spend
much
of
he
time
travel
about
the
country
,
evangelize
with
other
preacher
at
tent
revival
.
unlike
most
hollywood
characterization
of
intense
preacher
,
sonny
be
not
a
phony
or
a
swindler
,
and
the
film
's
purpose
be
not
to
unearth
hypocrisy
and
sin
in
either
sonny
or
the
church
.
duvall
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
sonny
truly
believe
in
what
he
say
,
although
like
all
human
,
he
have
weakness
.
one
of
he
weakness
become
apparent
when
he
find
out
that
,
not
only
do
he
long-suffering
wife
,
jessie

farrah
fawcett
-rrb-
,
want
to
leave
he
for
another
man
in
the
congregation

but
the
two

have
secretly

to
remove
he
as
preacher

face
with
the
loss
of
two
thing
he
love
passionately
-
he
church
and
he
family
-
that
same
raw
power
that
allow
sonny
to
get
entire
congregation

and
sway

into
a
violent
temper
.
at

son

baseball
game

sonny

and

lover
in
the
face

not

what

to

sonny

he
throw
away

,
drive
he
car
into
a
lake
,
and
take
a
bus
to
louisiana

to
start
over
again

in
the
tiny
,
mostly
poor
coastal
town

duvall
have
make
he
intention
in
make
''
the
apostle
''
clear
.
in
a
recent
article
in
''
newsweek
,
''
he
write
:
''
filmmaker
hardly
ever
depict
spirituality
with
such
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
holy
spirit
,
and
when
they
do
,
it
tend
to
be
patronize
-
full
of
charlatan
and
snake
handler
...
but
what
i
really
want
to
do
be
try
to
understand
what
these
preacher
go
through
and
what
they
believe
,
and
to
portray
it
in
a
accurate
way
.
''
the
strength
of
duvall
's
conviction
turn
out
to
be
the
strength
of
he
film
-
''
the
apostle
''
always
ring
true
,
even
in
the
most
painful
moment
,
because
we
know
he
be
be
sincere
with
the
subject
matter
.
after
fifteen
year
of
travel
the
country
,
listen
to
all
shape
and
size
of
minister
and
take
studious
note
on
what
they
say
,
duvall
have
capture
the
energy
and
vitality
of
what
it
mean
to
be
truly
spiritual
.
he
sonny
be
a
man
who
speak
directly
to
god
and
expect
to
be
speak
right
back
to
.
''
i
have
always
call
you
jesus
and
you
have
always
call
I
sonny
,
''
he
say
.
when
neighbor
call
and
complain
that
he
be
be
too
loud
one
night
in
one
he
rant
with
the
man
upstairs
,
sonny
's
mother
-lrb-
June
carter
cash
-rrb-
just
hang
up
on
they
because
she
know
there
be
no
sense
try
to
interrupt
he
.
the
main
theme
to
emerge
from
''
the
apostle
''
be
the
fact
that
good
can
come
from
any
situation
.
sonny
's
act
of
violence
toward
another
human
being
be
inarguably
a
horrific
thing
,
and
duvall
never
shrink
from
that
fact
.
however
,
that
very
same
act
of
violence
be
what
bring
sonny
to
bayou
boutte
,
where
he
find
people
whom
he
desperately
need
and
who
desperately
need
he
.
in
he
short
time
in
louisiana
,
he
do
a
world
of
good
,
and
when
the
police
finally
show
up
to
take
he
away
,
he
go
quietly
,
know
that
he
deserve
the
punishment
that
be
await
he
.
and
,
as
a
scene
during
the
final
credit
show
,
he
even
turn
he
punishment
into
a
positive
opportunity
for
change
and
betterment
.
it
be
that
strength
in
sonny
's
character
that
make
he
so
appealing
and
magnetic
to
other
-
he
be
flaw
,
but
he
be
powerful
enough
to
overcome
those
flaw
.
weak
man
be
the
one
who
simply
accept
they
weakness
and
lack
the
desire
to
better
themselves
.
watch
duvall
on-screen
,
it
be
not
hard
to
imagine
that
he
would
have
be
a
magnificent
preacher
if
he
have
choose
that
vocation
over
act
.
as
sonny
,
he
completely
inhabit
the
character
,
and
he
performance
be
certainly
the
best
of
the
year
.
because
he
spend
so
much
time
absorb
the
trait
,
method
,
quirk
,
and
personality
of
real
preacher
,
duvall
be
able
to
create
a
complete
character
who
always
feel
indelibly
human
.
as
a
director
,
duvall
feel
that
less
be
more
.
he
camera
simply
take
in
what
go
on
in
front
of
it
,
with
very
little
intrusion
.
there
be
no
fancy
crane
shot
or
extend
dolly
or
excessive
close-up
.
duvall
know
that
the
power
of
the
film
's
character
-lrb-
enhance
by
the
fact
that
he
cast
mostly
non-professional
churchgoer
and
actual
minister
-rrb-
do
not
need
to
be
artificially
enhance
.
in
this
way
,
''
the
apostle
''
almost
play
out
like
a
documentary
,
not
only
in
its
technical
simplicity
,
but
more
importantly
,
in
its
sense
of
reality
.
