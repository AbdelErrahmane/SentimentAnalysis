redford
again

redford
also
direct
the
film
although
he
swear
up
and
down
that
he
would
never
direct

in

i

the
character
of
tom
booker
,
a
man
who
have
the
amazing
gift
of
understanding
and
somehow
communicate
with

,
be

in
many
way
,
the
film
be
like
a
journey
,
both
literally
and
symbolically
.
the
move
out
west
have
always
be
a
great
american
tradition
of
renewal
,
and
it
be
hard
not
to
see
annie
and
grace
's
leave
manhattan
for
montana
as
a
variation
on
the
classic
theme
of

in

''
country
be
clearly
the
victor

the
city
be
characterize
by
claustrophobia
and
unhappiness
,
and
it
be
not
until
the
character
arrive
in
the
wide-open

that
grace
's

physically

annie

nature
begin
to

and

redford
be
just
as
in
love
with
the
grand
montana
country
in
this
film
as
he
be
when
he
direct
''
a

''
six
year
ago
.
in
many
way
,
''
the
horse
whisperer
''
come
from
the
same
poetic
vein
as
''
river
,
''
and
the
movie
could
probably
be
a
good
fifteen
minute
shorter
if
redford
have
decide
to
spend
less
camera-time
on
the
grass
and
mountain
.
but
then
,
that
would
ruin
the
magic
.
much
of
the
film
's
photography
be
truly
elegant
,
and
it
create
a
palpable
sense
of
the
sheer
expansiveness
of

.
although
''
the
horse
whisperer
''
have
a
strong
romantic
sensibility
,
i
still
find
something
oddly
trouble
about
this
kind
of
story
.
it
seem
to
I
that
there
should
be
some
sympathy
for
the
husband
who
be
be
leave
behind
for
this
brief
,
heart-sweeping
affair
,
but
there
rarely
be
.
in
''
the
horse
whisperer
,
''
the
thankless
role
of
be
the
fuddy-duddy
husband
fall
to
sam
neill
.
he
play
the
character
as
a
decent
,
hard-working
man
who
be
a
good
husband
and
father
;
he
only
failure
be
that
he
love
he
wife
more
than
she
love
he
.
he
be
at
risk
of
lose
annie
to
booker
not
because
he
do
anything
to
drive
she
away
,
but
simply
because
he
happen
to
be
a
normal
,
fairly
uninspiring
man
.
there
be
one
scene
that
be
particularly
tell
of
how
the
movie
feel
about
each
character
.
it
show
booker
and
robert
go
into
a
horse
pen
-
booker
be
dress
like
a
classic
cowboy
with
hat
and
all
,
while
robert
look
somewhat
frumpy
and
out-of-place
in
a
baseball
cap
.
as
they
enter
the
pen
,
booker
assuredly
swing
over
the
fence
,
while
robert
hesitate
,
then
open
the
gate
and
,
in
a
goofy
moment
,
forget
to
close
it
behind
he
.
it
be
a
small
scene
,
but
it
clearly
demonstrate
the
movie
's
thorough
love
of
the
booker
character
for
he
romantic
roughness
.
after
all
,
booker
represent
everything
good
about
the
city
while
robert
represent
everything
banal
and
unnatural
about
it
.
the
best
scene
in
''
the
horse
whisperer
''
tend
to
involve
not
the
building
romance
between
booker
and
annie
,
but
rather
the
healing
process
of
grace
and
she
horse
.
although
booker
's
horse-training
method
be
mythical
and
unrealistic
,
the
scene
with
he
and
pilgrim
be
strangely
mesmerizing
.
these
be
parallel
by
the
scene
between
he
and
grace
,
some
of
which
be
humorous
,
and
all
of
which
be
tender
and
true
.
at
some
point
,
i
wish
the
movie
would
drop
the
whole
romance
angle
and
focus
on
grace
more
.
nevertheless
,
redford
be
obviously
a
romantic
at
heart
,
and
he
bring
a
light
touch
to
the
erotic
moment
in
the
film
.
there
be
no
dramatic
sex
scene
,
but
there
be
a
move
scene
when
he
and
scott
thoma
be
slow-dancing
,
always
move
ever
closer
together
,
that
be
far
more
erotic
than
any
scene
of
sweaty
body
grind
together
.
although
the
movie
be
longer
than
it
should
be
and
be
essentially
a
melodramatic
tearjerker
with
a
unsatisfying
conclusion
that
guarantee
unhappiness
for
just
about
every
character
,
there
be
enough
moment
like
that
which
make
''
the
horse
whisperer
''
worth
the
price
of
admission
.
