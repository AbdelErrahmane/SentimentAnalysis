although
the
first
mission
:
impossible
film
be
a
moderate
box
office
success
,
audience
pan
it
because
they
feel
the
plot
be
too
confusing
and
there
be
not
much
action
-lrb-
although
be
a
fan
of
the
series
both
old
and
new
,
i
think
the
movie
be
pretty
decent
and
especially
gutsy
to
make
phelp
a
bad
guy
-rrb-
.
that
problem
have
be
rectify
in
the
sequel
by
make
the
plot
more
accessible
-lrb-
courtesy
of
one
of
the
writer
of
the
previous
entry
,
robert
towne
-rrb-
and
by
turn
the
film
into
one
gigantic
action
set
piece
under
the
steady
hand
of
action
film
guru
john
woo
.
the
end
result
be
one
of
the
most
entertaining
-lrb-
yet
simple
-rrb-
action
film
make
in
a
long
while
.
unfortunately
,
the
first
forty
minute
or
so
be
relatively
slow
,
dwelling
mainly
on
ethan
and
nyah
's
quickly
blossom
romance
and
seem
more
in
place
in
a
jame
bond
film
than
with
the
less
glamorous
mission
:
impossible
tv
series
.
ethan
's
conflict
be
a
compelling
one
,
but
it
seem
very
rush
-lrb-
and
come
about
because
of
a
near
fatal
car
wreck
that
ethan
himself
cause
!
-rrb-
.
john
woo
handle
all
of
this
with
a
artistic
flair
that
seem
out
of
place
,
feature
a
great
deal
of
slow
fade
and
dramatically
frame
close-up
.
the
surreal
nature
of
these
sequence
be
distract
and
ultimately
a
detriment
to
the
film
.
thankfully
though
,
at
the
point
ambrose
discover
nyah
's
deception
,
mission
:
impossible
ii
become
very
entertaining
and
action-packed
.
robert
towne
's
screenplay
take
some
of
the
convention
set
up
in
the
first
film
and
parody
they
during
a
sequence
where
ethan
must
break
into
a
high-rise
building
and
retrieve
the
remain
specimen
of
the
virus
.
after
that
,
the
action
scene
just
begin
to
build
in
intensity
,
as
be
the
case
with
many
of
woo
's
previous
high-octane
film
.
the
final
half
hour
be
a
all
out
assault
of
action
-lrb-
a
good
deal
of
which
be
ruin
by
the
trailer
,
unfortunately
-rrb-
.
as
far
as
summer
entertainment
go
,
mission
:
impossible
ii
be
serviceable
fare
.
anyone
look
for
hardcore
action
will
not
be
disappointed
-lrb-
except
for
during
the
first
half
of
the
film
,
perhaps
-rrb-
.
even
if
you
be
not
a
fan
of
the
first
film
,
this
entry
deserve
some
check
out
.
