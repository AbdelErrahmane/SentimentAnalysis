usually
when
a
blockbuster
come
out
,
it
be
load
with
effect
,
star
,
bad
script
,
and
plenty
of
action
.
mystery
man
may
contain
a
all-star
cast
,
and
efect
,
but
the
clever
script
and
character
be
what
really
work
,
which
be
rare
to
see
this
year
.
the
film
be
base
upon
the
comic
book
series
''
the
flaming
carrot
''
by
bob
burden
,
in
which
3
wanna
be
super
hero
try
and
fight
crime
,
only
to
be
out
do
by
the
real
hero
of
champion
city
,
captain
amazing
-lrb-
greg
kinnear
-rrb-
.
thing
go
a
little
haywire
,
when
the
sinister
casanova
frankenstein
-lrb-
geoffrey
rush
-rrb-
be
release
into
the
city
,
where
he
capture
captain
amazing
,
and
plan
to
wreak
havoc
upon
champion
city
.
well
,
the
trio
decide
to
take
matter
in
they
own
hand
,
by
save
the
city
,
but
first
they
need
some
assitance
.
this
be
where
the
film
take
a
turn
for
the
better
.
in
the
beggining
,
there
be
only
3
wanna
be
hero
.
''
blue
raja
-lrb-
hank
azarium
-rrb-
,
''
mr
.
furious
-lrb-
ben
stiller
-rrb-
and
''
the
shoveller
-lrb-
william
h
.
macy
-rrb-
.
sure
they
be
enteratain
,
but
they
act
grow
old
fast
.
that
be
until
they
aquire
''
invisible
boy
''
-lrb-
kel
mitchell
-rrb-
,
and
''
the
bowler
''
-lrb-
janeane
garafalo
-rrb-
and
''
mr
.
splein
''
-lrb-
paul
reuben
-rrb-
,
2
of
which
rescue
the
film
from
become
a
disastorous
mess
.
thankfully
,
the
original
3
hero
become
amusing
,
with
some
support
of
reuben
and
garfalo
on
screen
.
the
whole
premise
be
rather
ridiculous
,
but
pack
a
few
punch
to
keep
interest
.
for
one
,
the
film
be
considerably
clever
.
it
literally
poke
fun
at
super
hero
film
,
like
batman
and
robin
,
superman
etc
.
in
fact
,
many
scene
be
similar
to
batman
and
robin
,
include
the
opening
sequence
,
only
alter
in
a
humorous
and
superior
way
.
a
part
of
the
cleverness
come
from
the
cast
.
sometimes
a
film
with
such
talent
be
overblown
,
but
the
acting
be
what
keep
it
alive
here
.
while
azarium
and
macy
be
enteratine
,
2
character
really
stand
out
.
one
be
paul
reuben
.
no
matter
how
disgusting
or
revolting
''
mr
.
splein
''
may
be
,
you
still
can
not
help
but
laugh
.
it
'
so
incredibly
moronic
,
it
be
just
a
riot
watch
reuben
relieve
himself
of
bodily
function
.
janeane
garafalo
also
be
a
interesting
character
.
she
seem
to
be
the
most
outgoing
and
convincing
character
on
screem
,
due
to
she
enthusiasm
,
that
keep
the
film
flow
.
man
be
worth
see
alone
,
for
those
2
troubled
hero
.
on
the
downside
,
a
few
of
the
hero
and
especially
the
villain
never
really
lift
off
.
kel
mitchell
and
geoffrey
rush
,
be
both
utterly
useless
.
they
part
be
so
limited
,
they
would
be
lucky
at
all
to
be
on
screen
for
more
than
20
minute
.
ben
stiller
too
be
waste
,
mostly
because
of
he
unlikeable
power
and
dialogue
.
none
of
these
character
get
a
rise
out
of
anybody
,
but
happily
they
be
lose
in
the
charming
flow
of
the
film
.
as
far
as
the
budget
go
,
it
be
wisely
spend
on
the
cast
,
not
the
effect
.
while
the
set
design
and
action
all
look
nice
,
i
be
glad
there
be
a
seperate
aspect
,
that
the
film
focus
on
,
and
for
that
i
applaud
.
slow
at
time
,
and
rather
pointless
,
mystery
man
still
deliver
.
it
forget
about
money
make
,
because
it
be
not
likely
to
make
a
bundle
like
it
be
proceeder
,
and
that
be
what
work
.
stupid
?
maybe
,
but
for
once
i
be
not
disappoint
.
no
one
expect
a
intelligent
film
,
but
you
get
a
film
that
wit
capture
you
attention
and
make
you
forget
this
miserable
year
.
