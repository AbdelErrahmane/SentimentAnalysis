breath

as

in

I

a
masterfully
compose
film

the
direction
be
out
of
this

surely
the
type

that
can

,
be
also
astounding

this
be
the
most

graphic
film
i
have
ever
see

you

the
warning
you
see
be
justified
;
save
private

be
visually
as
disturbing
as
a

can
get
.
the
question
be
,
''
do
the
story
and
its
realism
justify
the
excessive
use
?
''
the
answer
from
my
point
of
view
be
''
no
''
.
braveheart
be
a
truly
gritty
,

,
one
would
imagine

many
in

theater
could
not
bear
to

and
it
be
a
shame
,
too
,
because
this
be
otherwise
by

one
of

standout
this

such

display
may
