at
one
point
during
brian
de
palma
's
crime
epic
scarface
,
the
radiant
michelle
pfeiffer
turn
to
a
ranting
al
pacino
and
pop
a
question
that
the
audience
have
no
doubt
be
want
to
ask
for
themselves
:
''
can
not
you
stop
say
`
fuck
'
all
the
time
?
''
fuck
good
question
,
that
.
it
may
not
be
a
honor
that
instill
the
filmmaker
with
pride
,
but
as
far
as
i
can
tell
oliver
stone
's
script
contain
the
say
expletitive
more
time
than
any
other
film
in
cinema
history
.
yet
it
would
be
a
shame
if
bad
language
be
all
de
palma
's
scarface
be
remember
for
,
because
this
be
a
damn
fine
gangstar
flick
.
the
overall
structure
be
similar
to
howard
hawk
'
1932
original
,
but
this
time
the
scene
have
switch
to
miamus
,
florida
and
we
anti-hero
's
choose
vice
be
cocaine
traffiking
.
pacino
,
sport
a
thick
cuban
accent
,
give
one
the
best
performance
of
he
career
-lrb-
golden
globe
nominate
-rrb-
as
tony
montana
,
a
cuban
refugee
with
a
criminal
past
who
flee
castro
and
come
to
america
to
live
the
american
dream
.
and
live
it
out
he
do
,
with
lashing
of
violence
,
abuse
,
murder
and
the
funny
white
powder
.
from
he
earliest
job
as
a
drug
runner
for
various
middleman
,
tony
montana
make
it
clear
to
everyone
he
meet
that
he
be
not
a
man
to
be
fuck
-lrb-
sorry
-rrb-
.
soon
he
be
the
king
of
the
cocaine
heap
,
but
he
hot
head
and
a
increasingly
out
of
control
drug
addiction
prove
he
undoing
.
''
never
do
you
own
stash
''
,
warn
one
character
early
in
the
film
.
as
sure
as
night
follow
day
,
the
emperor
of
miamus
eventually
fall
.
writer
oliver
stone
and
director
brian
de
palma
make
a
explosive
combination
here
.
stone
's
script
offer
solid
storytelling
and
some
fine
character
development
.
montana
be
fascinating
;
uneducated
but
calculate
,
a
straight
shooter
who
speak
from
the
heart
;
a
ambitious
,
violent
man
yet
one
with
a
conscience
.
a
man
fiercely
protective
of
he
beautiful
20
year
old
sister
,
not
want
she
to
be
suck
into
the
glitzy
,
dangerous
world
which
he
inhabit
.
pacino
be
dynamite
,
take
to
the
role
with
a
brooding
,
bristling
energy
which
in
he
more
recent
film
have
often
degenerate
into
just
simple
overracting
.
pfeiffer
also
register
strongly
as
the
gangstar
mole
with
no
inner
life
.
only
once
do
tony
express
real
affection
for
she
and
he
desire
to
have
child
,
and
even
then
you
sense
all
he
really
want
be
a
regular
screw
and
a
beautiful
object
to
show
off
to
he
friend
,
and
she
be
happy
to
oblige
.
this
be
not
as
meaty
a
role
for
pfieffer
as
sharon
stone
's
be
in
casino
,
but
its
a
effective
one
nonetheless
and
she
aquit
herself
well
.
as
director
,
de
palma
set
up
a
number
of
dramatic
scene
with
he
typical
stylistic
brauva
.
the
escalate
tension
he
create
in
various
mob
situation
-
a
drug
deal
go
wrong
,
a
assination
attempt
-
be
often
thrilling
,
and
in
this
respect
he
be
every
bit
the
equal
of
scorese
and
coppolum
.
where
he
differ
from
,
say
,
coppolum
's
godfather
trilogy
be
in
he
overall
treatment
.
coppolum
give
he
crime
saga
a
operatic
sweep
,
whereas
in
scarface
de
palma
opt
for
a
grittier
feel
.
and
it
perfectly
suit
the
material
.
the
only
major
botch
be
giorgio
moroder
's
mostly
crap
synthesier
score
.
it
be
just
not
right
,
and
unfortunately
compromise
the
impact
of
some
otherwise
good
scene
.
as
expect
,
scarface
be
very
violent
at
time
,
but
you
should
not
be
watch
gangster
movie
if
that
upset
you
.
at
over
two
and
a
half
hour
in
length
it
be
a
true
epic
,
and
if
you
be
a
fan
of
the
genre
you
'll
love
f
\*
\*
k-filled
minute
of
it
.
