usually
when
one
be
debate
who
the
modern
queen
of
the
romantic
comedy
be
they
will
bring
up
name
like
julium
robert
or
sandra
bullock
.
other
will
mention
meg
ryan
.
but
for
I
,
it
be
not
even
close
.
janeane
garofalo
be
not
only
the
queen
of
the
romantic
comedy
,
she
be
the
best
comic
actress
in
hollywood
right
now
.
and
it
be
a
good
thing
she
be
star
in
the
matchmaker
,
because
without
she
presence
the
movie
would
be
bland
,
unfunny
,
and
dull
.
garofalo
star
as
marcy
tizard
,
a
top
aide
to
boston
senator
john
mcglory
,
who
be
suffer
in
the
poll
.
in
a
attempt
to
capture
the
irish
vote
,
he
send
marcy
on
a
mission
to
a
small
irish
town
call
ballinagra
in
search
of
other
mcglory
's
that
never
move
to
america
.
unfortunately
for
marcy
,
she
visit
coincide
with
the
town
's
annual
matchmaking
festival
.
thing
get
off
to
a
rocky
start
for
marcy
though
.
she
have
no
hotel
reservation
-lrb-
for
no
rational
reason
-rrb-
and
the
tiny
confine
room
-lrb-
tired
old
cliche
'
-rrb-
she
have
to
stay
in
have
a
visitor
in
she
bathtub
.
he
name
be
sean
,
and
marcy
find
he
repugnant
at
first
,
so
you
can
obviously
tell
where
this
be
head
.
the
movie
run
into
a
few
roadblock
.
for
instance
,
the
story
be
very
thin
.
none
of
the
character
-lrb-
except
the
old
local
matchmaker
-rrb-
be
nearly
as
interesting
as
garofalo
.
some
of
the
character
,
like
the
political
aide
play
by
deni
leary
,
have
wander
in
from
a
completely
different
movie
.
i
think
the
director
realize
this
and
decide
to
throw
in
numerous
shot
of
the
beautiful
irish
scenery
,
and
several
close-up
of
garofalo
's
win
smile
.
the
strange
thing
be
that
it
work
.
garofalo
's
charm
and
the
irish
scenery
could
carry
the
thinnest
of
story
,
and
it
carry
this
one
.
