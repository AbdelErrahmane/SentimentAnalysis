when
i
see
the
trailer
for
this
film
,
i
laugh
harder
than
i
have
in
quite
some
time
.
while
i
be
therefore
pretty
well
psyched
to
see
it
,
i
be
ever
mindful
that
a
trailer
can
make
even
the
most
mediocre
film
look
good
.
i
be
happy
to
say
that
there
be
something
about
mary
be
not
one
of
those
trailer
let-downs
.
in
fact
,
watch
this
film
be
quite
a
fine
way
to
spend
two
hour
.
the
film
open
up
in
flashback
to
1985
,
at
a
high
school
in
cumberland
,
rhode
island
.
ted
stroehmann
-lrb-
ben
stiller
-rrb-
be
a
social
reject
who
can
not
seem
to
get
a
date
to
the
upcoming
prom
,
until
he
come
to
the
defense
of
the
mentally
retarded
warren
-lrb-
w
.
earl
brown
-rrb-
,
who
be
be
harass
by
one
of
the
school
jock
.
it
seem
warren
's
sister
be
the
campus
queen
,
mary
jensen
-lrb-
cameron
diaz
-rrb-
,
who
be
impressed
with
ted
's
willingness
to
stand
up
for
she
defenseless
brother
,
despite
a
very
real
chance
of
get
beat
up
.
mary
take
a
immediate
liking
to
ted
and
ask
he
to
the
prom
.
ted
be
just
flatter
that
she
even
know
he
name
.
unfortunately
,
prom
night
be
ruin
when
ted
have
a
accident
with
he
zipper
-lrb-
at
which
every
man
in
the
theater
will
wince
-rrb-
,
and
be
send
to
the
hospital
.
fast
forward
to
the
present
,
where
ted
have
clean
himself
up
,
now
write
for
a
magazine
,
but
have
weekly
therapy
session
in
order
to
deal
with
he
obsession
of
the
past
13
year
:
mary
,
whom
he
have
not
see
since
that
fateful
day
.
with
the
help
of
he
friend
dom
-lrb-
chri
elliott
-rrb-
,
ted
hire
slimy
private
investigator
pat
healy
-lrb-
matt
dillon
-rrb-
to
track
down
he
only
love
.
however
,
when
pat
find
mary
,
he
fall
for
she
too
,
and
soon
the
both
of
they
be
compete
for
she
affection
.
there
be
something
about
mary
be
direct
by
bobby
and
peter
farrelly
,
who
bring
we
dumb
and
dumber
and
kingpin
.
not
exactly
intelligent
comedy
,
they
be
of
the
guilty
pleasure
variety
where
you
might
not
want
you
friend
or
co-worker
to
think
you
have
such
a
great
time
watch
they
.
with
they
current
film
,
the
farrelly
brother
have
come
up
with
something
you
'll
not
only
enjoy
,
but
also
will
not
mind
talk
about
the
next
day
at
the
water
cooler
.
the
film
succeed
in
employ
a
pretty
wide
range
of
comedic
style
,
from
the
subtle
to
the
ridiculous
,
and
while
a
few
of
the
gag
might
be
offensive
to
some
-lrb-
seem
like
residual
from
the
farrelly
brother
'
last
two
film
-rrb-
they
almost
all
work
.
i
have
not
see
many
movie
in
the
recent
past
that
shoot
for
the
mark
and
so
often
hit
it
dead
on
.
one
minute
you
'll
be
laugh
at
something
ted
say
,
and
the
next
you
'll
be
howl
at
the
sight
of
a
dog
drag
he
across
the
floor
of
mary
's
apartment
.
one
of
the
great
thing
this
film
have
go
for
it
be
ben
stiller
.
he
be
perfectly
cast
in
the
role
of
ted
,
because
he
be
a
guy
who
just
look
awkward
in
almost
every
situation
.
ted
's
a
nice
fellow
and
try
to
do
he
best
,
but
for
some
reason
or
another
thing
just
do
not
always
work
out
.
it
be
comical
,
but
also
have
that
kind
of
appeal
where
you
really
feel
for
the
he
and
want
he
to
come
out
on
top
.
actually
,
i
have
like
stiller
since
he
do
a
short
which
air
on
Saturday
night
live
back
in
the
mid-eighty
.
the
film
be
like
a
theatrical
trailer
for
a
spoof
on
the
tom
cruise\/paul
newman
film
the
color
of
money
,
entitle
the
hustler
of
money
.
in
it
,
stiller
play
wince
-lrb-
not
vince
-rrb-
who
be
take
under
the
wing
of
a
older
man
-lrb-
play
by
john
mahoney
-rrb-
to
become
a
big-time
bowling
hustler
.
it
be
parody
at
its
finest
,
more
of
which
show
up
in
the
short-lived
''
the
ben
stiller
show
''
on
the
fox
network
in
late
'
92\/early
'93
.
like
''
the
critic
''
-lrb-
which
air
on
abc
,
then
fox
-rrb-
,
i
still
mourn
that
show
's
cancellation
.
cameron
diaz
be
absolutely
enchant
for
most
of
the
film
,
although
she
character
seem
obsess
with
perfection
in
the
man
she
date
,
and
some
of
the
quality
she
look
for
make
mary
look
paper-thin
at
time
.
however
,
diaz
pull
the
role
off
with
such
panache
and
charm
,
that
you
can
still
see
why
she
be
get
guy
just
fall
over
each
other
to
be
with
she
.
heck
,
i
even
find
she
laugh
to
be
cute
,
even
though
i
think
it
be
annoy
during
a
appearance
she
make
on
the
tonight
show
last
week
.
my
girlfriend
remark
that
matt
dillon
do
not
change
,
and
you
know
,
it
be
really
true
.
he
and
ralph
macchio
must
hang
out
or
something
.
maybe
they
live
in
dick
clark
's
pool
house
.
anyway
,
here
's
another
good
piece
of
casting
,
as
dillon
slip
beautifully
into
the
role
of
the
guy
who
try
to
worm
he
way
into
mary
's
heart
.
the
support
performance
be
also
good
.
chri
elliott
have
a
bigger
part
than
in
the
abyss
-lrb-
yes
,
check
it
out
next
time
-rrb-
,
and
less
annoying
than
in
cabin
boy
.
lin
sha
,
who
play
mary
's
neighbor
magda
-lrb-
and
also
appear
as
the
landlady
in
kingpin
-rrb-
,
provide
some
good
laugh
,
especially
in
scene
with
she
benji-like
dog
,
which
act
as
the
focal
point
for
a
few
of
the
funniest
moment
of
the
film
.
lee
evan
,
as
mary
's
friend
tucker
,
display
a
flexibility
in
act
and
accent
which
surprise
and
contribute
to
a
interesting
plot
twist
.
the
farrelly
brother
and
scriptwriter
ed
decter
and
john
j
.
strauss
keep
the
comedic
pacing
go
so
that
there
be
not
any
noticeable
time
where
the
film
drag
.
the
only
problem
i
saw
be
they
use
of
a
couple
of
musician
who
provide
segue
between
several
key
scene
.
they
appear
out
of
nowhere
and
actually
sing
plot-relevant
information
right
toward
the
camera
.
it
be
a
device
which
be
amusing
for
about
three
seconds
when
they
open
the
film
.
after
that
it
get
a
little
annoying
,
and
it
be
unfortunate
that
those
spot
interrupt
what
would
otherwise
be
a
smooth
flow
.
fortunately
,
fill
with
sight
gag
,
humorous
line
,
and
solid
comedic
acting
,
there
be
something
about
mary
will
still
have
you
laugh
after
you
leave
the
theater
.
