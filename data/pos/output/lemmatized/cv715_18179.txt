the
happy
bastard
's
quickie
review
:
i
must
admit
,
no
doubt
's
single
''
new
''
be
quite
catchy
.
it
be
bouncy
and
energetic
enough
to
get
I
to
go
see
this
new
film
from
director
doug
limon
,
the
man
who
have
bring
we
the
humorous
swinger
a
little
while
back
.
the
result
?
a
movie
that
be
just
as
good
as
that
song
,
really
.
it
follow
the
life
of
several
individual
over
the
course
of
one
weekend
.
first
we
hear
about
a
grocery
bagger
-lrb-
sara
polley
-rrb-
who
run
into
a
monetary
situation
problem
and
end
up
sell
bogus
drug
at
a
rave
-lrb-
with
bad
result
,
as
a
drug
dealer
feel
he
be
be
swindle
by
she
-rrb-
;
then
come
the
story
of
a
english
grocery
store
worker
-lrb-
same
store
-rrb-
who
head
to
vega
for
the
weekend
with
friend
,
where
sex
,
gunplay
,
and
steal
car
trouble
come
into
play
;
then
we
see
the
story
of
two
gay
movie
actor
-lrb-
play
by
scott
wolf
and
jay
mohr
-rrb-
who
deal
with
a
cop
's
strange
insurance
presentation
and
hit
a
girl
-lrb-
sara
-rrb-
with
they
car
;
and
,
finally
,
we
come
to
another
grocery
worker
-lrb-
katie
holme
-rrb-
who
have
a
strange
fascination
with
say
drug
dealer
-lrb-
the
one
mention
earlier
-rrb-
.
really
,
it
be
all
confuse
to
keep
track
of
in
review
format
,
you
best
bet
be
to
just
,
well
,
go
.
the
movie
feature
some
very
good
act
from
all
angle
,
and
limon
add
the
same
humorous
energy
he
have
with
swinger
to
this
particular
product
.
the
dialogue
be
pretty
snappy
and
the
resolution
be
pretty
well
realize
,
not
go
for
the
sappy
happy
end
nor
the
dreaded
bad
ending
.
think
of
it
as
a
,
well
,
end
.
the
intertwining
of
story
be
a
particularly
good
element
to
the
movie
,
as
it
be
never
really
confusing
and
tell
different
side
of
the
story
,
like
slide
door
kinda
do
.
however
,
it
be
better
suit
for
the
younger
generation
who
want
a
little
spice
in
they
flick
,
which
slide
door
kinda
be
not
.
