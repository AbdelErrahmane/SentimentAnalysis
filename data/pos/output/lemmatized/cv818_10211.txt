it
have
be
three
long
year
since
quentin
tarantino
stun
the
cinema
world
by
claim
the
canne
film
festival
's
palme
d'or
,
a
$
100
million-plus
box
office
gross
,
and
a
oscar
nomination
?
all
for
he
sophomore
outing
,
pulp
fiction
.
since
then
,
the
talented
film
maker
have
be
virtually
invisible
,
surface
briefly
as
a
co-director
of
the
wildly
uneven
four
room
and
the
screenwriter
of
the
gory
vampire-fest
,
from
dusk
till
dawn
.
in
between
,
he
have
moonlight
as
a
''
actor
''
with
several
decidedly
unmemorable
performance
.
now
,
with
much
fanfare
and
anticipation
,
tarantino
have
return
with
he
third
directorial
effort
,
jackie
brown
.
and
,
while
this
motion
picture
,
adapt
from
elmore
leonard
's
novel
,
rum
punch
,
offer
solid
entertainment
,
those
expect
another
bravura
outing
from
tarantino
will
leave
theater
disappoint
.
for
the
most
part
,
jackie
brown
be
a
pretty
ordinary
crime
movie
.
the
story
,
which
start
out
slowly
,
develop
into
a
twisty
affair
,
with
double-cross
and
triple-cross
.
and
the
movie
be
litter
with
occasional
tarantino
trademark
:
witty
dialogue
,
unexpected
gunfire
,
'70s
pop
tune
,
and
close-up
of
women
'
bare
foot
.
yet
,
for
all
of
that
,
the
production
be
something
of
a
letdown
.
the
sheer
,
in-your-face
exuberance
that
mark
reservoir
dog
and
especially
pulp
fiction
be
absent
.
the
mostly-straightforward
chronology
of
jackie
brown
do
not
match
up
favorably
to
the
non-linear
style
of
tarantino
's
previous
effort
?
a
approach
that
add
tension
and
edginess
to
the
narrative
.
and
there
be
not
nearly
as
many
deliciously
offbeat
conversation
this
time
around
.
there
be
a
samuel
l
.
jackson
monologue
about
gun
,
a
jackson\/chris
tucker
argument
regard
the
merit
of
hide
in
a
car
trunk
,
and
a
jackson\/robert
de
niro
exchange
that
recall
some
of
the
jackson\/travolta
material
from
pulp
fiction
,
but
that
be
about
it
.
jackie
brown
's
lone
''
innovation
''
be
its
presentation
of
a
crucial
sequence
from
three
different
perspective
.
this
be
not
exactly
a
original
technique
?
it
have
be
do
numerous
time
before
,
most
famously
in
akira
kurosawa
's
rashomon
and
most
recently
in
edward
zwick
's
courage
under
fire
.
however
,
while
in
those
two
movie
-lrb-
and
other
-rrb-
,
there
be
a
legitimate
plot
reason
for
the
multiple
points-of
-
view
,
tarantino
's
sole
purpose
for
use
it
appear
to
be
because
it
be
unconventional
.
have
the
scene
in
question
be
show
from
only
one
of
the
three
vantage
,
nothing
would
have
be
lose
.
as
a
result
,
this
aspect
of
the
film
be
little
more
than
a
curiosity
.
for
the
second
picture
in
a
row
,
tarantino
be
attempt
to
revive
the
career
of
a
'70s
icon
.
this
time
around
,
instead
of
john
travolta
,
it
be
blaxploitation
queen
pam
grier
-lrb-
foxy
brown
have
become
jackie
brown
-rrb-
.
in
one
of
many
nod
to
the
most
famous
segment
of
grier
's
career
,
tarantino
use
a
'70s
song
to
accompany
she
first
appearance
during
the
opening
credit
.
there
be
also
several
instance
during
jackie
brown
when
the
director
offer
a
sly
wink
towards
certain
convention
of
the
blaxploitation
genre
-lrb-
although
grier
never
do
any
butt-kicking
-rrb-
.
grier
be
jackie
brown
,
a
flight
attendant
who
get
catch
transport
drug
and
money
into
the
united
state
.
she
be
work
for
gun
dealer
ordell
robbie
-lrb-
samuel
l
.
jackson
-rrb-
,
but
she
keep
she
mouth
shut
under
question
,
despite
pressure
from
ray
nicolet
-lrb-
michael
keaton
-rrb-
,
a
federal
official
.
no
longer
sure
whether
or
not
he
can
trust
jackie
,
ordell
arrange
for
a
bail
bondsman
,
max
cherry
-lrb-
robert
forster
,
tv
's
''
banyon
''
-rrb-
to
post
the
necessary
$
10
,
000
,
then
plan
to
shoot
jackie
if
she
prove
disloyal
.
jackie
pass
ordell
's
test
,
however
,
and
soon
the
two
of
they
be
plot
a
way
to
smuggle
$
500
,
000
of
ordell
's
money
into
the
united
state
without
tip
off
the
fed
.
soon
,
just
about
everyone
be
after
that
money
,
include
jackie
,
max
,
ray
,
ordell
's
perpetually
oversexed
and
drugged-out
girlfriend
,
melanie
-lrb-
bridget
fonda
-rrb-
,
and
he
right-hand
man
,
loui
-lrb-
robert
de
niro
-rrb-
.
unsurprisingly
,
the
most
memorable
performance
be
turn
in
by
samuel
l
.
jackson
,
but
ordell
be
not
nearly
as
invigorating
or
compelling
a
character
as
jule
from
pulp
fiction
.
in
addition
to
look
fantastic
,
pam
grier
be
also
quite
good
,
although
hers
be
not
a
oscar
-
caliber
performance
-lrb-
although
she
might
get
a
nomination
-rrb-
.
robert
forster
and
michael
keaton
be
solid
in
they
tough-guys-who-rarely
-
smile
role
.
bridget
fonda
be
around
for
three
discernible
reason
:
to
look
sexy
in
a
bikini
,
to
provide
a
little
twisted
comedy
,
and
to
satisfy
tarantino
's
foot
fetish
.
robert
de
niro
be
criminally
underused
in
a
part
that
could
have
be
play
equally
well
by
any
grungy
-
look
,
middle-aged
actor
.
the
film
,
which
clock
in
at
several
minute
over
the
two-and-a
-
half
hour
mark
,
be
probably
too
long
for
the
material
,
but
the
plot
be
convoluted
enough
to
keep
we
guess
throughout
-lrb-
although
the
payoff
be
a
letdown
-rrb-
.
tarantino
keep
thing
move
along
nicely
,
with
a
heavier
dose
of
humor
and
less
violence
than
in
pulp
fiction
,
but
,
on
the
whole
,
this
movie
seem
more
like
the
work
of
one
of
he
wannabe
than
something
from
the
director
himself
.
when
it
come
to
recent
caper
film
-lrb-
like
the
grifter
and
bind
-rrb-
,
jackie
brown
be
a
second-tier
effort
.
it
be
a
entertaining
diversion
,
but
not
a
masterpiece
,
and
certainly
not
a
oscar
contender
.
