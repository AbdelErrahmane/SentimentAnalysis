every
once
in
a
while
,
when
a
exceptional
family
film
come
along
,
i
will
attempt
to
champion
it
by
challenge
parent
to
put
they
money
where
they
mouth
have
be
;
with
all
the
hubbub
over
the
lack
of
film
suitable
for
child
,
it
be
remarkable
how
many
non-disney
film
disappear
in
a
couple
of
week
.
now
i
see
that
in
so
do
,
i
have
unfairly
ghettoize
these
film
.
so
i
be
issue
my
challenge
not
just
to
parent
,
but
to
anyone
who
want
to
support
smart
,
funny
,
energetic
film-making
:
see
matilda
.
see
it
in
a
theater
,
rather
than
shrug
and
wait
for
it
on
video
.
see
the
best
film
i
have
see
in
1996
.
not
the
best
child
's
film
...
the
best
film
.
period
.
base
on
a
story
by
roald
dahl
,
it
tell
of
young
matilda
wormwood
-lrb-
mara
wilson
-rrb-
,
a
extraordinarily
bright
girl
whose
great
misfortune
it
be
to
have
a
pair
of
deeply
stupid
parent
:
harry
-lrb-
danny
devito
-rrb-
,
a
crooked
used
car
salesman
;
and
zinnia
-lrb-
rhea
perlman
-rrb-
,
a
simple-minded
bingo
addict
.
the
wormwood
barely
notice
matilda
exist
,
and
when
they
do
,
it
be
only
to
scold
she
for
spend
too
much
time
read
book
.
when
they
finally
do
send
she
to
school
,
it
be
to
crunchem
hall
,
a
bleak
place
run
by
cruel
,
child-hating
miss
agatha
trunchbull
-lrb-
pam
ferris
-rrb-
.
but
thing
begin
to
look
up
for
matilda
when
she
discover
a
sympathetic
teacher
,
miss
honey
-lrb-
embeth
davidtz
-rrb-
,
who
nurture
she
natural
inquisitiveness
.
matilda
also
discover
another
special
talent
--
the
ability
to
move
thing
with
she
mind
--
which
allow
she
to
help
herself
and
miss
honey
to
overcome
miss
trunchbull
's
cruelty
.
it
be
this
spring
's
jame
and
the
giant
peach
which
inspire
I
to
note
that
the
best
and
most
lasting
tale
for
child
tend
to
have
more
than
a
hint
of
darkness
to
they
,
and
you
can
bet
that
the
roald
dahl
responsible
for
the
gleeful
ghoulishness
of
jame
and
willy
wonka
and
the
chocolate
factory
have
more
of
the
same
in
store
with
matilda
.
and
just
as
jame
benefit
from
the
dark
sensibility
of
henry
selick
and
tim
burton
,
matilda
soar
on
the
cock-eyed
direction
of
danny
devito
.
devito
make
black
humor
a
key
element
in
throw
momma
from
the
train
and
the
war
of
the
rose
,
and
he
contribute
some
memorable
image
.
in
one
scene
,
a
unfortunate
girl
be
make
a
example
of
by
miss
trunchbull
when
she
be
pick
up
by
she
pig-tail
and
fling
through
the
air
like
a
throw
hammer
;
later
,
a
overweight
boy
be
force
to
eat
a
entire
massive
cake
after
he
be
catch
steal
a
dessert
.
matilda
be
just
twist
enough
to
be
a
perfect
fairy
tale
.
it
be
also
characteristic
of
the
best
child
's
tale
that
they
manage
to
teach
lesson
in
such
a
way
that
child
almost
do
not
realize
that
they
be
learn
they
.
there
be
a
hilarious
moment
when
matilda
's
television-addicted
father
snatch
away
the
book
she
be
read
-lrb-
in
a
wicked
joke
,
he
think
_
moby
dick
_
be
pornographic
-rrb-
and
force
she
to
watch
a
inane
game
show
-lrb-
host
by
jon
lovitz
-rrb-
in
which
contestant
be
smear
with
adhesive
and
place
in
a
booth
fill
with
cash
blow
around
.
matilda
be
a
story
which
promote
the
value
of
intellectual
curiosity
over
passive
entertainment
,
and
it
do
so
while
poke
hole
in
that
most
frustrating
of
notion
for
a
child
--
that
because
''
i
be
big
and
you
be
little
,
i
be
right
and
you
be
wrong
.
''
more
specifically
,
it
have
as
its
heroine
a
intelligent
,
self-confident
girl
who
struggle
successfully
against
other
people
's
notion
of
how
she
should
behave
.
it
be
no
coincidence
that
matilda
be
co-write
by
robin
swicord
,
who
contribute
the
superb
recent
adaptation
of
little
woman
.
finally
,
matilda
have
that
quality
i
find
rarest
and
most
treasured
in
family
entertainment
:
it
be
family
entertainment
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
.
devito
know
enough
to
make
matilda
fast-paced
and
appealing
to
child
,
take
a
deliciously
nasty
performance
by
pam
ferris
as
miss
trunchbull
and
make
it
the
focal
point
of
some
priceless
physical
comedy
,
include
a
great
chase
through
she
dark
house
.
the
child
actor
be
win
but
never
obnoxiously
adorable
,
with
mara
wilson
make
matilda
a
clever
and
extremely
likeable
character
.
but
there
be
also
many
,
many
delight
for
adult
,
include
my
favorite
scene
in
which
matilda
use
she
power
to
frighten
miss
trunchbull
by
have
chalk
write
on
a
chalkboard
by
itself
while
matilda
's
classmate
recite
in
sing-song
fashion
;
there
be
also
a
deadpan
cameo
by
paul
reuben
as
a
fbus
agent
stake
out
matilda
's
father
.
i
can
not
imagine
anyone
of
any
age
leave
matilda
feeling
as
though
he
or
she
intelligence
have
be
insult
.
matilda
be
a
film
which
leave
I
glowing
with
good
feeling
.
i
will
see
it
again
,
and
year
from
now
i
will
watch
it
with
my
child
.
and
now
i
will
stop
,
because
somewhere
near
you
matilda
be
about
to
begin
,
and
there
be
a
seat
in
that
theater
you
should
be
in
,
if
you
have
a
child
or
ever
be
a
child
.
