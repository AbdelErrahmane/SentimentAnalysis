borrow
from
chri
wessell
-rrb-
.
when
it
come
to
modern
gangster
movie
,
it
be
really
difficult
to
describe
and
review
they
without
make
comparison
to
other
film
of
the
genre
and\/or
just
use
the
word
''
routine
.
''
i
have
always
subscribe
to
the
philosophy
that
any
idea
-lrb-
no
matter
how
many
time
it
be
be
use
before
-rrb-
can
provide
for
a
good
story
and
''
donnie
brasco
''
clinch
this
idea
.
it
be
not
unlike
most
of
the
great
film
of
the
genre
,
yet
it
never
ape
another
's
style
as
it
have
a
good
layer
of
authenticity
,
even
if
its
core
be
a
tad
stale
.
the
film
start
off
in
typical
fashion
by
define
its
atmosphere
of
new
york
city
in
the
late
1970
and
the
mobster
who
inhibit
it
.
we
meet
lefty
-lrb-
pacino
-rrb-
,
a
aging
wiseguy
who
can
still
walk
the
walk
and
talk
the
talk
.
he
and
he
associate
go
through
the
generic
motion
you
expect
to
see
in
crime
film
like
this
.
somehow
he
come
across
donnie
brasco
-lrb-
depp
-rrb-
,
a
younger
guy
with
a
lot
of
spunk
who
be
not
afraid
of
lefty
and
he
rep
,
and
even
manage
to
befriend
he
after
lefty
be
ready
to
kill
he
.
it
be
clear
donnie
be
new
to
the
life
and
lefty
recognize
this
immediately
,
tell
he
all
the
trick
of
the
trade
.
i
have
never
see
this
technique
of
actually
reveal
the
mafioso
idiosyncrasy
do
before
and
for
this
the
film
deserve
credit
.
however
,
we
soon
realize
donnie
be
actually
joe
pistone
,
a
fbus
agent
work
undercover
-
a
character
who
symbolize
the
viewer
as
he
will
soon
be
purge
into
the
lifestyle
and
treat
as
a
newcomer
.
the
first
act
work
as
a
guide
to
ot
of
rhetoric
about
wiseguy
honor
,
a
brief
history
of
the
mob
,
definition
of
they
slang
,
and
where
they
money
come
from
and
who
it
go
to
.
the
screenplay
be
rather
sketchy
on
the
detail
surround
these
element
,
however
,
the
fact
they
be
mention
at
all
be
quite
original
.
most
gangster
movie
seem
to
be
make
with
the
notion
the
viewer
already
know
how
the
mob
work
-lrb-
probably
from
watch
other
gangster
movie
-rrb-
,
and
although
this
attitude
come
across
,
the
film
try
to
fill
in
all
the
hole
where
and
when
it
can
and
the
effort
be
appreciable
.
thankfully
the
film
do
not
become
too
catch
up
in
the
tedious
detail
of
organized
crime
,
and
instead
opt
for
character
development
.
much
of
the
story
be
tell
simply
through
the
interaction
between
lefty
and
donnie
.
pacino
be
outstanding
here
as
the
pathetic
hood
who
speak
of
he
job
in
the
same
manner
any
blue
collar
worker
would
.
he
be
old
and
exhaust
but
seem
to
enjoy
what
he
do
,
just
as
anyone
loyal
to
the
same
employer
for
over
30
year
might
be
.
we
learn
of
he
accomplishment
,
which
be
quite
impressive
within
they
context
,
and
when
he
complain
about
not
be
make
top
boss
,
it
be
easy
to
sympathize
with
he
.
newell
constantly
play
up
this
aspect
,
make
it
a
major
theme
which
work
well
in
the
long
run
.
as
donnie
be
constantly
impress
and
even
one-upping
lefty
,
it
be
hard
to
tell
which
emotion
be
more
powerful
:
the
fact
donnie
be
get
closer
to
nail
the
mob
;
or
the
fact
lefty
have
once
again
be
over
shadow
.
most
of
the
film
tell
the
story
of
donnie
's
life
in
mafia
,
which
create
for
many
sub-plot
and
individual
conflict
,
but
do
not
always
seem
to
come
together
as
a
whole
.
the
storytelling
be
genuinely
interesting
throughout
,
even
when
the
motion
the
character
go
through
seem
familiar
.
the
resonance
to
donnie
's
actual
assignment
vary
,
he
often
report
back
to
the
fed
with
detail
of
he
progress
,
but
it
do
not
always
seem
to
have
much
meaning
.
back
home
,
he
wife
maggie
-lrb-
heche
-rrb-
be
ready
to
divorce
he
because
he
be
never
a
and
the
family
be
suffer
.
since
this
be
base
on
a
true
story
i
would
not
doubt
this
would
happen
,
although
the
way
it
be
handle
often
border
on
the
melodramatic
.
my
only
major
complaint
be
the
film
seem
to
have
no
final
act
,
or
at
least
any
real
sense
of
closure
.
a
climax
of
sort
do
occur
,
but
there
be
little
feeling
of
a
payoff
.
we
get
a
happy
ending
,
which
be
good
,
but
perhaps
a
sad
end
would
have
be
more
powerful
.
aside
from
a
few
minor
,
general
flaw
,
''
donnie
brasco
''
manage
to
be
a
solid
piece
of
storytelling
and
character
development
.
it
may
be
routine
,
but
it
be
good
,
and
that
be
respectful
.
