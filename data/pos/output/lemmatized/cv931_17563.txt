like
the
great
musical
piece
of
mozart
himself
,
amadeus
be
a
true
work
of
art
.
it
be
one
of
those
few
movie
of
the
80
's
that
will
be
know
for
its
class
,
its
style
,
and
its
intelligence
.
why
be
this
such
a
good
film
?
there
be
almost
too
many
reason
to
explain
.
the
story
:
court
composer
salierus
-lrb-
f
.
murray
abraham
-rrb-
feel
wave
of
different
emotion
go
through
he
head
as
wolfgang
amadeus
mozart
-lrb-
tom
hulce
-rrb-
come
into
he
life
as
the
young
genius
composer
.
salierus
feel
envy
,
and
jealousy
,
but
at
the
same
time
be
fascinate
with
mozart
's
brilliance
and
ingenious
.
we
travel
through
mozart
's
life
as
a
composer
,
through
he
struggle
,
he
triumph
,
and
ultimately
,
he
demise
.
the
acting
:
abraham
be
magnificient
as
salierus
;
he
act
range
enable
he
to
focus
on
each
individual
emotion
and
express
it
through
he
speech
and
body
language
.
this
performance
earn
he
a
well
deserve
oscar
.
tom
hulce
be
interesting
as
well
as
mozart
,
a
quirky
,
annoying
bratty
kid
with
a
annoying
laugh
.
he
be
strong
,
but
weak
at
the
same
time
,
and
must
be
aid
by
he
wife
-lrb-
elizabeth
berridge
-rrb-
,
who
be
good
in
she
role
,
but
lack
dramatic
depth
.
jeffrey
jone
,
in
a
smaller
,
more
dignified
role
than
such
role
in
stay
tune
and
mom
and
dad
save
the
world
,
be
cast
perfectly
because
of
he
noble
charm
.
the
movie
:
every
element
of
this
movie
work
.
the
costume
and
makeup
be
very
memorable
,
as
well
as
its
stunning
art
direction
,
and
unforgettable
score
-lrb-
adapt
from
mozart
's
original
music
-rrb-
.
while
wolfgang
amadeus
mozart
be
a
genius
at
music
,
milo
forman
prove
with
he
film
that
he
be
a
genius
of
filmmaking
.
this
movie
be
a
classic
that
will
be
remember
for
year
to
come
.
