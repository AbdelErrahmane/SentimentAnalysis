,
to
try
to
save
he

bastard
get
a
hold
of

once
arrive
in
the
year
1967
,
austin
travels
to
he
''
pad
''
,
he
smashing
home\/dance
club
,
where
he
meet
felicity
shagwell
,
play
by
heather
graham
,
a
cium
agent
who
be
willing
to
help
he
in
he
journey
to
stop
dr
.
evil
.
as
the
film
progress
,
hilarious
one
liner
be
throw
at
we
,
mainly
by
dr
.
evil
,
for
example
,
''
do
not
go
there
,
girlfriend
!
''
to
the
president
of
the
united
state
.
many
witty
gag
take
place
,
note
the
entire
tent
scene
,
and
just
plain
,
funny
scene
which
be
so
stupid
-
they
be
funny
come
a
dozen
per
fifteen
minute
.
take
for
example
,
scott
evil
go
on
the
jerry
springer
show
complain
about
how
evil
he
father
be
.
the
way
austin
power
:
tswsm
use
its
humor
be
clever
,
throw
a
hilarious
scene
at
you
,
follow
by
five
minute
of
one
liner
,
follow
by
another
outrageous
scene
,
so
you
never
stop
laugh
.
there
be
honestly
not
one
moment
in
austin
power
:
tswsm
where
i
be
not
laugh
.
the
last
film
that
i
laugh
so
hard
in
,
be
well
,
austin
power
!
it
be
apparent
that
mike
myer
know
how
funny
this
film
be
while
write
it
.
the
film
even
make
fun
of
itself
in
a
line
,
something
along
the
line
of
,
''
it
be
funny
how
england
and
southern
californium
look
nothing
alike
.
''
tswsm
be
film
in
southern
californium
,
but
be
suppose
to
take
place
in
england
.
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
-
he
be
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
this
enormously
popular
character
,
which
be
all
over
television
,
newspaper
,
magazine
,
and
the
movie
theater
.
i
believe
that
dr
.
evil
get
more
attention
in
the
tswsm
than
austin
power
do
.
dr
.
evil
provide
more
laugh
,
more
memorable
moment
,
and
more
interesting
dialogue
than
austin
do
this
time
around
,
who
seem
to
miss
the
funny
touch
that
he
have
in
the
first
film
.
i
feel
that
austin
really
do
have
he
mojo
take
away
,
but
from
screenplay
writer
mike
myer
,
not
fat
bastard
.
also
make
a
great
addition
to
the
series
be
mini
I
,
who
be
play
by
verne
troyer
.
even
though
the
midget
actor
be
30
year
old
,
he
be
adorable
by
dr
.
evil
's
side
constantly
.
the
first
austin
power
film
have
barely
any
sentimental
quality
,
such
as
lack
of
character
development
,
barely
any
detailed
plot
characteristic
,
and
barely
any
good
acting
,
but
austin
power
tswsm
actually
show
some
quality
behind
the
frequent
humor
.
mike
myer
,
with
he
three
role
,
act
as
eddie
murphy
do
in
the
nutty
professor
,
disguise
himself
completely
in
one
of
the
role
.
-lrb-
fat
bastard
-rrb-
all
three
character
be
different
,
and
mike
myer
do
do
a
good
job
handle
each
one
of
they
.
heather
graham
make
a
great
addition
with
she
talent
to
tswsm
,
and
do
a
much
better
job
than
elizabeth
hurley
do
,
who
give
a
very
flat
performance
in
the
original
,
speak
she
line
without
any
feeling
or
emotion
.
speaking
of
hurley
,
she
can
be
see
in
tswsm
for
a
few
brief
moment
.
hopefully
,
graham
tag
along
for
future
austin
power
adventure
.
the
bottom
line
-
a
groovy
sequel
that
mike
myer
put
all
of
he
mojo
into
write
.
