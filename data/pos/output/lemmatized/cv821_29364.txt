,
help
bread

from
become
a
tired
retread
.
ganz
play
the
suicidal
waiter
role
with
a
solemn
,
sometimes
playful
dignity
that
be
a
joy
to
watch
,
while
maglietta
never
overreact
to
she
grow
comfort
with
the
outside
world
.
throughout
the
movie
,
maglietta
have
a
easygoing
,
confident
demeanor
,
which
make
it
very
easy
to
root
for
she
and
she
grow
attraction
for
ganz
's
character
.
the
gorgeous
scenery
of
moonlit
town
square
and
sparkling
river
provide
a
perfect
love
story
backdrop
--
you
just
might
want
to
ask
the
attractive
stranger
in
the
seat
behind
you
for
coffee
after
the
light
come
up
.
director
and
co-writer
silvio
soldinus
must
get
credit
for
sprinkle
the
movie
with
effective
goofy
humor
.
the
cheap
mimmo
,
desperate
to
find
he
wife
-lrb-
after
all
,
he
need
he
shirt
iron
and
he
mistress
will
not
do

-rrb-
,
hire
a

the

love
detective
story
.
the
novice
detective
's
various
misfortune
,
include
he
say
goodbye
to
he
weepy
mother
,
be
very
funny
.
unfortunately
,
there
be
flaw
that
somewhat
spoil
bread
and
tulip
'
cheery
tone
.
rosalba
be
bother
by
several
surreal
dream
during
she
time
in
venice
,
which
bring
the
movie
to
a
halt
.
it
be
like
put
a
gunfight
in
a
nora
ephron
movie
.
several
detail
in
fernando
's
life
also
never
get
proper
closure
,
include
he
suicidal
tendency
.
early
in
the
movie
,
he
nearly
hang
himself
before
rosalba
knock
on
he
apartment
door
.
after
that
,
fernando
's
step
towards
death
be
never
make
reference
to
,
probably
because
soldinus
want
to
include
a
lukewarm
,
underdeveloped
subplot
about
fernando
's
stormy
past
.
it
seem
more
like
a
desperate
attempt
to
pump
up
the
drama
in
a
plot
that
do
not
need
any
.
but
there
be
not
a
lot
of
overwhelming
negative
in
bread
and
tulip
.
the
movie
be
fun
and
romantic
,
with
beautiful
scenery
and
character
whose
life
we
would
like
to
live
if
we
have
the
nerve
...
or
if
we
passport
be
not
miss
.
