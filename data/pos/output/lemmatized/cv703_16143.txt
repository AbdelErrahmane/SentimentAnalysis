''
you
have
get
mail
''
be
the
very
definition
of
a
''
cute
''
movie
.
it
be
get
cute
star
,
a
cute
story-line
,
and
even
cute
pet
.
despite
this
over-whelming
cuteness
-lrb-
or
maybe
because
of
it
-rrb-
,
i
love
''
you
have
get
mail
''
.
i
know
,
i
know
.
i
be
suppose
to
be
a
film
critic
.
i
be
not
suppose
to
love
transparent
and
formulum
picture
like
this
.
but
darn
it
,
somewhere
along
the
way
,
''
you
have
get
mail
''
reel
I
in
,
hook
,
line
,
and
sinker
.
the
movie
star
tom
hank
and
meg
ryan
as
two
somewhat
unhappy
new
yorker
who
meet
in
a
aol
online
chat
room
and
quickly
become
close
friend
,
without
ever
know
each
other
identity
.
as
the
movie
progress
,
though
,
they
begin
to
discover
that
they
have
a
lot
in
common
with
each
other
.
meanwhile
,
in
''
real-life
''
,
they
be
bitter
competitor
.
she
own
a
quaint
little
child
's
bookstore
,
he
own
one
of
those
gigantic
super-bookstore
that
offer
impersonal
service
and
discount
price
.
while
he
store
threaten
to
run
she
store
out
of
business
,
they
online
relationship
grow
stronger
.
''
you
have
get
mail
''
be
as
artificial
as
movie
come
.
everything
be
nice
and
happy
and
by
the
end
,
all
the
character
have
get
exactly
what
they
want
out
of
life
.
there
be
no
real
conflict
,
no
major
disappointment
,
no
unresolved
issue
.
nevertheless
,
i
quite
enjoy
it
.
in
fact
,
i
can
not
remember
the
last
time
i
have
such
a
good
time
at
the
movie
.
i
think
sometimes
you
have
to
be
able
to
watch
a
movie
and
just
get
draw
into
it
.
the
fact
that
star
hank
and
ryan
be
at
the
top
of
they
game
do
not
hurt
either
.
in
particular
,
hank
be
at
he
best
here
,
turn
he
''
charm-meter
''
up
to
11
.
everytime
he
be
on
screen
,
he
have
my
full
attention
.
and
despite
the
fact
that
he
be
drive
little
bookstore
out
of
business
,
i
be
root
for
he
.
it
be
good
to
see
hank
back
do
what
he
do
best
:
play
the
affable
everyman
.
''
you
have
get
mail
''
certainly
will
not
be
win
any
award
,
but
as
a
exercise
in
pure
entertainment
,
it
be
as
good
as
it
get
.
