_
be
not
a
great
film
.
a
bit
slow
at
time
and
more
than
a
little
rough
around
the
edge
as
it
build
to
its
climactic
explosion
of
violent
action
,
this
spirited
but
formulaic
yarn
that
initially
bring
ernest
tidyman
's
''
black
private
dick
that
be
a
sex
machine
to
all
the
chick
''
to
the
big
screen
hardly
qualify
as
groundbreak
filmmaking
.
yet
nearly
30
year
after
its
original
release
--
and
long
after
the
genre
it
spawn
,
''
blaxploitation
,
''
die
with
that
decade
--
the
1971
_
shaft
_
remain
a
extremely
entertaining
watch
,
never
have
completely
escape
pop
culture
consciousness
.
the
reason
for
this
be
the
same
one
that
explain
the
film
's
connection
with
moviegoer
far
beyond
the
target
african-american
audience
:
the
title
character
of
john
shaft
.
while
the
fact
that
the
strong
,
smart
,
virile
,
and
superbly
suave
shaft
be
black
be
the
primary
factor
for
he
historical
and
cultural
significance
,
he
broad-based
appeal
stem
from
a
idea
that
transcend
race
:
he
be
comfortable
,
confident
,
and
proud
about
who
he
be
,
and
anyone
who
have
a
problem
with
that
could
simply
kiss
he
ass
.
this
fact
also
explain
why
john
singleton
's
y2g
revival
of
john
shaft
be
as
enjoyable
as
it
be
.
much
like
the
film
that

this

_
's
plot
do
not
score
point
in
the
originality
department
,
but
the
energy
level
and
smooth
attitude
distinguish
it
from
standard
crime
thriller
.
contrary
to
what

this

funny
