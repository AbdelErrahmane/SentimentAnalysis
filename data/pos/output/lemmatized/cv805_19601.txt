the
third
installment
in
the
godfather-trilogy
.
this
new
film
have
be
underrate
for
no
reason
.
it
be
as
intellectual
and
majestically
make
as
copollum
's
pervious
film
.
it
be
also
more
psychological
,
pessimistic
and
more
tragic
than
the
first
two
.
the
only
regret
be
the
unconvincing
performance
by
the
newcomer
sofium
copollum
and
some
''
unfinished
''
development
of
some
character
.
the
film
elegantly
begin
with
nino
rota
's
recognizable
musical
score
,
the
beautiful
skyscraper
of
new
york
and
michael
's
voice
as
he
be
write
a
letter
to
he
child
:
''
the
only
wealth
in
this
world
be
child
.
more
than
all
money
and
power
on
earth
,
you
be
my
treasure
''
.
the
year
be
1979
and
michael
corleone
have
use
the
time
since
the
ending
of
''
part
ii
''
to
make
he
father
's
dream
come
true
-
make
the
corleone
family
legitimate
.
michael
sell
all
he
casino
and
invest
only
in
gambling
.
constantly
haunt
by
the
past
,
he
only
reason
to
live
be
he
child
.
the
family
have
amass
unimaginable
wealth
,
and
as
the
film
open
michael
corleone
-lrb-
al
pacino
-rrb-
be
be
invest
with
a
great
honor
by
the
church
.
later
that
day
,
at
a
reception
,
he
daughter
announce
a
corleone
family
gift
to
the
church
and
the
charity
of
sicily
,
''
a
check
in
the
amount
of
$
100
million
.
''
but
the
corleone
be
about
to
find
,
as
other
have
throughout
history
,
that
you
can
not
buy
forgiveness
.
sure
,
you
can
do
business
with
evil
man
inside
the
church
,
for
all
man
be
fallible
and
capable
of
sin
.
but
god
do
not
take
payoff
.
the
plot
of
the
movie
,
concoct
by
coppolum
and
mario
puzo
in
a
screenplay
inspire
by
headline
,
bring
the
corleone
family
into
the
inner
circle
of
corruption
in
the
vatican
.
there
be
a
moment
in
''
godfather
iii
''
where
michael
say
:
''
all
my
life
i
have
be
try
to
go
up
in
society
,
where
everything
be
legal
.
but
the
higher
i
go
,
the
crookier
it
become
.
.
''
.
visually
this
film
be
as
spectacular
as
the
first
two
.
gordon
willi
'
rich
cinematography
,
carmine
copollum
's
beautiful
composition
and
alex
tavoulari
'
wonderful
art
direction
could
not
be
better
.
but
copollum
's
first
two
godfather-film
be
more
famous
for
they
deep
,
intellectual
plot
,
tree
dimensional
character
and
incredible
acting
,
than
for
they
visual
perfection
.
the
third
installment
have
only
the
plot
and
visual
.
some
character
could
be
much
more
developed
and
the
act
,
although
good
,
never
accomplish
to
reach
the
same
height
of
the
first
two
film
.
the
biggest
miscasting
be
sofia
copollum
,
who
be
so
unconvincing
and
unemotional
that
she
manage
to
ruin
several
scene
throughout
the
movie
,
that
could
have
be
grander
and
more
emotional
.
the
best
performance
come
unsurprisingly
from
al
pacino
,
who
should
have
get
a
nomination
for
best
actor
at
the
oscar
.
andy
garcium
be
powerful
as
sonny
's
son
,
strong
,
focus
and
loyal
.
violence
be
natural
to
he
.
he
suffer
no
pang
of
conscience
when
he
take
revenge
on
he
family
's
behalf
,
and
in
this
he
be
suppose
to
be
strong
in
the
uncomplicated
way
don
vito
corleone
be
.
however
both
kay
-lrb-
diane
keaton
-rrb-
and
connie
-lrb-
talium
shire
-rrb-
be
useless
.
and
character
like
vito
corleone
and
tom
hagen
be
really
miss
.
the
good
part
be
that
michael
be
again
reunite
with
old
friend
,
that
you
remember
from
the
first
and
second
film
.
in
the
third
film
michael
have
become
almost
like
he
father
,
vito
in
the
first
film
and
vincenzo
resemble
michael
when
he
be
much
younger
.
this
parallel
could
be
more
interesting
if
vincenzo
's
character
be
more
develop
.
many
have
point
out
that
make
the
third
film
,
be
unnecessary
.
i
disagree
.
it
be
a
beautiful
film
of
great
importance
,
complete
the
tragic
saga
of
the
corleone
family
.
the
first
film
show
some
horrible
result
of
corleone
's
life
.
it
show
michael
make
a
choice
;
the
second
show
a
man
damn
himself
for
he
choice
and
feel
the
impact
of
change
time
.
a
man
desperately
try
to
keep
he
balance
,
focus
,
family
and
sanity
,
while
everything
be
crash
all
around
he
.
the
third
film
be
a
terrifying
conclusion
-
a
result
of
michael
's
life
.
the
life
he
choose
for
himself
be
like
quicksand
-
one
wrong
step
and
you
be
doom
.
there
be
no
turn
back
.
and
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
to
get
out
of
it
,
to
free
yourself
,
no
matter
how
powerful
and
wealthy
you
be
,
you
be
helpless
-
sink
deeper
and
deeper
till
it
swallow
you
completely
.
the
beautifully
direct
last
sequence
be
also
the
powerful
climax
of
the
film
,
when
michael
be
sit
alone
in
he
chair
,
leave
by
everyone
,
surround
by
emptiness
and
memory
of
he
friend
and
family
member
long
dead
.
here
he
die
-
alone
,
miserable
and
unforgiven
