david
koepp
keep
the
action
localized
;
the
majority
of
the
action
take
place
at
tom
's
house
or
just
down
the
street
.
by
keep
thing
at

,
koepp
be
able
to
proceed
without
have
to
resort
to
any
clumsy
segue
-lrb-
montage
of
drive
down
road
as
we
move
from
one
city
to
another
etc
.
-rrb-
.
unfortunately
,
the
dread
and
spookiness
of
stir
of
echo
be
frequently
interrupt
by
moment
of
levity
.
humor
can
take
the
tension
away
from
a
scene
faster
than
any
shoddy
special
effect
or
poor
acting
.
several
tense
moment
become
completely
diffuse
by
a
few
misplace
joke
.
also
,
there
be
a
couple
of
plot
development
that
be
leave
unresolved
,
though
to
mention
they
would
be
to
give
too
much
away
.
kevin
bacon
handle
the
duel
task
of
play
a
everyman
and
a
man
lose
he
sanity
admirably
.
he
total
lack
of
understanding
of
what
be
happen
to
he
be
believable
,
as
be
the
reaction
from
he
wife
maggie
.
kathryn
erbe
be
give
a
role
meatier
and
better
write
than
that
of
most
''
wife
who
can
no
longer
handle
she
husband
''
part
.
while
it
be
still
a
support
role
,
she
maggie
be
move
as
she
watch
both
she
husband
and
she
son
enter
what
she
call
''
a
private
club
that
i
be
not
invite
to
''
,
where
they
whisper
about
thing
all
day
long
.
as
jake
,
zachary
cope
equal
the
performance
of
haley
joel
osment
in
the
sixth
sense
,
but
get
less
screen
time
.
both
child
manage
the
same
trick
,
make
the
audience
creep
out
by
they
apparent
acceptance
of
the
way
thing
be
.
fan
of
blair
and
sixth
sense
will
almost
surely
love
stir
of
echo
.
it
combine
the
dread
of
blair
,
a
creepy
closed-in
feel
thanks
to
cinematographer
fred
murphy
and
great
performance
by
the
whole
cast
,
specifically
bacon
,
to
give
the
fall
its
first
genuine
scary
film
.
if
only
they
have
let
up
on
the
unneeded
funny
bit
and
tweak
the
plot
a
bit
more
,
this
could
have
be
one
of
the
year
's
best
.
