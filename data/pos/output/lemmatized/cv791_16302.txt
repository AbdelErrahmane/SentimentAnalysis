the

what

be
this
that

be
a
bigger

brutal
,
ecstatic
violence

-rrb-
the
police
arrive
just
as
derek
kill
the
last
thief
.
derek
do
not
resist
the
cop
,
and
as
they
spin
he
around
to
cuff
he
,
the
film
slow
down
.
derek
raise
he
eyebrow
and
smile
at
he
little
brother
in
a
chill
,
sadistic
,
satisfied
grin
.
now
in
prison
,
derek
face
new
challenge
.
as
the
black
man
in
the
laundry
tell
he
,
''
in
the
joint
,
you
the
nigra
,
not
I
.
''
there
be
a
clique
of
swastika-wearing
skinhead
,
but
they
be
not
interested
in
the
ideology
of
white
supremacy
.
they
only
use
the
symbol
as
a
means
of
intimidation
.
derek
find
himself
truly
alone
,
truly
in
danger
,
and
truly
afraid
.
when
derek
finally
get
out
of
prison
,
he
find
that
he
friend
from
the
gang
have
also
change
.
without
derek
's
leadership
,
they
have
shun
the
white
supremacist
ideology
for
the
white
supremacist
culture
.
it
be
the
final
factor
that
make
he
realize
how
badly
he
be
screw
up
.
in
the
end
,
he
spend
quality
time
with
be
brother
try
to
undo
the
respect
and
admiration
he
have
earlier
inspire
in
danny
.
the
film
end
a
little
too
deliberately
,
too
neatly
after
the
unchained
emotion
and
violent
glee
of
the
rest
of
the
film
,
but
it
barely
detract
from
the
overall
experience
.
edward
norton
give
a
oscar-worthy
performance
.
although
some
of
he
dialogue
seem
to
be
write
without
enough
conviction
,
norton
's
performance
compensate
.
-lrb-
a
example
that
come
to
mind
be
he
pep
talk
before
looting
the
store
.
-rrb-
he
also
capture
the
essence
of
a
older
brother
.
he
take
he
responsibility
as
a
role
model
to
he
younger
brother
very
seriously
,
very
lovingly
,
both
before
and
after
he
change
of
heart
.
though
clearly
not
for
all
taste
,
this
film
be
bold
and
daring
.
the
subject
matter
be
ugly
,
cruel
,
and
at
time
hard
to
look
at
.
nevertheless
its
subject
be
part
of
humanity
's
great
face
.
kaye
give
we
a
good
look
at
this
fascinating
,
if
distasteful
,
american
subculture
.
