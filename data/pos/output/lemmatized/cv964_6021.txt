you
have
get
to
think
twice
before
you
go
see
a
movie
with
a
title
like
maximum
risk
.
the
title
be
generic
.
it
be
meaningless
.
and
i
can
not
believe
it
be
good
business
.
when
you
pick
up
the
phone
and
dial
777-film
,
how
in
the
world
be
you
suppose
to
remember
that
the
new
jean-claude
van
damme
movie
,
the
one
that
look
kind
of
cool
in
the
trailer
and
be
direct
by
some
chinese
hot
shot
,
be
call
,
geez
,
maximum
risk
?
yuck
.
the
movie
itself
deserve
you
attention
.
for
sweet
bloody
thrill
,
this
one
beat
the
summer
blockbuster
competition
hands-down
.
only
mission
:
impossible
come
close
to
deliver
as
skillful
a
thriller
,
and
i
'll
give
maximum
risk
the
edge
simply
because
it
be
not
as
slick
as
the
tom
cruise
picture
,
and
therefore
more
gratifying
in
its
execution
.
much
to
my
surprise
,
van
damme
continue
to
develop
as
a
pleasant
,
unpretentious
action
hero
.
he
track
record
be
not
as
solid
as
schwarzenegger
's
,
but
he
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
adventurous
than
arnold
.
in
1993
,
van
damme
work
with
hong
kong
's
premier
hardcore
action
director
,
john
woo
,
on
a
fairly
lame
movie
call
hard
target
.
-lrb-
if
you
can
find
a
bootleg
copy
,
woo
's
radically
different
director
's
cut
be
much
better
than
what
be
eventually
release
.
-rrb-
this
follow-up
be
direct
by
ringo
lam
-lrb-
city
on
fire
,
full
contact
-rrb-
,
whose
hong
kong
film
be
distinguish
action
picture
that
have
consistently
play
second
fiddle
to
woo
's
more
operatic
offering
.
the
surprise
here
be
that
maximum
risk
be
a
more
effective
hollywood
action
flick
than
either
hard
target
or
woo
's
subsequent
broken
arrow
.
here
be
the
rundown
.
van
damme
play
a
french
cop
name
alain
moreau
who
be
shake
when
a
policeman
friend
-lrb-
jean-hugue
anglade
-rrb-
find
a
corpse
that
be
alain
's
exact
double
.
turn
out
alain
be
separate
at
birth
from
he
twin
brother
,
michael
,
who
have
be
kill
by
some
russian
heavy
-lrb-
and
some
strangely
american
look
cop
-rrb-
.
alain
do
some
investigate
.
he
find
that
michael
have
book
a
flight
to
new
york
city
,
and
receive
a
message
from
someone
there
name
alex
bohemia
.
assume
michael
's
identity
,
alain
fly
to
new
york
and
get
tangle
up
with
michael
's
girlfriend
-lrb-
natasha
henstridge
-rrb-
,
the
fbus
,
and
the
russian
mob
in
little
odessa
.
that
be
as
much
as
you
need
to
know
.
the
story
be
adequate
,
but
not
overly
involve
--
and
the
major
plot
point
be
basically
explain
to
you
twice
,
just
in
case
you
go
out
for
popcorn
at
the
wrong
moment
.
there
be
a
love
story
,
too
,
but
i
do
not
find
it
terribly
convince
,
partly
because
ex-model
henstridge
be
too
high-strung
in
she
high-profile
debut
-lrb-
she
have
precious
few
line
as
the
alien
ice
queen
in
species
-rrb-
.
she
be
great
to
look
at
,
and
she
can
certainly
read
a
line
,
but
what
she
do
here
can
not
really
be
describe
as
''
act
.
''
of
course
,
''
act
''
be
not
really
what
she
be
hire
for
-lrb-
i
lose
track
of
whether
she
shirt
come
off
more
often
than
van
damme
's
-rrb-
.
the
movie
be
exceptionally
violent
,
border
on
gratuity
.
-lrb-
keep
that
in
mind
when
plan
you
date
.
-rrb-
the
stunt
be
spectacular
,
and
the
fact
that
you
can
spot
van
damme
's
stand-in
make
he
work
no
less
impressive
.
there
be
only
so
much
you
can
do
with
a
car
wreck
,
but
this
movie
make
crisp
,
effective
use
of
pile-up
in
a
handful
of
frenzied
destruction
derby
.
and
lam
have
a
surprising
,
innovative
sense
of
exactly
where
the
camera
should
go
to
catch
any
bit
of
action
.
the
main
difference
between
lam
and
woo
,
i
believe
,
be
that
while
woo
rely
on
sheer
spectacle
to
gas
up
he
action
show
piece
,
lam
have
figure
out
more
about
use
cinematic
space
and
double-barreled
point
of
view
to
make
thing
run
.
do
not
get
I
wrong
--
when
chow
yun-fat
soar
through
space
pump
bullet
out
of
two
pistol
and
chew
on
a
toothpick
with
glass
and
confetti
litter
the
air
around
he
in
woo
's
hard-boiled
,
it
be
a
amazing
moment
.
but
it
be
a
moment
that
be
hard
to
reproduce
in
hollywood
.
-lrb-
for
one
thing
,
hollywood
do
not
yet
have
chow
yun-fat
!
-rrb-
while
woo
's
hollywood
movie
look
like
the
work
of
a
talented
upstart
,
maximum
risk
be
a
surprisingly
confident
picture
.
the
very
first
shot
of
the
film
be
a
awkward
overhead
view
of
a
chase
through
the
street
of
a
european
city
,
but
lam
's
use
of
odd
camera
angle
become
more
efficient
later
on
.
the
film
editing
be
a
particularly
savvy
complement
to
lam
's
shooting
style
,
accentuate
rather
than
amplify
the
action
.
the
performance
could
have
use
some
fine
tuning
-lrb-
in
particular
,
there
be
a
annoying
,
overwritten
manhattan
cab
driver
in
the
early
scene
who
should
have
be
tone
down
or
jettison
completely
-rrb-
,
and
the
movie
do
not
always
overcome
the
limitation
of
its
genre
.
the
story
be
a
little
mundane
,
although
there
be
some
effective
moment
involve
van
damme
's
unrequited
feeling
toward
the
brother
he
never
know
he
have
.
but
it
be
not
often
that
hollywood
crank
out
a
truly
satisfying
action
picture
,
and
it
be
doubly
surprising
that
this
one
should
come
with
a
mere
whisper
of
publicity
.
van
damme
fan
should
treat
themselves
to
what
may
well
be
the
man
's
best
movie
,
and
international
action
buff
will
no
doubt
savor
this
flavorful
hong
kong\/hollywood
hybrid
.
