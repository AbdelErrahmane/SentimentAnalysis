be
the
self-proclaimed
professional
film
critic
that
i
be
,
i
be
somewhat
embarrassed
to
admit
that
i
have
not
see
lawrence
of
arabium
-lrb-
come
soon
to
dvd
-rrb-
until
only
recently
.
after
all
,
it
be
consider
by
just
about
everyone
to
be
the
masterpiece
epic
of
director
david
lean
,
who
also
direct
film
such
as
bridge
on
the
river
kwaus
,
and
doctor
zhivago
.
so
one
day
,
a
friend
of
mine
loan
I
a
copy
of
the
video
and
i
sit
down
and
watch
it
.
i
be
initially
skeptical
that
something
make
almost
40
year
ago
would
be
able
to
keep
my
attention
for
the
butt-numbing
3Â 1\/2
hour
of
its
duration
.
but
now
i
fully
understand
why
this
have
become
the
film
that
other
epic
film
be
judge
against
--
the
winner
of
seven
academy
award
in
1963
for
best
picture
,
director
,
editing
,
cinematography
,
art
direction
,
music
,
and
sound
.
after
watch
the
film
again
,
i
be
convince
that
it
be
simply
one
of
the
finest
work
of
cinematic
genius
to
ever
illuminate
the
big
screen
.

i
can
only
imagine
what
it
must
have
be
like
to
sit
in
a
theater
in
1962
and
watch
this
story
unfold
before
my
eye
.
every
shot
be
choreograph
as
a
portrait
--
a
living
tribute
to
a
great
land
.
david
lean
put
he
reputation
on
the
line
to
get
this
film
complete
,
and
the
fact
that
it
be
even
greenlit
in
the
first
place
say
something
about
the
ideology
of
the
motion
picture
industry
at
the
time
,
a
far
cry
from
its
pathetic
,
uncreative
existence
today
.
after
watch
the
film
,
the
first
thing
that
come
to
my
mind
be
,
''
i
have
get
to
do
a
remake
of
this
film
!
''
but
then
i
think
about
try
to
pitch
the
idea
to
a
modern-day
movie
executive
:
''
okay
,
it
be
go
to
be
almost
four
hour
long
and
shoot
over
three
month
on
location
in
the
sahara
desert
.
we
be
go
to
need
to
blow
up
a
full-size
train
because
computer-generated
effect
probably
wont
do
it
justice
.
and
we
be
not
go
to
use
any
big
star
,
and
will
not
have
any
female
actor
since
there
be
no
love
story
.
''
yes
,
my
friend
,
the
velvet
curtain
fall
on
the
golden-era
of
hollywood
a
long
time
ago
.
but
at
least
we
still
have
the
proof
to
show
all
would-be
producer
and
director
out
there
just
how
good
a
film
can
be
.
