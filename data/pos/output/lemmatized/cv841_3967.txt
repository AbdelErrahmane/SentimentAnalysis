let
's
face
it
:
since
waterworld
float
by
,
the
summer
movie
season
have
grow
\*
very
\*
stale
.
with
no
new
eye-candy
for
four
week
straight
,
we
have
have
to
sustain
ourselves
on
the
quasi-nutritional
value
of
cheatin
'
husband
,
travel
chocolate
salesman
,
and
computer
-
generate
serial
killer
.
sigh
.
thank
god
for
desperado
.
the
freewheeling
sequel
to
el
mariachus
--
director
robert
rodriguez
's
notorious
$
7000
debut
--
star
a
cool
antonio
bandera
as
the
return
guitarist
with
no
name
.
he
be
a
man
in
black
with
revenge
on
he
mind
,
and
a
arsenal
in
he
case
.
-lrb-
the
woman
he
love
be
kill
in
the
first
film
.
-rrb-
so
,
he
spend
the
entire
story
shooting
drug
dealer
;
sort
of
a
tex-mex
version
of
the
punisher
,
if
you
will
.
there
be
not
much
of
a
emotional
core
to
desperado
.
rodriguez
be
have
too
much
fun
find
new
and
innovative
way
to
pay
homage
to
john
woo
.
-lrb-
and
sergio
leone
...
and
sam
peckinpah
...
-rrb-
some
may
wince
at
the
body
count
--
at
least
100
graphic
killing
be
a
fair
estimate
--
but
it
be
all
play
for
laugh
.
big
,
broad
,
hispanic
laugh
that
,
for
I
,
recall
the
physical
comedy
of
blake
edward
and
he
pink
panther
film
.
sick
,
slick
fun
.
