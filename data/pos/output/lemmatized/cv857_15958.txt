what
i
look
for
in
a
movie
be
not
necessarily
perfection
.
sometimes
a
movie
have
such
strong
idea
that
despite
whatever
flaw
it
may
have
,
i
will
prefer
it
to
a
better-made
film
that
be
not
as
thought-provoking
.
the
thin
red
line
be
flaw
but
it
provoke
.
terence
malick
return
to
filmmake
20
year
after
day
of
heaven
and
produce
this
meditative
look
at
war
.
unlike
this
year
's
saving
private
ryan
,
which
dwell
on
war
as
a
necessary
evil
and
explore
the
moral
ambiguity
thereof
,
the
thin
red
line
simply
say
war
be
waste
.
while
that
might
seem
obvious
to
some
,
only
after
experience
the
film
do
you
realize
how
profound
a
waste
it
be
.
save
private
ryan
have
a
underlying
and
practical
acceptance
that
war
will
occur
and
it
have
a
great
cost
;
the
thin
red
line
say
idealistically
avoid
this
at
all
cost
.
one
message
be
not
necessarily
more
correct
than
the
other
.
it
just
depend
on
one
's
point
of
view
.
in
malick
's
film
,
war
be
set
in
a
tropical
paradise
,
and
john
toll
's
cinematography
be
beyond
lush
.
the
setting
pose
the
question
,
why
be
we
fight
in
the
face
of
such
beauty
?
in
save
private
ryan
,
the
capture
of
a
german
soldier
present
the
moral
quandary
of
whether
to
let
he
go
.
in
the
thin
red
line
,
the
japanese
present
the
moral
quandary
of
war
in
the
first
place
.
they
be
just
like
the
american
--
frightened
and
angry
,
grieving
and
pray
.
all
that
separate
they
be
war
.
the
flaw
in
the
thin
red
line
come
in
the
voice-over
.
unbelievable
as
come
from
the
character
and
sometimes
pretentious
,
sometimes
corny
,
the
voice-over
tell
we
what
the
image
before
we
already
do
and
be
completely
unnecessary
.
dispense
with
they
,
malick
could
have
achieve
a
tarkovskian
grandeur
.
instead
,
he
get
distract
self-consciousness
.
aside
from
that
,
malick
's
direction
be
stunning
.
the
tracking
shot
across
windswept
hill
and
around
transport
speed
toward
shore
be
extraordinary
.
sean
penn
,
elia
kotea
,
and
nick
nolte
give
the
best
performance
.
penn
be
subtle
as
a
sergeant
try
to
hide
he
humanism
,
kotea
be
genuine
as
a
compassionate
captain
,
and
nolte
startling
as
a
colonel
whose
blood
vessel
be
about
to
burst
if
he
can
not
win
he
battle
.
john
travolta
and
george
clooney
be
the
worst
in
cameo
role
.
ultimately
however
,
the
thin
red
line
's
interest
be
not
in
the
character
and
it
be
not
in
drama
.
it
have
be
frequently
criticize
for
its
lack
of
dramatic
structure
,
but
malick
clearly
have
different
thing
on
he
mind
.
have
no
one
ever
think
that
get
dramatic
entertainment
from
war
be
exploitative
?
what
malick
be
work
with
be
theme
,
and
in
that
,
the
thin
red
line
be
most
provoke
.
