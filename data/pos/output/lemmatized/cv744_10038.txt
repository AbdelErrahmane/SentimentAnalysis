.
you
know
disney
,
they
can
not
deal
with
the
threat
of
any
other
studio
get
even
a
small
piece
of
the
crust
of
the
kiddie
entertainment
pie
,
so
when
someone
else
want
to
make
a
little
money
,
they
counter
with
a
old
''
masterpiece
''
from
they
vault
and
,
you
know
what
,
i
go
to
see
this
1989
cartoon
rather
than
the
brand
new
one
from
fox
.
let
no
one
say
disney
be
lose
its
monopoly
on
the
market
.
they
still
have
hotel
on
boardwalk
_
and
_
park
place
.
believe
it
or
not
,

,
November
25
,
1997
,
at
5
:
05
p
.
m
.
,
i
see
the
little
mermaid
for
the
first
time
.
it
take
I
a
few
year
to
get
over
a
aversion
to
this
movie
that
be
cause
seven
year
ago
,
when
i
stay
with
one
of
my
mom
's
friend
for
a
couple
week
.
they
have
a
young
child
who
listen
to
the
little
mermaid
soundtrack
constantly
and
,
over
that
two
week
period
,
i
hear
every
song
from
the
movie
probably
a
hundred
time
.
by
the
time
i
get
back
home
,
i
promise
myself
i
would
never
see
the
movie
.
but
promise
be
make
to
be
break
,
especially
when
you
be
look
at
a
17-day
,
limited
engagement
.
damn
those
shrewd
disney
marketer
and
they
mind
game
.
the
little
mermaid
be
base
on
a
han
christian
anderson
fairy
tale
,
but
it
be
disney-ized
,
which
mean
lot
of
talk
animal
and
burst
into
song
.
it
also
mean
the
heroine
be
a
total
babe
who
show
off
cleavage
from
a
seashell
bra
at
all
time
.
i
never
want
so
much
to
be
a
pair
of
shell
...
the
heroine
,
of
course
,
be
ariel
-lrb-
voice
of
jodus
benson
-rrb-
,
a
16-year-old
mermaid
who
be
go
through
that
rebellious
phase
.
she
skip
she
concert
to
explore
a
wreck
ship
and
hang
out
with
a
seagull
that
talk
like
buddy
hackett
,
who
try
to
orient
she
to
the
mysterious
world
of
human
.
she
be
also
deal
with
feeling
she
have
not
have
before
--
which
come
when
you
get
scale
in
place
you
do
not
use
to
have
they
--
about
a
handsome
prince
-lrb-
no
disney
movie
would
be
complete
without
one
-rrb-
.
she
father
,
king
triton
of
the
merpeople
,
strictly
forbid
such
lust
after
the
way
of
the
''
savage
''
human
,
in
a
condemnation
that
read
as
a
not-so-subtle
analogy
about
old
-
fashion
parent
who
forbid
interracial
date
.
what
be
a
king
to
do
,
though
?
the
girl
's
in
love
and
even
total
destruction
of
she
little
shrine
to
the
human
world
do
not
deter
she
.
ariel
save
the
prince
's
life
when
a
hurricane
rise
up
,
and
just
have
to
meet
he
.
she
make
a
deal
with
ursulum
,
the
sea
witch
-lrb-
voice
of
pat
carroll
-rrb-
.
you
know
she
be
evil
because
she
have
a
huge
potbelly
and
one
of
the
worst
ass
in
cartoon
history
.
she
also
have
octopus
tentacle
for
foot
-lrb-
something
those
dr
.
scholl
's
corn
pad
will
not
fix
-rrb-
and
offer
to
help
ariel
out
.
she
'll
make
she
a
human
for
three
day
if
ariel
will
give
up
she
pretty
voice
;
ariel
have
three
day
to
make
that
prince
kiss
she
,
or
else
she
become
a
slave
to
the
witch
forever
.
and
if
she
prick
she
finger
on
a
sew
machine
or
eat
a
evil
apple
,
she
'll
fall
asleep
forever
.
it
be
a
simplistic
plot
,
yes
,
but
the
little
mermaid
be
a
revolution
in
the
disney
world
,
come
after
such
lackluster
effort
as
the
black
cauldron
and
oliver
and
company
.
it
rank
as
one
of
the
best
disney
cartoon
,
certainly
since
the
'50s
.
all
the
element
be
there
--
memorable
song
like
''
under
the
sea
''
and
''
kiss
the
girl
,
''
cartoon
animal
like
sebastian
and
flounder
,
a
evil
villain
who
still
have
characterization
and
charm
,
and
a
fair
amount
of
humor
that
cater
to
adult
as
well
as
child
.
the
little
mermaid
be
worth
a
big-screen
ticket
in
1997
,
so
hurry
up
,
you
only
have
five
day
leave
.
serve
america
for
more
than
1\/25th
of
a
century
!
