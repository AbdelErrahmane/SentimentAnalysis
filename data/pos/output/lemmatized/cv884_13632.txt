the
farrelly
brother
'
third
film
,
after
dumb
and
dumber
-lrb-
7
.
5\/10
-rrb-
and
kingpin
-lrb-
8\/10
-rrb-
,
bring
together
the
real-life
couple
of
cameron
diaz
and
matt
dillon
,
some
nasty
humor
,
a
cute
dog
,
and
a
mix
of
love
,
fate
and
romance
.
plot
:
high-school
nerd
ted
get
lucky
when
the
cutest
girl
in
he
class
ask
he
to
the
prom
.
unfortunately
for
ted
,
he
accidentally
get
a
part
of
he
male
anatomy
-lrb-
ouch
!
-rrb-
catch
in
he
zipper
,
and
miss
the
big
night
.
thirteen
year
later
,
ted
still
can
not
get
mary
out
of
he
mind
,
and
hire
a
private
detective
-lrb-
dillon
-rrb-
to
find
she
.
once
find
,
it
turn
out
that
mary
have
more
than
one
suitor
,
and
that
be
when
the
real
fun
begin
.
critique
:
likeable
comedy
with
a
few
extremely
funny
scene
,
some
funny
look
people
,
and
a
plot
that
will
not
ever
put
you
to
sleep
.
have
say
that
,
i
must
admit
that
i
do
like
the
farrelly
'
two
previous
film
more
than
this
one
,
but
that
be
say
a
lot
,
since
i
really
do
love
those
earlier
pic
.
this
one
be
also
quite
funny
,
but
it
do
not
really
blow
I
away
like
the
other
.
then
again
,
maybe
my
expectation
be
too
high
.
then
again
,
maybe
i
should
shut
up
,
and
write
a
little
more
about
the
film
,
and
less
about
my
suppose
subconscious
reason
for
liking\/disliking
the
film
.
continue
where
they
other
picture
leave
off
,
the
farrelly
'
create
a
cutesy
world
of
people
with
strange
and
endearing
quality
,
and
a
simple
plot
by
which
to
tie
they
all
together
.
this
one
also
include
plenty
of
toilet
humor
,
but
also
some
borderline
fun-making
of
the
disabled
and
mentally-challenged
.
i
must
admit
that
i
really
be
not
sure
whether
to
laugh
at
some
point
or
not
.
not
a
good
place
to
be
.
have
say
that
,
the
scene
that
do
tear
through
the
audience
,
and
yours
truly
,
be
extremely
hilarious
,
and
go
on
for
several
minute
after
the
punchline
.
the
laughter
practically
kill
out
the
next
scene
for
one
of
the
best
one
in
the
movie
-lrb-
something
to
do
with
hair
gel
-rrb-
.
on
the
negative
end
,
i
do
not
like
the
musical
interlude
of
jonathan
richman
that
run
through
the
entire
picture
.
i
find
they
quite
useless
,
unfunny
and
distracting
.
also
,
i
find
that
a
lot
of
the
funnier
scene
have
already
be
show
in
the
film
's
trailer
.
and
of
course
,
i
never
quite
buy
the
fact
that
these
beautiful
,
intelligent
,
single
woman
still
can
not
seem
to
find
the
''
right
guy
''
-lrb-
see
kiss
the
girl
-lrb-
7\/10
-rrb-
.
i
do
really
like
all
of
the
actor
in
the
film
,
especially
ben
stiller
,
who
appear
to
be
solidify
he
mark
as
a
great
comical
actor
with
this
picture
and
one
of
my
favorite
from
1996
,
flirt
with
disaster
-lrb-
8\/10
-rrb-
.
i
also
like
matt
dillon
with
he
big
tooth
,
and
lee
evan
with
he
superb
faux-sympathy
british
accent
.
funny
stuff
.
also
,
make
sure
that
you
stay
for
the
credit
,
because
there
be
a
entire
montage
of
outtake
from
the
film
that
play
under
a
lip-synched
version
of
''
build
I
up
buttercup
''
,
which
be
really
cool
.
overall
,
a
cute
comedy
with
a
decent
premise
,
and
a
few
particularly
hilarious
scene
.
