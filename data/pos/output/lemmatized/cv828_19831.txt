all
those
who
be
offend
by
there
be
something
about
mary
should
not
tread
in
the
water
of
american
pie
,
a
gratuitously
sexual
rollercoaster
ride
of
raunch
.
and
while
this
uproariously
funny
,
gross-out
summer
movie
be
basically
a
exercise
in
bad
taste
,
it
also
demonstrate
a
surprising
sweetness
in
the
end
.
american
pie
be
the
latest
entry
to
the
offensive
teenage-targeted
fare
this
season
.
i
must
question
the
studio
that
release
a
movie
like
this
.
the
producer
be
aim
these
film
at
the
15-24
crowd
,
but
while
push
the
limit
of
possible
sex
and
violence
in
a
r-rated
film
.
some
have
even
be
narrowly
avoid
the
dreaded
nc-17
,
a
rating
the
mpaa
give
when
the
adult
content
surpass
even
that
of
a
restricted
movie
.
american
pie
be
threaten
with
a
nc-17
,
but
after
snip
a
few
scene
from
the
finish
product
,
it
be
give
a
r
.
but
at
least
this
new
addition
be
not
as
careless
and
unforgiving
as
something
like
south
park
.
it
be
sick
,
perverse
,
and
ultimately
disgust
-
not
to
mention
extremely
funny
.
american
pie
be
about
four
desperate
teenager
who
make
a
pact
to
lose
they
virginity
by
prom
night
.

be
a
quartet
of
high
school
student
in
they
senior
year
who
think
sex
be
something
they
must
experience
to
be
successful
in
they
life
ahead
.
jim
inquire
what
it
feel
like
when
you
reach
third
base
,
to
which
one
of
he
friend
reply
:
`
like
warm
apple
pie
...
'
.
of
course
,
this
prompt
the
scene
unfairly
expose
in
the
trailer
,
in
which
jim
and
a
freshly
baked
pie
have
a
very
intimate
moment
in
the
kitchen
corner
.
there
be
many
moment
,
such
as
this
,
in
which
director
paul
weitz
use
a
game-plan
similar
to
the
one
frequently
display
in
mary
:
to
cause
the
audience
to
break
down
laughing
in
disgusting
disbelief
.
american
pie
be
a
hard-fought
effort
that
have
replenish
reward
if
you
manage
to
stick
with
it
.
i
love
the
young
cast
in
this
movie
.
consider
the
subject
matter
that
these
actor
have
deal
with
,
obviously
suggestiveness
never
rival
in
any
of
they
previous
project
,
and
you
should
appreciate
they
performance
.
bigg
be
more
than
enjoyable
,
and
chri
klein
-lrb-
who
recently
play
a
similar
jock
in
election
-rrb-
be
obviously
a
young
talent
on
the
rise
.
but
in
a
teen-dominated
movie
,
the
best
performance
come
from
comedian
eugene
levy
-lrb-
of
television
's
sctv
-rrb-
,
who
be
unexpectedly
brilliant
as
jim
's
uneasy
father
.
scene
in
which
the
familiar
father-son
conversation
be
bring
to
interesting
new
level
be
the
funniest
moment
to
be
find
in
american
pie
.
after
levy
discover
jim
's
new
use
for
apple
pie
,
he
tell
he
,
`
i
do
a
fare
share
of
that
sort
of
thing
when
i
be
you
age
.
but
i
never
use
baked
goods
.
'
it
be
performance
such
as
he
,
and
bill
murray
's
in
rushmore
,
that
be
often
unfairly
dismiss
when
award
be
hand
out
.
there
be
some
less-than-original
aspect
of
the
film
.
a
bathroom
incident
involve
finch
and
a
bottle
of
ex-lax
be
something
we
have
see
before
.
if
weitz
be
plan
to
take
after
the
farrelly
brother
,
then
this
be
a
decidedly
unwise
move
:
the
same
prank
be
pull
in
the
brother
's
dumb
and
dumber
,
and
use
to
greater
effect
.
secondly
,
the
character
be
force
into
a
half-hearted
climax
that
seem
more
artificial
than
amusing
.
but
at
one
point
,
in
which
we
discover
that
american
pie
do
have
a
heart
of
it
be
own
,
bigg
ask
he
buddy
why
he
be
go
through
so
much
pressure
for
something
that
be
`
not
very
important
anyway
.
'
and
so
we
realize
that
while
the
film
be
expressive
about
a
subject
that
be
hardly
appropriate
,
it
still
manage
to
be
mature
.
in
it
be
own
way
.
