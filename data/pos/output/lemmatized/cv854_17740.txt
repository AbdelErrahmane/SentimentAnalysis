will
chri

all
of
these
question
be
run
through
my
mind
while
watch
this
slick
suspense
film
.
the
event
in
the
curve
be
very
surprising
,
original
,
and
fun
.
the
plot
sound
much
like
dead
man
on
campus
,
but
that
be
not
the
deal
with
this
film
.
this
film
be
a
very
serious
one
,
with
not
many
laugh
.
there
be
many
twist
and
turn
that
make
this
film
different
from
most
film
.
the
end
in
particular
be
completely
unpredictable
and
satisfying
.
it
be
a
terrific
,
suspenseful
end
that
i
could
never
predict
would
happen
.
hand
down
to
dan
rosen
who
write
this
wild
ride
.
the
sound
really
stand
out
in
the
film
.
it
be
quite
eerie
and
it
really
add
to
the
feel
of
the
film
.
the
way
the
movie
be
film
be
also
great
.
all
of
the
technical
aspect
,
as
well
as
the
act
and
direct
aspect
be
very
well
do
.
the
performance
in
the
curve
be
very
good
.
matthew
lillard
get
to
play
another
creepy
role
,
just
like
in
1996
's
scream
.
-lrb-
a
+
-rrb-
he
be
very
strange
in
this
film
as
well
.
i
like
he
in
this
sort
of
role
,
rather
than
the
role
he
have
be
play
in
comedy
such
as
senseless
and
she
be
all
that
.
michael
vartan
be
fantastic
as
chri
,
who
have
extremely
mixed
emotion
about
the
entire
murder
and
the
4
.
0
.
michael
vartan
be
also
superb
in
never
be
kiss
,
where
he
co-star
with
draw
barrymore
as
a
teacher
who
fall
in
love
with
he
student
.
kerus
russell
also
give
a
great
performance
.
she
should
be
a
good
actress
in
the
horror
department
of
the
film
.
tamara
craig
thoma
be
also
realistic
,
especially
cope
with
the
death
of
she
boyfriend
.
some
very
strong
support
performance
come
from
smaller
role
,
such
as
bo
dietl
and
anthony
griffith
who
play
two
detective
investigate
the
case
.
the
bottom
line

i
might
just
have
to
curve
