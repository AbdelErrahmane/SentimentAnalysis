right
after

patch
adam
'
,
to
not
be
easily
be
sucker
by
movie
drip
with
sentimentality
.
but
darn
it
,
`
music
of
the
heart
'
be
just
layer
with
feel-good
material
and
bright
characterization
.
it
be
hard
to
dislike
a
movie
that
use
such
skill
with
it
be
manipulation
.
in
addition
,
it
be
also
a
terrific
family
film
.
this
be
the
true
story
of
violin
teacher
roberta
guasparus
,
who
fight
the
school
board
to
keep
the
musical
program
active
in
a
handful
of
inner
city
harlem
school
.
it
could
also
be
describe
as
`
mr

streep
's
opus
'
.
yes
,
meryl
streep
bring
she
dramatic
clout
to
the
demand
role
of
guasparus
,
and
that
bring
both
good
news
and
bad
.
out
of
the
gate
,
possibly
because
of
she
distracting
star
power
and
the
rush
writing
,
it
be
relatively
difficult
to
identify
with
roberta
's
character
and
grasp
she
academic
point-of-view
.
she
be
very
strict
with
she
student
,
but
what
insight
do
that
create
into
the
story
?
slowly
but
surely
,
we
begin
to
recognize
the
intention
of
the
character
,
and
show
admiration
for
the
thoughtfulness
and
human
feeling
that
streep
have
once
again
apply
.
one
thoroughly
interesting
fact
about
`
music
of
the
heart
'
lie
with
the
unlikely
presence
in
the
director
's
chair
:
horror
veteran
we
craven
.
after
leave
a
impression
with
the
`
scream
'
film
and
the
original
`
nightmare
on
elm
street
'
,
craven
have
attempt
a
precarious
cross-over
to
drama
.
at
first
,
he
inexperience
with
the
genre
be
fairly
obvious
,
but
as
the
film
progress
craven
find
a
surprisingly
comfortable
niche
with
direct
this
material
.
it
do
not
carry
the
heart-warming
courage
of

,
but

'
be
casually
assure
and
fill
with
little
morsel
of
dramatic
truth
.
the
tag
team
of
streep
and
craven
work
better
than
you
would
anticipate
.
yes
,
oscar
could
come
call
once
again
for
meryl
streep
,
but
it
be
the
solid
ensemble
cast
that
make

work
.

role
of
a
supportive
second-grade
teacher
,
and
the
three
lead
actress
together
produce
a
flaming
fireball
of
estrogenic
force
.
it
be
like
a
schoolteacher
's
version
of
`
thelma
and
louise
'
,
in
a
restrained
but
effective
manner
.
the
movie
tackle
more

a
good
movie
for
anyone
to
see
,
although
miss
out
on
the
experience
would
not
be
a
life-altering
decision
.
it
be
commendable
of
we
craven
to
be

such
a
difficult
cross-over
,
and
also
for
