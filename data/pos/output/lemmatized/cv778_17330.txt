i
want
to
correct
what
i
write
last
year
in
my
retrospective
of
david
lean
's
war
picture
.
i
still
think
that
''
the
bridge
on
the
river
kwaus
''
do
not
deserve
be
the
number
13
in
the
american
film
institute
's
list
of
the
100
greatest
american
movie
.
and
i
think
that
''
12
angry
man
''
,
''
witness
for
the
prosecution
''
and
''
path
of
glory
''
would
have
be
better
choice
for
the
oscar
for
the
best
picture
of
1957
.
but
i
can
not
deny
the
importance
of
''
the
bridge
on
the
river
kwaus
''
-
cinematically
and
in
its
contents
.
the
film
be
set
in
burma
in
1943
.
a
batallion
of
british
soldier
in
japanese
war
captivity
be
force
by
the
japanese
to
build
a
strategically
momentous
railway
bridge
over
the
river
kwaus
.
but
the
british
commanding
officer
,
colonel
nicholson
-lrb-
alec
guinness
-rrb-
,
insist
-
correspond
to
the
geneva
convention
-
that
he
officer
need
not
work
as
simple
workman
.
struggle
toughly
,
col
.
nicholson
force
the
japanese
commandant
,
col
.
saito
-lrb-
sessue
hayakawa
-rrb-
,
to
give
way
in
this
respect
.
afterwards
col
.
nicholson
assiduously
commit
himself
for
the
building
of
the
bridge
.
he
consider
it
a
opportunity
to
raise
he
man
's
morale
,
and
he
want
to
prove
superior
british
capability
to
the
japanese
.
but
the
british
high
command
send
a
few
soldier
who
shall
destroy
the
bridge
,
among
they
the
american
shears
-lrb-
william
holden
-rrb-
-
a
escapee
from
the
japanese
prison
camp
-
and
the
british
major
warden
-lrb-
jack
hawkin
-rrb-
...
a
flaw
of
the
picture
be
the
clich
?
d
characterization
of
the
japanese
people
.
they
be
present
as
if
they
be
intellectually
inferior
to
the
british
-
as
if
the
japanese
be
incapable
of
build
a
bridge
.
and
the
film
do
not
consistently
question
the
military
spirit
as
kubrick
do
in
''
path
of
glory
''
.
lean
seem
rather
fascinate
by
the
military
hierarchy
.
this
be
also
perceptible
in
the
conversation
between
col
.
nicholson
and
col
.
saito
.
in
this
regard
it
be
symptomatic
that
shears
,
who
doubt
the
military
logic
,
be
present
as
a
somehow
unpleasant
person
.
the
audience
be
suppose
to
applaud
col
.
nicholson
's
perseverance
concern
the
question
if
he
officer
shall
work
on
the
bridge
or
not
.
the
spectator
be
suppose
to
neglect
the
risk
col
.
nicholson
take
for
he
man
.
-lrb-
the
plot
by-pass
these
risk
.
-rrb-
that
mean
,
the
picture
be
not
perfect
.
but
it
have
a
lot
of
virtue
as
well
.
''
the
bridge
on
the
river
kwaus
''
show
the
''
madness
''
of
war
and
what
it
can
produce
in
people
's
mind
.
it
show
how
colonel
nicholson
become
possess
by
the
idea
of
be
a
hero
and
that
other
-lrb-
like
shears
-rrb-
get
cynic
.
and
lean
's
film
be
a
interesting
study
of
character
with
clash
interest
.
these
point
and
the
sometimes
ironic
dialogue
make
this
film
a
anti-war
film
-lrb-
despite
inconsistency
in
the
treatment
of
this
theme
-rrb-
.
david
lean
's
direction
be
really
effective
and
atmospherically
perfect
.
he
film
be
highly
suspenseful
,
especially
in
its
dramatic
-lrb-
if
not
wholly
plausible
-rrb-
showdown
.
the
film
be
also
well-photographed
and
have
a
apt
score
.
alec
guinness
do
a
magnificent
job
of
bring
col
.
nicholson
to
life
and
make
he
such
a
interesting
character
.
the
other
actor
deliver
fine
performance
as
well
.
i
like
this
extraordinary
film
despite
its
weakness
.
