26-year
old

he
purchase
a

as
many
great
movie
that
get
cult
status
through
the
year
,
taxi
driver
become
the
object
of
many
interpretation
.
for
some
critic
and
scholar
it
be
a
exploration
of
universal
subject
that
date
back
to
dostoyevskus
-
loss
of
moral
compass
in
a
bleak
reality
of
dirty
,
overpopulated
industrial
city
;
the
story
could
have
be
set
in
19th
century
same
as
in
we
time
.
for
other
,
the
movie
use
raskolnikov-like
figure
in
order
to
portray
burning
problem
of
1970s
america
-
its
apparent
inability
to
deal
with
the
consequence
of
rapid
social
change
that
occur
in
previous
decade
.
brilliant
performance
of
robert
de
niro
in
role
of
a
lifetime
can
give
argument
for
both
side
.
he
travi
bickle
have
a
lot
in
common
with
most
of
the
average
viewer
of
today
-
many
of
we
share
he
feeling
of
isolation
,
loneliness
and
outrage
towards
crime
,
drug
,
prostitution
and
senseless
street
violence
.
he
pathetic
attempt
to
establish
some
kind
of
human
connection
with
the
people
around
he
,
sometimes
in
most
unusual
circumstance
-
like
with
secret
service
agent
,
pimp
or
job
interviewer
-
make
he
a
person
too
goofy
to
be
the
hero
,
and
too
pathetic
to
be
the
classic
villain
.
however
,
most
of
the
average
viewer
be
sensible
enough
to
recognize
the
tin
line
that
separate
concerned
citizen
or
troubled
soul
from
fanatical
madman
.
but
despite
anything
,
average
viewer
at
the
end
actually
cheer
for
travi
-
he
crusade
against
''
scum
''
be
something
that
average
person
want
,
but
do
not
have
a
stomach\/lack
of
brain
to
do
it
.
while
de
niro
's
travi
might
come
in
and
out
of

time
and
place

but
only
because
he

and
therefore
everybody
assume
that
he
''

''
.
he
obvious

the

the
element

even
the
politician
,
like

,
be
lose
in

;
he
broad
and
senseless
''
message
''
that
cover
the
lack
of
any
serious
program
can
not
fool
even
such
idiot
like
travi
.
the
past
be
go
,
the
present
be
bad

and
even
the
future
seem
bleak
,
and
the
feeling
of
pessimism
can
not
be
wash
away
even
by
ironic
happy
end
.
travi
and
he
world
find
themselves
in
a
desperate
situation
,
and
martin
scorsese
use
the
best
of
he
cinematic
skill
in
order
to
spill
the
gloom
of
schrader
's
screenplay
into
the
silver
screen
.

portray
as
a
hell
on
earth
,
and
the
red
light
and
steam
come
out
of

give
it
surreal
,
almost
stygian
atmosphere
.
another
important
element
of
the
atmosphere
be
score
of
great
bernard
herrman
,
whose
efficient
use
of
jazz
element
give
some
melancholy
that
soften
the
brutality
of

.
one
of
the
greatest
irony
of
taxi
driver
be
the
fact
that
the
movie
be
,
same
as
he
protagonist
,
famous
for
the
wrong
reason
.
instead
of
receive
cult
status
because
of

artistic
merit
,
for
many
year
it
be
tabloid-fodder
because
of

and
he
real-life

in

now

more
than

when
