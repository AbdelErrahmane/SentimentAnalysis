i
think
the
first
thing
this
reviewer
should
mention
be
wether
or
not
i
be
a
fan
of
the
x-files
.
first
,
let
I
assure
you
that
no
prior
experience
with
the
series
be
require
to
fully
enjoy
this
movie
.
the
producer
be
not
stupid
,
make
a
movie
just
for
fan
of
the
series
be
not
profitable
.
you
have
to
reach
for
a
larger
audience
.
therefore
,
the
movie
be
quite
user-friendly
.
altough
,
non-fan
will
only
fail
to
understand
certain
emotion
behind
the
look
many
character
exchange
.
but
fear
not
,
duchovny
and
another
man
later
on
provide
more
than
adequate
background
info
on
what
be
go
on
.
you
will
never
feel
as
if
you
just
walk
in
on
the
third
act
of
some
great
opera
.
in
any
case
,
the
answer
be
no
.
i
be
not
a
fan
of
the
x-files
,
i
only
watch
it
when
nothing
else
be
on
and
i
prefer
millennium
.
however
,
since
the
fox
network
as
be
so
kind
as
to
air
several
key
episode
for
several
week
before
the
movie
's
opening
weekend
i
take
that
opportunity
to
test
the
movie
.
i
tape
all
of
these
episode
and
watch
they
only
after
see
the
movie
,
i
be
glad
to
report
that
i
learn
nothing
new
.
everything
you
need
to
know
be
explain
to
the
viewer
by
duchovny
and
other
.
i
know
i
be
go
maybe
a
bit
too
far
to
make
my
point
but
everybody
should
get
the
chance
to
experience
this
movie
.
warning
:
major
spoiler
follow
!
please
do
not
read
to
fully
enjoy
this
movie
,
you
must
not
be
able
know
what
be
come
,
what
exactly
be
over
that
hill
and
what
that
weird
''
hummm
''
sound
be
all
about
.
you
have
be
warn
.
the
x-files
be
what
a
summer
should
be
.
exciting
,
scary
,
great
special
effect
-lrb-
unlike
other
summer
movie
the
effect
do
not
take
over
the
movie
and
be
only
there
when
it
be
really
necessary
-rrb-
and
good
performance
.
this
be
come
from
a
guy
who
think
david
duchovny
be
the
human
equivalent
of
a
wooden
plank
.
from
start
to
finish
,
this
movie
do
not
let
go
of
you
.
when
i
compare
it
with
last
summer
's
movie
the
best
way
to
describe
it
would
be
:
take
the
excitement
and
great
score
from
face\/off
and
the
deadly
use
of
sound
from
event
horizon
.
this
flick
be
scary
,
not
in
a
b
movie
kind
of
way
where
you
always
know
where
and
when
the
critter
will
jump
at
we
hero
.
in
fact
,
the
first
time
the
critter
in
this
movie
make
a
apperance
it
be
totally
out
of
the
blue
.
you
might
as
well
bring
ear
plug
because
this
thing
be
louuuudd
!
the
last
time
a
monster
scare
I
that
much
be
when
i
first
saw
alien
as
a
six
year
old
kid
.
you
know
,
when
you
be
affraid
to
put
you
foot
on
the
floor
because
the
creature
might
be
under
the
chair
,
or
when
you
keep
try
to
cover
you
throat
with
you
shirt
?
so
yeah
,
the
x-files
be
scary
.
and
guess
what
?
you
never
even
have
to
see
the
monster
but
you
imagination
work
overtime
and
it
sure
beat
have
to
watch
a
flaw
,
computer
generate
,
babyzillum
,
it
look
like
you
could
walk
right
through
it
not
even
scarier
than
you
grandma
in
undies
type
of
monster
.
do
not
think
that
the
x-files
be
a
monster
movie
.
in
fact
,
the
creature
be
there
for
maybe
three
minute
total
.
no
,
the
x-files
be
definately
a
mulder
episode
of
the
series
.
scully
be
at
he
side
,
of
course
,
but
gillian
anderson
get
maybe
half
the
screen
time
.
she
have
a
couple
of
good
scene
with
duchovny
,
but
she
get
kidnap
during
the
last
half
hour
of
the
movie
so
she
do
not
get
to
do
much
.
no
,
this
be
mulder
's
time
in
the
spotlight
.
by
now
,
you
have
hear
of
the
scene
where
mulder
''
shower
''
independence
day
.
if
you
have
not
then
i
will
not
spoil
it
for
you
,
let
's
just
say
that
due
to
recent
event
mulder
should
be
''
shower
''
godzillum
instead
.
to
those
of
you
wonder
if
mulder
discover
that
the
truth
be
indeed
out
there
...
who
care
!
?
if
he
do
find
it
the
series
would
over
anyway
so
what
be
you
complain
about
?
the
dialogue
in
interesting
and
the
director
be
marvelous
.
the
camera
be
almost
always
look
over
the
shoulder
of
we
hero
so
we
feel
as
if
we
be
right
there
with
they
when
they
open
a
door
or
climb
a
hill
.
the
script
be
spotless
,
every
thing
that
happen
happen
for
a
purpose
.
if
you
be
confuse
by
something
,
do
not
worry
because
it
will
all
become
clear
later
on
but
,
and
i
can
not
stress
this
enough
,
pay
attention
!
!
!
unlike
most
summer
movie
,
the
dialogue
be
twice
as
important
as
the
effect
.
miss
one
vital
piece
of
information
and
,
like
most
people
who
talk
during
movie
,
you
will
go
home
and
tell
all
you
friend
how
this
movie
make
no
sense
.
also
,
to
those
people
who
need
to
go
to
the
bathroom
during
movie
...
do
not
!
the
person
who
watch
the
movie
with
I
have
to
go
twice
and
twice
she
miss
a
important
conversation
.
there
be
no
time
to
take
a
breather
between
scene
because
,
again
unlike
most
summer
movie
-lrb-
godzillum
anybody
?
-rrb-
the
x-files
do
not
need
to
fill
scene
between
the
suspense
and
the
action
with
useless
subplot
,
every
scene
be
crucial
and
serve
a
purpose
.
who
need
to
see
the
blond
chiouaoua
have
a
''
big
emotional
scene
''
between
godzillum
attack
?
so
far
this
summer
i
have
see
only
one
movie
who
rank
higher
on
my
list
of
movie
i
would
recommend
and
that
be
the
truman
show
but
it
only
win
by
a
nose
.
but
the
truman
show
be
not
what
i
would
call
a
summer
movie
,
the
x-files
be
.
what
more
do
you
ask
from
a
summer
movie
other
than
the
chance
to
be
excite
?
cool
effect
?
it
be
get
some
.
pulse
pound
?
hell
yes
!
strangely
enough
,
i
think
that
fan
of
the
series
will
hate
this
movie
while
non-fan
will
have
a
good
time
.
it
do
not
provide
answer
to
the
show
's
many
question
,
the
status
quo
remain
nearly
the
same
and
,
no
,
mulder
and
scully
do
not
get
together
.
rating
:
four
and
a
half
out
of
five
star
for
the
best
movie
yet
this
summer
,
several
jump
right
out
of
you
seat
thrill
,
many
''
whoah
,
i
never
see
that
one
come
!
''
moment
,
four
''
holy
shit
,
where
the
hell
do
that
come
from
''
and
one
heck
of
a
end
.
you
may
wonder
where
this
movie
lose
half
a
star
.
well
,
i
swear
never
to
give
a
movie
the
full
five
star
so
i
have
to
find
something
about
the
in
he
ice
truck
,
the
track
it
leave
in
the
snow
behind
he
go
on
for
several
mile
but
then
they
just
stop
.
it
be
pretty
obvious
the
film
's
maker
drive
the
truck
for
several
mile
to
give
the
appearance
that
mulder
have
be
drive
for
a
long
time
,
but
in
the
end
it
look
like
mulder
just
drop
from
the
sky
and
start
drive
.
