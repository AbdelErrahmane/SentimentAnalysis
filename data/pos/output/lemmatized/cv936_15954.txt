it
be
tough
to
really
say
something
nice
about
a
type
of
person
who
be
so
ethnocentric
that
any
humanity
they
once
have
be
now
go
,
but
by
god
,
''
american
history
x
''
do
it
,
and
for
that
,
i
commend
it
.
it
not
only
take
ball
but
intelligence
to
make
a
human
be
out
of
a
neo-nazi
skinhead
,
a
kind
of
person
who
dedicate
they
life
to
hate
anyone
who
be
not
what
they
be
,
and
this
film
wisely
and
miracurously
pull
it
off
.
the
subject
of
this
film
be
one
of
they
,
but
he
be
worse
than
one
of
the
blind
follower
that
make
up
most
skinhead
member
since
he
be
the
leader
of
the
pack
.
he
be
the
one
who
instigate
they
to
take
a
firm
grip
onto
they
rage
,
and
then
in
another
brilliant
stroke
,
justify
it
with
political
propoganda
that
make
eerie
sense
when
he
speak
.
he
be
so
utterly
convincing
as
a
public
speaker
and
so
firm
in
he
conviction
that
it
come
as
a
shock
when
he
actually
go
through
the
rehabilitation
process
.
he
name
be
derek
vinyard
,
and
he
be
play
by
edward
norton
with
so
much
fire
and
intensity
that
when
he
speak
he
be
almost
as
convincing
and
arrest
a
public
speaker
as
,
say
,
malcom
x
.
when
we
first
see
he
,
he
be
clean
shaven
,
with
a
jet
black
swastica
emrboider
on
he
left
breast
,
a
devlish
goatee
,
and
he
be
attack
the
black
carjacker
outside
of
he
house
dress
in
nothing
but
he
white
boxer
and
carry
a
handgun
in
he
hand
that
never
seem
to
run
out
of
bullet
,
at
least
when
he
do
not
need
they
.
he
so
believe
in
he
conviction
that
he
be
willing
to
put
he
belief
to
the
test
,
even
if
he
know
it
will
mean
a
stop
in
prison
,
if
only
for
a
couple
year
.

be
about

how

after
murder
two
black

in
a
fit
of
rage

be
less
to

how

he
younger

we
see
he
at
all
of
these
stage
-
as
a
smart
teenager

a
vicious
hate
monger
,
a
man
have
a

the
man
who
try

before

and
in
all
of
these
,
we
get
a
portrait
of
a
man
from
all
side
.
or
at

,
that
be
the
intention

coincidentally
,
this
day
be
the
day
derek
be
release
from
prison
,
and
when
we
see
he
,
he
be
cleaned-up
,
not
as
buff
,
and
have
a
full
head
of
hair
.
he
be
just
as
intelligent
,
but
still
very
rough
along
the
edge
,
but
he
be
wisen
up
.
he
be
no
longer
control
by
he
anger
at
black
and

,
and
try
to
persuade
danny
,
who
be
become
what
derek
be
before

to
give
up

danny
will
not

large
skinhead

,
meet
with
the
skinhead
leader

,
and
then
discover
that
derek
be
as
oppose
to
neo-nazi-dom
as
he
be
for
it
a
couple
of
year
ago
.
the
film
circle
around
this
,
then
spin
off
into
non-linear
flashback
,
all
do
in
black
and
white
.
we
mostly
see
derek
at
he
prime
as
a
skinhead
,
live
in
venice
beach
,
organize
vicious
and
quasi-sadistic
raid
on
local
store
that
no
longer
hire
the
white
,
middle-class
teenager
since
they
can
easily
get
cheaper
illegal
immigrant
to
do
the
same
work
,
and
mouth
off
he
theory
on
affirmative

and
how
illegal

have
destroy
the
fundamental
this

to
they
,
the
white
man
be
the
one
who
have
get
the
fuzzy
end
of
the
lolipop
,
and
he
not
only
speak
elloquently
,
forcefully
,
and
intelligently
,
but
he
back
everything
up
with
political
reason
,
justify
they
rage
at
least
to
they
.
and
frighteningly
enough
,
much
of
what
he
say
sound
true
.
''
american
history
x
''
be
a
collection
of
really
great
scene
and
moment
,
rather
than
a
cohesive
,
great
film
that
flow
effortlessly
from
one
moment
to
the
next
.
in
it
,
there
be
some
of
the
best
scene
i
have
see
all
year
.
one
scene
feature
a
dinner
between
derek
's
family
,
and
he
mother
's
newest
boyfriend
-lrb-
play
with
reserve
by
eliott
gould
-rrb-
,
a
jewish
liberal
who
quietly
disagree
with
derek
's
rightist
view
,
launch
the
scene
into
a
fit
of
rage
and
anger
that
build
unparalled
emotion
in
the
audience
-lrb-
gould
's
reaction
to
derek
's
final
summation
be
unnerrve
-rrb-
.
another
scene
use
humor
and
traditional
macho
sex
talk
to
build
a
friendship
and
a
nice
connection
between
derek
and
a
black
co-worker
-lrb-
guy
torry
-rrb-
while
folding
laundry
in
prison
.
and
another
soon-to-be-classic
be
actually
divide
in
two
:
the
murder
of
the
two
black
man
that
wind
derek
in
jail
,
which
contain
a
final
murder
so
nasty
that
it
may
be
the
most
revoltingly
shocking
all
year
.
there
be
much
more
to
appreciate
,
like
the
acting
,
which
be
uniformly
good
,
with
stand-out
come
from
avery
brook
,
beverly
d'angelo
-lrb-
as
the
long-suffering
mother
-rrb-
,
and
gould
-lrb-
who
have
one
horrible
line
,
but
other
than
that
,
come
off
with
the
best
performance
he
be
give
in
what
seem
like
a
really
long
time
-rrb-
.
norton
walk
off
with
the
film
,
though
,
come
off
with
such
intensity
that
he
reduce
anyone
not
do
a
adequate
job
to
rubble
.
in
only
the
fifth
movie
of
he
career
,
norton
have
invent
himself
as
one
of
the
most
reliable
and
intense
actor
of
he
generation
,
and
maybe
the
best
.
there
be
nothing
like
it
when
norton
really
get
rolling
in
this
movie
,
spew
out
line
with
such
authority
that
he
command
all
attention
from
the
audience
,
come
off
with
power
similar
to
that
of
a
young
maron
brando
.
that
he
allow
the
little
emotion
to
seep
through
be
amazing
.
sadly
enough
,
this
be
not
go
to
be
the
great
portrait
of
racism
that
it
perhaps
hope
to
be
.
it
be
too
unambitious
and
even
a
little
contrived
to
really
take
off
as
either
a
powerful
statement
or
a
emotional
masterpiece
.
the
end
,
especially
,
be
pencil
in
from
other
movie
,
toss
in
just
so
the
emotional
keyboard
can
be
trounce
upon
.
some
of
the
skinhead
be
reduce
to
mere
cliche
-lrb-
kevin
smith
regular
ethan
suplee
fair
rather
annoyingly
as
the
''
fat
skinhead
,
''
whose
line
consist
without
fail
of
express
he
desire
to
eat
more
-rrb-
,
and
even
the
dramatic
arc
be
not
as
well
travel
.
furlong
's
danny
never
seem
to
really
be
learn
a
lesson
,
since
the
flashback
refuse
to
show
he
point
of
view
,
and
when
he
decide
to
make
a
change
by
the
end
-lrb-
which
be
inevitable
-rrb-
,
it
do
not
seem
like
it
have
actually
arrive
there
.
even
derek
's
descent
into
skinhead-dom
do
not
seem
justified
.
though
he
fireman
father
-lrb-
william
russ
,
the
dad
from
''
boy
meet
world
,
''
and
do
not
ask
I
how
i
know
that
-rrb-
be
kill
by
a
black
junkie
,
and
even
before
he
speak
against
affirmative
action
intelligently
,
there
never
seem
to
be
any
real
back
story
why
derek
become
so
intense
about
he
belief
.
as
such
,
one
can
see
why
the
director
,
tony
kaye
,
want
to
have
he
name
remove
.
sorta
.
''
american
history
x
''
be
a
very
good
movie
,
and
i
be
very
move
by
it
,
but
it
could
be
a
lot
better
,
and
the
problem
seem
to
be
that
the
cut
as
it
be
be
not
up
to
what
he
claim
to
be
he
potential
.
somewhere
,
he
claim
,
there
lie
a
tony
kaye
cut
,
and
that
be
to
be
the
true
cut
until
it
be
view
by
norton
,
who
then
order
another
cut
,
and
that
be
thus
.
although
he
aim
for
the
direct
credit
to
go
to
''
alan
smithee
,
''
the
resident
name
for
any
film
that
be
to
be
disown
by
its
director
,
it
be
not
allow
to
he
,
under
the
grounds
that
once
you
disown
a
film
,
you
can
not
badmouth
it
-lrb-
but
really
,
that
be
the
macguffin
-
no
one
really
want
a
film
this
good
to
be
give
the
alan
smithee
sign
of
disapproval
-rrb-
.
kaye
's
right
in
that
it
be
not
up
to
par
,
even
if
he
be
not
refer
to
normal
par
but
rather
he
own
personal
par
.
this
will
not
be
a
''
do
the
right
thing
''
for
the
late
90
.
yet
it
still
get
its
point
across
intelligently
,
and
back
it
up
with
its
story
-lrb-
its
message
,
that
one
can
not
be
so
enwrap
in
one
's
own
belief
or
pain
and
suffering
will
occur
,
be
literally
say
over
the
narration
,
unfortunately
-rrb-
.
and
even
if
it
be
not
perfect
,
at
least
when
avery
brook
turn
to
norton
after
he
have
be
beat
and
rape
in
prison
,
and
ask
he
if
anything
he
be
do
have
make
he
life
any
better
,
it
realy
hit
a
nerve
,
not
only
in
derek
,
but
also
in
the
audience
.
