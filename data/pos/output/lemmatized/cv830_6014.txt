while
set
several
decade
ago
,
this
story
remain
completely
relevant
in
today
's
society
,
where
abused

and
abuse
commit

routinely

the
real
star
of
this
domestic
drama
be
not
top-billed
jennifer
jason
leigh
,
but
child
actress
jena
malone
,
who
play
bone
in
a
wrenching
and
wholly
impressive
debut
performance
.
she
work
be
of
award-calibre
,
and
in

in

a

leigh
's
performance
in
bastard
out
of
carolina
be
fine
,
although
she
be
not
really
give
much
to
do
,
and
ron

work
be
very
solid
,
skillfully
manouver
he
character
's
mood

explosive
rage

one
can
always
sense
that
underneath

.
of
the
support
cast
,
special
note
must
be
make
of
the
criminally
underrated
michael
rooker
's
performance
.
there
be
a
bit
too
much
generic
formulaism
in
the
screenplay
for
my
taste
,
from
the
various
character
spout
off
country
bumpkinism
,
to
the
familiar
sight
of
a
dried-up
uptight
wise
old

suit
for
a
stage
performance
.
still
,
it
can
not
be
deny
that
anne
meredith
's
screenplay
contain
a
wallop
of
emotional
power
.
huston
's
direction
of
the
film
be
surehanded
and
impressive
,
give
the
film
good
pacing
and
elicit
good
performance
from
she
cast
,
particularly
the
young
malone
.
she
sequence
of
child
abuse
be
shoot
in
a
hard-hitting
emotional
,
rather
than
graphic
,
manner
,
and
be
very
effective
.
huston
's
talent
with
camera
positioning
be
wonderful
,
from
a
visually
striking
shot
do
through
a
fan
,
to
a
extended
sequence
in
the
front
seat
of
a
automobile
.
the
film
have
the
toned-down
feel
of
a
television
production
;
bastard
out
of
carolina
be
originally
compose
and
cut
for
broadcast
on
the
tnt
cable
station
,
who
end
up
decline
the
film
due
to
sentiment
that
scene
of
abuse
and
rape
in
the
film
be
too
disturbingly
realistic
for
they
audience
.
perhaps
some
sequence
of
the
film
may
be
unpleasant
,
but
as
a
whole
bastard
out
of
carolina
add
up
to
a
powerful
viewer
experience
worth
see
.
