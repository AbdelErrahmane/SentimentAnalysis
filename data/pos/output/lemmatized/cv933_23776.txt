-rrb-
.
they
offer
he
another
life
,
as

celebrity
--
a
toy
in

love
intensively
by

little
while

before
he
grow
up
-rrb-
and

forget
,
or
be
admire

the
problem
be
,
if

escape
from
al
's
clutch
and
return
home
,
they
will
end
up
back
in
the
lonely
darkness
of
storage
.
a
real
effort
be
make
in
the
technical
department
.
the
animation
be
rich
and
colorful
,
with
lot
of
wonderful
detail
.
the
''
cinematography
''
be
also
extremely
improve
since
toy
story
;
there
be
a
lot
of
complicated
swing
,
turn
and
close-up
that
really
make
a
impression
.
lighting
and
filter
be
use
to
create
a
mood
-lrb-
as
in
a
surprisingly
emotional
moment
-
jessie
's
remembrance
of
she
day
when
she
be
a
beloved
toy
-rrb-
the
film
contain
a
lot
of
in-side
joke
-lrb-
such
as
the
one
about
videogame
-rrb-
,
and
entertaining
parody
on
''
jurassic
park
''
and
''
star
war
''
.
the
film
end
with
the
''
fail
take
''
,
the
kind
of
scene
that
we
be
use
to
see
after
comedy
show
on
tv
.
these
outtake
be
some
of
the
funniest
scene
in
the
film
.
but
what
in
the
end
make
''
toy
story
2
''
a
memorable
experience
be
not
the
joke
,
its
multiple
parody
or
marvelous
animation
.
it
be
its
heart
and
emotion
--
the
story
about
the
meaning
of
friendship
,
love
and
even
life
itself
.
it
be
not
difficult
to
predict
that
''
toy
story
2
''
would
be
a
huge
economical
success
,
but
its
artistic
achievement
be
unexpected
.
unexpected
because
the
first
film
be
not
much
more
than
a
demonstration
of
special
effect
.
but
mostly
it
be
unexpected
because
disney
have
not
produce
anything
spectacular
in
year
and
be
constantly
surpass
by
company
such
as
dreamwork
and
warner
br
.
but
here
the
director
have
change
the
atmosphere
of
the
film
,
make
it
more
accessible
and
interesting
for
person
older
that
9
year
.
this
be
a
big
step-away
from
the
ancient
law
of
disney-animation
.
off
course
,
this
be
not
''
antz
''
,
it
be
not
as
intelligent
;
this
be
not
a
landmark
and
no
masterpiece
,
but
i
promise
that
you
'll
find
it
as
funny
and
enjoyable
as
i
have
.
whether
this
be
the
best
animated
film
of
the
year
,
i
dare
not
say
.
my
choice
would
probably
be
''
the
iron
giant
''
,
but
-lrb-
along
side
with
''
american
pie
''
-rrb-
this
be
the
comedy
of
the
year
.
i
almost
lose
my
hope
for
disney
,
but
''
toy
story
2
''
prove
that
disney
have
not
lose
they
ability
to
entertain
.
