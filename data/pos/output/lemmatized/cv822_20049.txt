after
the
terminally
bleak
reservoir
dog
and
the
brutally
violent
pulp
fiction
,
jackie
brown
seem
like
something
of
a
light-hearted
departure
for
quentin
tarantino
.
it
be
more
of
a
ho-hum
heist
story
with
character
that
speak
the
tarantino
language
.
luckily
,
he
showcase
of
actor
convert
every
morsel
of
possible
enjoyment
onto
the
screen
,
and
jackie
brown
have
no
trouble
entertain
the
average
viewer
.
the
story
introduce
we
to
a
street-wise
black
woman
name
jackie
brown
-lrb-
pam
grier
-rrb-
,
a
flight
attendant
who
smuggle
money
and
drug
from
one
destination
to
another
.
she
work
for
a
bottom-of-the-barrel
airline
and
receive
a
minimal
salary
.
but
one
day
,
she
be
pick
up
by
a
pair
of
federal
official
-lrb-
include
michael
keaton
as
the
tough-nosed
ray
nicolet
-rrb-
,
and
find
with
a
handsome
load
of
cash
and
a
small
bag
of
smuggled
dope
.
jackie
be
work
for
a
weapon
dealer
name
ordell
-lrb-
samuel
l
.
jackson
-rrb-
,
who
pay
she
bail
money
but
suspect
she
of
tip
off
the
fed
about
they
operation
.
soon
jackie
and
ordell
be
plot
a
way
to
smuggle
$
500
,
000
through
to
they
under
nicolet
's
nose
,
with
the
help
of
ordell
's
oaf
of
a
partner
-lrb-
robert
de
niro
-rrb-
and
drugged-out
lady
friend
-lrb-
bridget
fonda
-rrb-
.
also
enter
the
picture
be
a
bail-bondsman
name
max
cherry
-lrb-
robert
forster
-rrb-
,
who
take
a
liking
to
jackie
and
agree
at
one
point
to
make
the
situation
even
more
complicated
-lrb-
how
i
will
not
say
-rrb-
.
the
big
drop-off
be
undoubtedly
the
high
point
of
jackie
brown
,
in
which
numerous
double-cross
take
place
and
many
clothing
store
bag
-lrb-
fill
with
cash
-rrb-
switch
hand
.
it
be
unfortunate
that
tarantino
take
he
sweet
time
get
there
,
and
do
not
offer
anything
extremely
compelling
while
do
so
.
there
be
,
as
always
,
amusing
exchange
between
character
.
the
funniest
repartee
be
between
de
niro
and
fonda
,
as
he
become
annoyed
with
she
constant
bickering
while
make
fun
of
he
iq
,
or
lack
thereof
.
the
most
interesting
relationship
be
between
max
and
jackie
.
a
56-year
old
white
bail
bondsman
and
a
44-year
old
black
flight
attendant
with
believable
chemistry
?
you
have
get
to
commend
the
acting
.
jackie
brown
be
a
seriously
dragged-out
exercise
enliven
by
such
fine
acting
.
the
film
clock
in
at
a
lengthy
2
hour
,
35
minute
.
tarantino
's
talky
style
manage
to
hold
you
attention
heavily
,
but
there
be
more
than
a
few
dramatic
lapse
and
crucial
lull
in
the
storyline
.
also
,
fan
of
the
director
should
be
prepare
for
a
lighter
side
to
appear
.
jackie
brown
have
four
major
shooting
,
and
two
of
those
take
place
mostly
off-screen
,
so
do
not
be
expect
a
typical
tarantino
bloodbath
.
you
can
expect
frequent
foul
language
,
mostly
come
way
of
ordell
,
who
-lrb-
much
to
the
dismay
of
spike
lee
-rrb-
use
the
`
n
'
word
as
part
of
he
regular
vocabulary
.
the
acting
be
the
glue
that
hold
everything
together
.
grier
,
make
a
sudden
comeback
from
she
reign
in
the
1970
's
,
be
more
than
adequate
for
the
title
character
.
in
fact
,
she
be
flat-out
great
.
another
comeback
come
from
former
tv
star
robert
forster
,
who
do
a
grand
job
as
max
cherry
,
and
be
perfectly
cast
in
do
so
.
michael
keaton
make
he
presence
feel
,
albeit
in
small
but
dignified
moment
,
and
de
niro
be
ideal
in
play
the
lug-head
who
go
over
the
edge
.
speaking
of
that
,
bridget
fonda
have
relatively
little
to
do
as
ordell
's
bikini-clad
beach
babe
,
and
yet
she
manage
to
look
fairly
occupy
.
there
be
not
a
single
sign
of
misplace
dialogue
or
snub
line
throughout
the
entire
movie
.
which
be
a
life-saver
for
mr
.
tarantino
.
the
story
barely
hold
together
in
the
meantime
,
and
we
merely
get
a
small
tremor
whenever
there
should
be
a
defeaning
earthquake
.
but
oh
well
.
jackie
brown
manage
to
be
a
enjoyable
detour
from
quentin
tarantino
,
even
if
it
be
lack
the
glaring
and
original
bite
of
he
previous
work
.
let
's
just
hope
that
the
director
have
not
go
soft
on
we
.
