when
i
be
ask
to
see
this
movie
with
a
friend
,
my
initial
reaction
be
?
not
hugh
grant
!
'
i
be
perhaps
wrong
to
be
so
harsh
,
but
after
he
insidious
flirtation
with
a
street
hooker
,
i
just
could
not
picture
he
in
any
romantic
lead
.
what
make
this
movie
a
wonderful
experience
be
not
the
fact
it
star
hugh
,
but
because
it
star
julium
and
carry
with
it
a
brilliantly
write
script
.
this
writer
richard
curti
,
whose
exceptional
first
work
?
four
wedding
and
funeral
'
show
we
that
he
be
a
master
in
the
domain
of
the
romantic
comedy
,
with
splash
of
drama
throw
in
between
.
hugh
and
he
hair
,
be
almost
identical
to
the
character
that
make
he
famous
in
?
four
wedding
'
.
he
play
a
ordinary
guy
who
be
down
and
out
on
he
luck
.
unfortunately
,
he
be
type
cast
in
this
role
,
but
fortunately
it
work
well
for
he
in
this
movie
.
if
only
he
would
dither
a
little
less
.
julium
know
this
role
well
.
the
glamorous
movie
star
who
be
search
for
true
love
.
there
be
moment
in
this
movie
,
that
you
almost
weep
for
she
pain
feel
loneliness
.
how
sad
it
must
be
to
be
so
wealthy
and
beautiful
,
but
to
have
no
one
to
share
it
with
.
the
writer
deal
with
difficult
issue
of
love
and
social
class
on
various
level
.
how
difference
in
social
standing
can
make
it
almost
impossible
for
love
to
grow
in
such
a
harsh
environment
.
how
the
media
can
be
as
cruel
as
it
can
be
attentive
,
and
how
fulfilment
in
life
and
love
can
be
find
in
forgiveness
and
sacrifice
.
