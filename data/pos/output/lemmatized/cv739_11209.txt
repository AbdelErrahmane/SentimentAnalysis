you
know
you
be
in
for
a
truly
different
cinematic
experience
the
moment
you
realize
steve
buscemus
have
be
cast
as
the
movie
in
question
's
most
normal
character
.
such
be
the
case
with
''
the
big
lebowskus
,
''
joel
and
ethan
coen
's
first
venture
since
they
''
fargo
''
nab
nationwide
acclaim
and
a
mantlepiece
of
academy
award
nod
.
there
be
no
need
to
fear
that
the
coen
suffer
creative
burnout
with
that
accomplishment
,
because
''
lebowskus
''
be
a
effort
that
make
word
like
''
strange
''
and
''
unusual
''
seem
like
a
understatement
.
thanks
in
part
to
delicious
characterization
and
a
all-encompassing
sense
of
humor
,
the
film
be
a
smashing
success
.
the
central
oddball
here
be
the
dude
-lrb-
jeff
bridge
-rrb-
,
a
unemployed
cad
whose
ambition
appear
to
be
zilch
beyond
smoking
pot
,
drinking
beer
and
go
bowling
-lrb-
be
you
college
student
already
root
for
he
,
or
what
?
-rrb-
.
one
night
,
a
pair
of
thug
break
into
he
house
and
pee
on
he
carpet
,
a
threatening
act
that
be
suppose
to
be
carry
out
against
a
famous
pasadena
millionaire
-lrb-
david
huddleston
-rrb-
who
share
he
birth
name
--
jeff
lebowskus
--
with
the
dude
.
once
the
dude
realize
this
coincidence
,
he
visit
the
big
lebowskus
in
hope
to
claim
reparation
for
he
soil
rug
,
and
be
back
to
he
normal
life
with
alley
pal
walter
-lrb-
john
goodman
-rrb-
,
a
hotheaded
vietnam
vet
,
and
donny
-lrb-
buscemus
-rrb-
,
a
mild-mannered
surfer
,
before
too
long
.
soon
,
though
,
lebowskus
's
trampy
trophy
wife
bunny
-lrb-
tara
reid
-rrb-
be
kidnap
and
hold
for
a
hefty
ransom
,
and
he
turn
to
the
dude
for
help
.
it
seem
bunny
's
trouble
be
related
to
a
line
of
work
she
be
keep
secret
from
she
husband
--
she
be
actually
a
adult
film
star
and
be
very
in
debt
with
a
shady
producer
name
jackie
treehorn
.
the
dude
,
now
on
lebowskus
's
payroll
,
accept
the
offer
and
agree
to
handle
the
money
drop
;
walter
tag
along
and
insist
that
the
dude
keep
the
cash
for
himself
.
chaos
obviously
ensue
,
and
the
dude
eventually
find
himself
in
hot
water
with
cop
,
crook
and
lebowskus
's
ultra-eccentric
artist
daughter
maude
-lrb-
julianne
moore
-rrb-
.
''
the
big
lebowskus
''
deserve
to
win
the
coen
the
same
amount
of
acclaim
that
''
fargo
''
do
;
while
that
1996
black
comedy
be
certainly
a
better
film
,
''
lebowskus
''
be
at
least
as
breathtakingly
imaginative
.
the
movie
boast
a
mile-high
absurdity
level
that
sometimes
threaten
to
topple
over
,
but
thankfully
never
do
.
the
coen
-lrb-
joel
direct
,
ethan
produce
and
both
write
-rrb-
keep
you
in
stitch
as
they
unravel
they
exceedingly
loopy
tale
,
and
must
be
commend
for
juggle
a
number
of
people
and
subplot
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
robert
altman
flick
.
whether
we
be
watch
bridge
fend
off
a
marmet
in
he
bathtub
or
moore
don
vike
dud
and
dance
in
a
busby
berkeley-esque
dream
sequence
,
''
the
big
lebowskus
''
be
immensely
lively
.
there
be
those
who
will
dislike
this
film
,
but
not
because
it
be
boring
.
the
cast
have
a
great
deal
of
fun
with
the
bounteous
material
they
be
give
.
bridge
exude
a
likeable
,
surprisingly
sweet
presence
;
he
dude
sure
be
not
the
cleanest
guy
around
,
but
you
would
still
follow
he
to
another
movie
.
goodman
merit
1998
's
first
oscar
consideration
,
as
walter
's
manic
temper
be
one
of
''
the
big
lebowskus
''
's
many
highlight
;
the
same
go
for
moore
,
whose
throaty
,
delectable
performance
as
maude
be
a
hilarious
hoot
.
john
turturro
may
very
well
steal
the
movie
with
he
two
scene
as
a
colorful
bowler
from
a
rival
faction
.
sam
elliott
's
rambling
narration
get
the
film
off
to
a
solid
start
.
and
some
will
recognize
peter
stormare
--
''
fargo
''
's
silent
heavy
--
as
carl
hungus
,
a
porn
star
who
be
really
a
samurai
sword-wielding
german
nihilist
and
has-been
pop
star
.
only
in
its
final
third
do
the
movie
falter
,
with
a
couple
of
loose
plot
thread
and
some
cast
member
who
quickly
disappear
and
never
emerge
for
a
curtain
call
.
these
flaw
be
forgivable
,
though
--
the
coen
have
craft
a
tale
so
rich
with
personality
that
it
be
hard
to
look
at
the
final
product
with
anything
but
a
big
grin
on
you
face
.
without
a
doubt
,
''
the
big
lebowskus
''
be
the
best
film
so
far
this
year
.
sure
,
we
be
only
three
month
in
and
the
competition
-lrb-
''
deep
rise
,
''
''
desperate
measure
,
''
''
the
wedding
singer
,
''
etc
.
-rrb-
have
be
pretty
bland
,
but
it
be
still
the
gospel
truth
.
maybe
during
next
award
season
,
''
lebowskus
''
will
not
be
a
far
cry
from
''
fargo
.
''
