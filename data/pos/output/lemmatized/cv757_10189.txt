scream
2
have
a
titillating
little
scene
that
lay
down
the
unwritten
law
of
horror
movie
sequel
quite
well
.
during
a
film-class
discussion
,
windsor
college
student
articulate
what
these
inevitable
law
be
,
and
why
sequel
never
live
up
to
the
original
.
a
few
rare
exception
be
note
,
but
they
leave
out
one
.
.
.
scream
2
!
1996
's
surprise
horror
blockbuster
scream
become
a
instant
hit
and
develop
a
obsessive
coterie
of
fan
which
include
almost
every
teenager
in
america
!
a
sequel
be
unavoidable
,
but
luckily
the
re-teaming
of
writer
kevin
williamson
and
director
we
craven
give
we
nothing
to
fear
in
the
way
of
lose
entertainment
.
in
fact
,
at
the
risk
of
sound
sacrilegious
to
all
the
adorning
fan
of
scream
,
i
would
say
that
scream
2
might
even
be
the
better
film
!

the
sinuous
heroine
who
survive
a
series
of
murder
in
woodsboro
,
can
in
the
original
scream
,
be
now
two
year
older
and
off
to
college
,
major
in
theater
.
meanwhile
,
tv
journalist
gale
weather
-lrb-
courtney
cox
-rrb-
,
who
cover
the
murder
in
the
first
film
,
have
since
write
a
book
about
the
dreadful
event
;
a
book
title
''
stab
''
,
which
have
be
develop
into
a
major
motion
picture
.
as
scream
2
open
,
a
crowd
of
overzealous
teenager
be
pile
into
a
crowded
movie
theater
for
the
premiere
of
''
stab
''
,
and
before
long
,
a
young
couple
be
butcher
to
death
,
unnoticed
in
the
midst
of
hysteria
.
this
mark
the
beginning
of
a
new
murder
spree
as
a
unknown
''
copycat
''
set
out
to
repeat
what
be
be
do
.
.
.
and
finish
what
have
not
!
of
course
the
killer
be
just
as
obsess
with
movie
as
the
killer
in
the
first
film
,
and
yes
,
movie
play
a
huge
role
in
the
bizarre
psychological
outlook
the
murderer
hold
as
he\/she
go
about
slaying
a
assortment
of
gorgeous
twenty
year
old
,
but
this
\*
be
\*
a
sequel
,
and
without
deviate
from
the
original
groundwork
we
be
still
give
a
fresh
outlook
on
horror
movie
.
this
be
in
large
part
due
to
williamson
's
deliciously
write
script
,
which
will
easily
leave
you
satisfied
.
as
much
as
the
film
condemn
the
use
of
cliche
,
it
be
riddled
with
they
,
but
it
be
do
so
effectively
,
and
with
skillful
direction
by
craven
,
that
you
be
not
bind
to
complain
.
i
will
note
,
however
,
that
the
''
whodunit
?
''
do
wind
up
be
the
first
person
i
suspect
,
but
believe
I
,
i
keep
change
my
mind
as
i
try
to
stay
one
ahead
of
the
movie
.
all
the
actor
outdo
themselves
here
.
we
be
not
talk
oscar
performance
,
but
cambell
,
cox
,
david
arquette
as
dewey
riley
,
and
jamie
kennedy
as
randy
all
give
surprisingly
satisfy
performance
that
go
beyond
they
last
outing
.
the
character
remain
true
to
they
root
,
and
yet
show
a
clear
sign
of
development
over
the
last
two
year
.
we
can
see
how
the
event
in
the
first
film
have
affect
they
,
but
we
do
not
lose
any
of
the
luster
that
make
they
such
a
delight
to
watch
in
the
first
place
.
the
nice
thing
about
scream
2
be
that
it
do
not
seem
off-kilter
from
it
be
predecessor
.
it
be
a
natural
,
smooth
,
and
believable
-lrb-
as
far
as
horror
film
go
-rrb-
transition
from
film
to
film
.
we
skip
two
year
,
but
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
hole
or
shortcut
take
in
connect
the
two
flick
.
it
flow
so
well
that
you
feel
more
like
you
be
read
chapter
two
of
a
book
-lrb-
long
chapter
,
eh
?
-rrb-
than
just
revitalize
a
cast
of
familiar
face
.
while
main
character
be
usually
the
only
connection
in
sequel
,
scream
2
's
entire
plot
structure
correlate
\*
completely
\*
with
the
first
,
make
for
immediate
fondness
and
absorption
.
as
i
say
before
,
scream
2
easily
live
up
to
,
if
not
surpass
,
it
be
precursor
.
the
only
reason
scream
will
likely
be
hail
above
scream
2
be
because
it
be
the
first
.
this
do
not
mean
that
it
overcast
the
unique
,
whimsical
humor
or
overall
caliber
of
it
be
sequel
,
it
just
mean
that
scream
will
forever
be
know
as
the
movie
that
mock
it
be
own
while
maintain
it
be
sought-after
quality
.
if
ever
a
film
follow
it
be
original
so
well
,
it
would
be
scream
2
,
and
it
make
this
a
definite
must-see
for
all
those
unbridled
scream
fan
out
there
.
scream
2
fit
snugly
alongside
scream
,
and
will
hopefully
receive
as
many
high
remark
.
it
would
top
off
the
series
quite
well
,
if
it
be
not
for
the
fact
that
two
movie
do
not
really
make
a
series
.
it
be
unlikely
to
assume
that
a
scream
3
will
not
appear
in
the
next
few
year
,
but
if
they
do
decide
to
turn
this
into
a
undeniably
acclaimed
horror-trilogy
,
let
's
hope
they
can
keep
up
the
fantastic
work
.
like
they
say
,
do
not
mess
with
perfection
.
.
.
but
when
a
money-making
smash-hit
be
almost
guarantee
,
who
be
gonna
listen
?
