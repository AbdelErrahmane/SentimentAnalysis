after
the
other
,

by
year
and
year
of
history
.
perhaps
one
of
the
best
thing
about
this
film
,
be
its
naturalness
.
no
situation
be
over-wrought
,
and
character
react
as
real
people
do
,
to
real
problem
.
this
probably
be
a
result
of
the
film
be
from
a
stage
play
.
the
play
be
in
turn
be
base
on
a
time
in
the
life
of
the
playwright
.
what
seem
to
be
a
underlying
theme
be
the
pagan
ritual
and
dance
of
people
,
both
in
lughnasa
and
africa
.
in
fact
,
dance
seem
to
be
the
glue
that
hold
the
family
together
and
most
expressively

closeness

and

sway
even
in
the
midst
of
impending
disaster
.
only
after
the
music
stop
,
and
the
character
stand
breathe
heavily
do
we
sense
any
trouble
.
in
the
quiet
after
the
music
we
muse
that
it
be
sad
that
music
have
to
cease
,
and
family
falter
.
the
movie
be
frame
by
a
scene
of
michael
mundy
,
the
narrator
of
the
movie
,
as
a
young
child
fly
a
kite
.
he
trip
over
a
bump
and
lose
hold
of
he
string
,
and
the
kite
float
off
farther
into
the
distance
.
draw
on
the
white
diamond
of
the
kite
be
a
face
that
look
at
once
pained
,
and
at
another
glance
mischievous
.
the
mundy
family
itself
follow
a
similar
fate
to
that
of
the
kite
,
and
kate
's
hold
of
the
family
be
not
strong
enough
to
hold
off
the
wind
of
change
.
as
michael
stand
,
stare
at
he
kite
fly
away
,
we
hear
the
adult
michael
,
look
back
at
the
season
that
he
world
change
forever
.
the
movie
be
not
overpowering
,
but
it
give
we
a
beautiful
window
into
the
life
,
love
,
and
trouble
of
a
household
of
lonely
woman
.
note
:
this
be
the
first
movie
review
i
have
ever
write
,
any
response
on
it
would
be
greatly
appreciate
.
