there
be
a
moment
late
in
robert
zemecki
's
contact
where
i
be
remind
of
why
i
start
write
movie
review
in
the
first
place
.
we
see
a
scientist
,
dress
in
a
silvery
space
suit
,
walk
tentatively
across
a
narrow
walkway
lead
inside
a
compact
,
spherical
space
pod
,
unaware
of
what
await
when
the
ball
literally
drop
.
anticipation
,
excitement
,
anxiety
,
fear
--
the
audience
experience
it
all
the
emotional
tension
right
with
the
character
,
nervously
,
breathlessly
eager
to
see
what
lie
ahead
.
it
be
this
sense
of
discovery
,
the
anticipation
of
which
and
its
accompany
exhilaration
,
that
make
this
adaptation
of
the
carl
sagan
novel
such
magical
,
captivating
entertainment
.
jodie
foster
star
as
dr
.
ellie
arroway
,
a
brilliant
astronomer
who
dedicate
she
entire
life
to
search
outer
space
for
extraterrestrial
radio
signal
.
and
i
mean
life
--
after
lose
she
entire
family
when
she
be
young
,
the
only
thing
occupy
ellie
's
world
be
this
quest
to
discover
life
beyond
this
earth
.
after
deal
with
much
skepticism
on
the
part
of
government
official
and
wealthy
financier
,
ellie
receive
she
vindication
when
she
stumble
upon
a
incoming
radio
transmission
from
the
distant
star
vega
,
which
include
instruction
on
build
a
interstellar
transport
.
from
this
synopsis
,
contact
do
not
sound
too
different
to
most
film
about
alien
contact
,
but
there
be
a
whole
lot
more
to
this
intelligent
film
than
the
sci-fi
hook
.
the
alien
contact
angle
generate
a
great
amount
of
suspense
and
awe
,
but
perhaps
more
than
anything
else
,
contact
be
a
character
study
of
ellie
,
whose
obsession
with
empirical
,
scientific
evidence
have
erase
all
belief
in
a
higher
power
.
the
irony
be
that
,
while
admit
to
have
no
religious
faith
,
she
hold
onto
she
belief
in
extraterrestrial
life
with
such
passion
and
conviction
that
it
become
,
in
a
sense
,
a
religion
in
its
own
right
.
it
would
be
easy
for
scripter
jame
v
.
hart
and
michael
goldenberg
,
in
try
to
paint
a
positive
image
of
the
heroine
,
to
champion
she
scientific
belief
over
religious
one
,
but
they
wisely
eschew
easy
answer
,
give
equal
time
to
both
side
,
and
in
so
do
depict
ellie
as
not
completely
sane
.
in
the
end
,
there
be
no
right
or
wrong
,
nor
be
there
one
side
that
come
off
more
positive
in
the
other
,
even
slightly
so
--
there
be
just
two
very
viable
point
of
view
,
each
with
they
own
merit
,
each
with
they
own
fault
.
the
complex
role
of
ellie
be
a
actress
's
dream
,
and
foster
,
a
virtual
shoo-in
for
yet
another
best
actress
oscar
nomination
next
year
,
more
than
rise
to
the
challenge
.
she
convey
intelligence
,
determination
,
warmth
,
and
,
in
a
gutsy
move
,
always
on
edge
.
we
root
for
ellie
and
feel
for
she
,
but
we
also
feel
at
time
that
she
go
too
far
.
contact
be
clearly
foster
's
vehicle
,
but
other
be
give
they
chance
to
shine
in
smaller
role
.
matthew
mcconaughey
,
who
receive
outrageously
high
billing
for
he
smallish
role
,
hold
he
own
as
the
religious
counterpoint
to
ellie
,
spiritual
scholar
and
government
adviser
palmer
joss
-lrb-
however
,
he
main
storyline
,
the
tentative
palmer-ellie
romance
,
be
the
film
's
weakest
subplot
-rrb-
.
john
hurt
be
effectively
creepy
as
s
.
r
.
hadden
,
the
wealthy
eccentric
who
provide
ellie
with
she
research
funding
.
angelum
bassett
continue
to
impress
in
she
bit
role
as
white
house
aide
rachel
constantine
.
most
memorable
of
all
,
though
,
be
tom
skerritt
and
jame
wood
,
who
play
rival
scientist
dr
.
david
drumlin
and
national
security
adviser
michael
litz
,
respectively
;
both
,
especially
skerritt
,
embody
these
asshole
character
that
the
audience
hiss
just
about
every
single
one
of
they
appearance
.
zemecki
come
off
of
he
three-year
break
in
top
shape
.
always
know
as
a
director
of
effects-laden
extravaganza
,
it
come
as
no
surprise
that
contact
's
visual
effect
be
quite
stunning
.
the
central
space
journey
be
more
than
a
little
reminiscent
of
the
close
of
2001
:
a
space
odyssey
,
but
with
more
advanced
technology
at
he
disposal
,
zemecki
's
voyage
be
even
trippier
than
stanley
kubrick
's
yet
more
wondrously
pure
.
and
zemecki
do
not
resist
the
urge
to
use
the
always-interesting
incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage
effect
,
which
be
every
bit
as
seamless
here
as
it
be
in
forrest
gump
.
effect
,
however
,
be
confine
to
only
a
few
scene
and
clearly
take
a
back
seat
to
the
drama
,
emotion
,
and
pure
wonder
,
which
zemecki
prove
to
be
quite
adept
at
in
gump
.
it
say
a
lot
that
,
in
a
summer
science
fiction
film
such
as
this
,
it
be
not
so
much
the
effect
that
stay
with
you
as
it
be
the
drama
and
the
issue
that
be
raise
.
the
thought-provoking
,
two-hour-plus
contact
be
a
much-welcome
change
of
pace
from
summer
no-brainer
,
but
the
fact
that
it
be
a
smart
film
do
not
mean
that
it
also
be
not
entertaining
.
for
all
the
interesting
question
it
ask
,
the
film
be
still
what
it
be
be
sell
as
--
''
a
journey
to
the
heart
of
the
universe
.
''
and
what
a
fascinating
,
unforgettable
journey
it
be
.
