of
a
bad
rap
for

destine
for
underrated
heaven
.
that
be
what
it
be
:
a
underrated
gem
of
a
movie
.
and
what
a
shame
because
pacino
and
de
palma
both
do
amazing
job
with
it
,
and
turn
it
into
a
great
piece
of
a
pulpy
character

''
carlito

deal
with
,
well
,
carlito
brigante
-lrb-
pacino
-rrb-
,
a
puerto
rican
ex-drug
kingpin
,
who
get

jailterm
when
he
coke-addicted
,
curly-haired
lawyer

legal
technicality
.
of
course
,
carlito
be
actually
awake
in
prison
,
and
have
decide
to
go
straight
,
even
if
he
be
really
a
crook
at
heart
.
carlito
,
like
barry
lyndon
,
be
a
man
who
be
trap
by
fate
at
every
turn
,
and
can
not
escape
into
something
he
be
not
.
carlito
's
attempt
at
a
clean
,
legal
life
be
thwart
at
nearly
every
turn
.
when
he
first
get
out
,
a
friend
of
he
end
up
lead
he
into
a
big
shoot-out
,
where
he
have

bug
by
the
government
to
see
if

anything
illegal
,
and
he
lawyer
find
himself
neck-deep
in
a
pile
of
shit
,
need
he
to
try
and
help
he
out
,
which
include
he
do
some
prison
breaking
.
carlito
,
like
ratso
rizzo
,
want
to
go
to
miamus
-lrb-
since
,
accord
to
film
logic
,
that
be
where
it
be
at
-rrb-
,
but
need
some
funding
.
be
a
legend
,
he
be
quickly
able
to
get
a
nice
job
run
a
big
dance
club
-lrb-
this
be
the
70s
,
by
the
way
,
and
since
some
of
this
take
place
in
night
club
,
we
get
to
hear
all
sort
of
70s
classic
,
include
several
k
.
c
.
and
the
sunshine
band
tune
-
my
personal
favorite
-rrb-
.
he
get
a
bodyguard
-lrb-
the
great
lui
guzman
,
at
he
best
-rrb-
,
and
be
soon
run
a
pretty
good
business
,
even
if
he
be
constantly
attract
underworld
young
thug
,
like
benny
blanco
''
from
the
bronx
''
-lrb-
john
leguiziamo
-rrb-
,
who
be
more
than
once
point
out
to
be
a
young
version
of
carlito
.
on
the
other
side
,
the
symbol
of
promise
and
hope
,
be
gail
-lrb-
penelope
ann
miller
-
what
happen
to
she
?
-rrb-
,
he
girlfriend
from
before
prison
.
she
be
a
goregeous
ballerina
,
and
a
stripper
,
and
soon
carlito
be
try
to
get
back
with
she
,
and
take
she
with
he
when
he
finally
leave
for
miamus
.
while
this
relationship
be
never
fully
define
or
anything
,
we
get
a
sense
of
love
between
they
,
and
they
have
some
truly
interesting
scene
between
they
-lrb-
she
never
give
he
address
or
locale
-
he
always
have
to
track
she
down
-rrb-
.
all
of
these
element
clash
together
at
the
end
,
in
a
brilliantly
execute
,
emotional
climax
,
which
be
inevitable
.
when
i
say
inevitable
,
i
mean
we
see
it
at
the
beginning
and
then
backtrack
,
put
a
great
spin
on
it
.
sure
,
it
be
go
to
eleveate
some
of
the
tension
,
but
it
give
the
film
a
lot
of
depth
,
as
carlito
be
see
trap
by
fate
.
what
be
amazing
be
the
big
chase
sequence
-lrb-
amazingly
do
by
de
palma
-rrb-
have
a
lot
of
tension
and
thrill
.
like
''
apollo
13
,
''
we
know
what
be
go
to
happen
,
but
we
be
still
thrill
by
what
happen
in
the
middle
.
it
be
also
very
emotional
,
thanks
to
a
great
script
by
david
koepp
,
and
amazing
performance
by
pacino
and
miller
.
de
palma
be
famous
-lrb-
or
infamous
-rrb-
for
lot
of
violence
in
he
film
.
he
earlier
flim
,
''
scarface
''
-lrb-
which
star
pacino
in
the
lead
-rrb-
,
have
a
ton
of
it
,
especially
at
the
end
-lrb-
and
a
nasty
chainsaw
scene
towards
the
beginning
which
i
be
still
not
over
-rrb-
.
but
de
palma
actually
reign
in
more
quieter
scene
.
to
I
,
the
best
scene
in
the
film
be
when
carlito
be
on
top
of
a
building
,
look
down
into
the
room
where
gail
be
do
ballet
.
this
be
the
most
brilliantly
do
,
and
most
emotionally
stimulate
scene
in
the
entire
film
,
and
probably
the
best
in
de
palma
film
history
.
with
a
gorgeous
soprano
duet
in
the
background
,
and
rain
pour
down
onto
a
trashcan
lid
cover
carlito
's
head
,
and
a
saddened
,
remorseful
look
on
pacino
's
face
,
it
be
a
tear-jerker
-lrb-
well
,
for
I
,
i
dunno
about
you
...
-rrb-
.
the
act
from
all
be
great
,
especially
from
the
three
lead
.
pacino
be
pan
for
he
performance
,
chiefly
because
he
accent
be
not
puerto
rican
enough
and
,
well
,
it
be
not
as
''
strong
''
as
he
oscar-winning
role
in
''
scent
of
a
woman
.
''
well
,
he
''
scent
of
a
woman
''
performance
be
great
and
all
,
but
it
be
nothing
really
but
,
as
comic
kevin
pollack
say
,
a
''
foghorn
leghorn
impression
.
''
in
''
carlito
's
way
,
''
he
be
emotional
,
and
strong
,
despite
the
fact
that
he
be
remorseful
over
he
entire
lifestyle
,
which
he
can
not
change
.
i
feel
more
for
carlito
brigante
than
i
do
for
the
tango-dancing
,
insult-throwing
blind
guy
in
''
scent
of
a
woman
.
''
as
i
say
,
penelope
ann
miller
be
great
,
and
she
and
pacino
actually
have
very
good
chemistry
.
and
they
be
scene
be
well-written
,
with
some
good
clever
dialogue
which
add
some
interest
to
a
otherwise
bland
relationship
.
and
sean
penn
be
amazing
as
the
coke-addicted
rat
attorney
.
every
scene
he
be
in
,
he
have
great
energy
,
and
even
measure
up
to
the
greatness
that
be
pacino
.
in
smaller
role
,
john
leguiziamo
and
lui
guzman
be
great
.
''
carlito
's
way
''
be
one
of
those
film
which
you
hear
about
briefly
,
but
when
you
finally
watch
it
,
you
be
absolutely
blow
away
.
it
be
a
wonderful
film
,
a
highly
underrated
little
masterpiece
which
be
shelve
after
it
do
not
do
so
hot
.
but
trust
I
and
check
it
out
.
it
be
a
great
little
film
,
and
proof
that
the
residential
critic
and
mass
populus
be
not
always
right
.
