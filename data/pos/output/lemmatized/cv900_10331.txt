thus
be
start
a
tale
of
romance
and
intrigue
,
and
a
tale
of
death
and
tragedy
...
this
movie
be
about
a
tragic
event
that
take
place
a
great
many
year
ago
,
a
even
that
should
not
be
take
lightly
as
any
other
bit
of
historical
trivia
.
the
movie
titanic
show
what
happen
,
maybe
not
with
a
100
%
degree
of
accuracy
,
but
it
still
show
it
very
realisticaly
.
now
the
titanic
be
both
a
story
on
its
own
and
a
backdrop
for
a
story
.
it
serve
as
both
admirably
,
brine
forth
a
interesting
story
that
although
simple
in
its
most
simple
premise
be
very
captivating
.
this
movie
be
very
emotional
simply
because
of
what
it
be
,
but
that
alone
be
not
enough
.
the
story
be
bring
out
with
a
certain
style
that
make
be
so
much
more
emotional
and
so
much
more
effective
.
movie
such
as
this
will
not
be
forget
all
too
quickly
and
unfortunately
then
be
not
something
that
be
produce
by
hollywood
with
any
great
frequency
.
the
attention
to
detail
that
be
pay
be
remarkable
.
the
whole
premise
for
the
tell
of
the
story
be
interesting
,
with
the
showing
of
brand
new
footage
from
the
wreck
of
the
titanic
add
much
flavor
to
a
already
good
movie
.
part
of
the
magical
chemistry
behind
this
story
be
the
act
,
and
for
this
movie
its
extremely
good
act
from
the
whole
cast
.
the
performance
put
in
by
the
main
star
be
something
to
be
admire
.
the
character
be
play
out
so
memorably
that
both
leonardo
dicaprip
and
kate
winslet
should
receive
at
the
least
nomination
for
they
role
.
look
at
the
act
do
in
the
movie
it
seem
as
if
they
be
not
act
but
be
actually
the
character
in
the
movie
.
the
casting
for
the
movie
could
really
have
be
better
,
in
my
humble
opinion
that
be
.
one
character
that
will
most
likely
not
be
mention
by
any
other
review
or
commentary
about
this
film
be
that
of
the
ship
itself
.
yes
,
you
read
correctly
,
the
ship
be
a
character
.
how
be
the
titanic
a
character
?
you
ask
well
simple
,
a
ship
have
a
certain
character
about
it
and
as
most
sailor
and
boat
man
will
tell
you
.
this
character
be
everything
about
the
ship
from
its
specification
to
its
luxury
and
the
titanic
be
no
stranger
to
this
.
mr
.
cameron
bring
the
ship
to
life
in
a
almost
literal
sense
.
all
this
add
to
the
movie
in
a
certain
way
that
most
hollywood
production
cant
seem
to
grasp
.
now
,
to
produce
the
effect
that
i
mention
above
and
to
sink
the
ship
itself
be
feat
that
be
accomplish
by
special
effect
wizard
.
the
effect
in
this
movie
range
from
marvelous
costume
to
beautifully
render
scene
of
the
ship
sink
.
in
some
respects
you
can
not
tell
that
the
effect
be
there
,
you
simply
think
that
what
you
see
be
what
happen
or
what
be
happen
-lrb-
if
you
imagination
be
good
-rrb-
.
the
technical
wizardry
do
in
this
movie
be
just
spectacular
and
actually
get
new
footage
from
the
wreck
of
the
titanic
be
unique
.
the
movie
will
leave
you
amaze
at
the
effect
,
and
that
be
a
feat
since
there
be
no
monster
or
alien
in
this
movie
,
just
human
and
a
oversized
ship
.
the
movie
will
amaze
you
and
it
will
pull
on
you
emotion
,
the
theater
that
i
go
to
have
a
few
people
leave
with
tear
in
they
eye
.
now
that
be
not
a
feat
accomplish
by
most
movie
,
now
the
fact
that
the
tragedy
actually
occur
be
bring
home
with
something
of
a
punch
,
i
wont
spoil
the
end
and
say
what
happen
regardless
it
be
a
interesting
movie
from
begin
to
the
very
end
.
the
historical
value
of
this
movie
be
quite
high
,
and
honestly
be
something
that
should
be
watch
for
the
sake
of
see
it
and
see
the
tragedy
,
for
it
be
extremely
well
do
.
the
method
of
tell
the
story
be
also
good
,
maybe
not
totally
unique
but
effective
none
the
less
.
regardless
of
anything
mention
above
this
movie
be
a
grandiose
production
and
the
sheer
size
of
the
project
undertake
be
something
to
be
marvel
at
.
the
simple
fact
that
the
movie
be
smashingly
successful
at
what
it
aim
to
achieve
be
just
astonishing
.

it
might
not
be
the
best
movie
in
the

fairly
highly
and
be
