anyone
who
see
alan
rickman
's
finely-realized
performance
in
truly
madly
deeply
and
sense
and
sensibility
will
be
unsurprised
that
the
actor-turned-director
be
a
bit
of
a
poet
at
heart
.
however
,
for
those
who
recall
he
only
as
the
maniacal
villain
of
die
hard
and
robin
hood
:
prince
of
thief
,
this
recognition
may
be
something
of
a
shock
.
nevertheless
,
''
poetic
''
be
a
excellent
term
to
describe
rickman
's
feature
debut
as
a
director
,
the
winter
guest
.
the
film
have
a
simple
,
unhurried
rhythm
that
use
all
of
the
available
element
to
fashion
a
successful
whole
.
the
result
be
a
occasionally
haunting
,
sometimes
magical
,
and
always
insightful
human
drama
.
the
winter
guest
be
not
about
resolve
plot
thread
and
advance
a
story
line
;
it
be
about
explore
relationship
and
examine
life
in
all
of
its
stage
.
the
winter
guest
do
not
tell
a
traditional
tale
,
nor
do
it
ascribe
to
a
conventional
narrative
structure
?
there
be
no
real
beginning
or
end
.
instead
,
we
be
give
a
opportunity
to
observe
one
day
in
the
life
of
eight
human
.
they
represent
both
sex
,
multiple
generation
,
and
a
variety
of
relationship
?
male
and
female
;
young
,
middle-aged
,
and
elderly
;
friend
,
would-be
lover
,
and
kin
.
we
see
expectation
fulfil
and
disappoint
,
emotional
boundary
erode
,
and
truth
unveil
.
there
be
comedy
and
tragedy
.
most
importantly
,
much
of
what
transpire
during
the
course
of
the
winter
guest
will
find
a
echo
in
we
own
life
?
in
this
fiction
can
be
find
much
truth
.
the
setting
be
small
town
in
scotland
on
the
coldest
day
of
the
year
.
it
be
so
frigid
that
the
sea
have
begin
to
freeze
over
.
the
onshore
wind
cut
like
a
knife
and
snow
blanket
the
beach
,
give
the
terrain
a
alien
appearance
.
it
be
against
this
backdrop
that
the
relationship
of
the
film
be
capture
.
there
be
four
pairing
,
and
,
although
there
be
some
interaction
between
the
different
twosome
,
the
winter

have
a
stormy
relationship
.
they
love
each
other
deeply
,
but
both
be
stubborn
and
willful
,
and
neither
be
willing
to
admit
that
they
need
the
other
.
much
of
they
interaction
be
argumentative
,
but
,
during
the
course
of
a
long
walk
to
the
frozen
shoreline
,
they
come
to
a
unspoken
understanding
of
how
much
each
mean
to
the
other
.

death
be
a
topic
of
endless
fascination
for
they
,
perhaps
because
they
be
so
close
to
it
,
and
they
spend
they
spare
time
scan
the
obituary
,
look
for
the
next

unlike
lily
and
chloe
,
these
two
have
they
entire
life
ahead
of
they
.
they
be
young
enough
to
still
believe
in
magic
,
but
old
enough
to
recognize
that
the
process
of
cross
into
adulthood
rob
life
of
the
simple
joy
that
only
child
can
experience
.
the
acting
be
strong
and
believable
.
the
mixture
of
veteran
performer
and
first-timer
be
effective
,
with
the
most
successful
choice
be
the
casting
of
real-life
mother
and
daughter
phylida

and
emma
thompson
in
the
most
prominent
role

there
be
a
chemistry
in

interaction
that
would
be
hard
to
replicate
with
two
different
,
non-related
actor

and
,
of
course
,
the
physical
resemblance
make
it
that
much
easier
to
accept
elspeth
and

as
parent
and
child

the
rough
,
bleak
scottish
countryside
become
as
much
of
a
character
as
any
of
the

in

,
consider
how
important
the
climate
be
to
every
relationship
under
