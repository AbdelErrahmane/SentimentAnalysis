polley

refuse
to
do

for
this
picture
on
the
basis
that
she
be
''
not

she
turn
as
the
ill-fated
cashier
.
in
go
,
she
deliver
,
hands-down
,
she
best
performance
to
date
.
here
be
a
-lrb-
overrated
-rrb-
actress
who
agree
to
appear
on
the
poster
,
but
not
support
she
team
at
the
junket
or
in
interview
;
this
sort
of
arrogance
be
commonplace
for
m
.
polley
,
as
anyone
who
have
read
of
she
political
agenda
in
the
canadian
press
will
tell
you
.
if
she
do
not
want
to
be
the
ingenue
of
the
moment
,
she
should
have
say
''
no
,
''
not
go
.
but
i
digress
.
go
be
a
fun
film
,
so
chipperly
depraved
one
can
not
help
but
turn
off
he
moral
judgment
for
its
duration
and
enjoy
the
ride
.
in
that
sense
,
it
be
a
departure
from
liman
's
last
film
,
swinger
,
which
at
least
lecture
against
self-absorption
in
the
form
of
vince
vaughan
's
trent
and
he
subtle
comeuppance
in
the
story
's
clever
epilogue
-lrb-
which
have
be
ape
by
mcdonald

for
they
latest
commercial

i
wish
i
care
more
about
go
's
character
:
like
the
techno
music
they
listen
to
,
the
band
of
anarchist
on
display
here
be
at
once
absorb
and
vacuous
.
when
the
light
come
up
and
sting
my
eye
,
it
be
difficult
to
recall
what
about
it
entertain
I
.
yet
entertain
I
it
do
.
go
be
light
and
frothy
,
feature
compelling
if
not
endearing
work
by
polley
,
timothy
olyphant
-lrb-
scream
2
-rrb-
,
and
especially
fichtner
,
whose
homoerotic
behavior
be
milk
for
effective
laugh
.
fichtner
be
a
character
actor
best
know
for
play
backstabber
-lrb-
in
heat
,
armageddon
,
and
other
-rrb-
;
he
previously
untapped
comic
ability
shine
in
go
.
unlike
much
of
the
film
,
fichtner
be
unpredictable
.
