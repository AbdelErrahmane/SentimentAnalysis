the
question
be
not
why
have
grease
be
reissue
.
the
answer
to
that
one
be
easy
:
to
celebrate
the
movie
's
20th
anniversary
and
to
make
more
buck
for
paramount
's
coffer
because
john
travolta
be
once
again
a
hot
commodity
.
no
,
the
question
that
ought
to
be
ask
be
:
should
grease
be
reissue
?
the
answer
be
not
a
easy
one
.
grease
be
a
fun
movie
,
a
entertaining
fantasy
of
the
'50s
,
embody
all
the
cliche
of
that
era
.
the
music
be
lively
and
the
dance
number
,
choreograph
by
patricium
birch
,
be
energetic
and
high-spirited
.
travolta
be
at
he
pinnacle
as
a
sexual
icon
,
cool
,
but
non-threatening
.
but
grease
do
not
break
any
new
cinematic
ground
.
it
be
not
a
milestone
in
movie
history
such
as
citizen
kane
or
easy
rider
.
what
grease
be
-
or
have
become
-
be
the
highest-grossing
musical
in
film
history
.
ok
,
let
's
not
be
a
spoilsport
.
grease
be
a
fun
and
entertaining
movie
,
even
though
it
stretch
credulity
to
see
such
performer
as
travolta
,
olivium
newton-john
,
taxi
's
jeff
conaway
and
the
multi-talented
stockard
channing
try
to
act
like
high
schooler
.
it
be
nostalgic
to
recall
how
good
a
dancer
travolta
be
,
and
it
be
sad
to
think
of
what
could
have
be
have
not
a
few
misstep
sidetrack
he
career
.
he
could
have
become
a
musical
comedy
star
in
the
tradition
of
gene
kelly
.
cinematically
,
the
musical
comedy
have
basically
go
the
way
of
the
dinosaur
.
between
grease
and
1996
's
evita
.
,
you
can
probably
count
the
number
of
movie
musical
on
one
hand
.
two
reason
have
contribute
to
the
demise
of
the
genre
:
the
first
be
that
movie
audience
have
become
more
sophisticated
,
no
,
make
that
cynical
and
jaded
.
today
,
if
a
character
begin
to
dance
and
sing
with
no
orchestra
in
sight
,
he
or
she
would
probably
be
hoot
off
the
screen
.
today
's
audience
lack
the
innocence
,
that
belief
in
movie
magic
that
be
require
for
a
musical
to
succeed
.
secondly
,
a
lack
of
talent
.
performer
with
the
charisma
,
the
style
,
the
larger-than-life
panache
of
fred
astaire
,
gene
kelly
,
ginger
roger
and
judy
garland
be
go
.
most
singer
and
dancer
remain
on
the
stage
,
and
those
who
do
succeed
in
movie
usually
wind
up
in
serious
dramatic
part
.
a
good
example
be
gregory
hine
,
one
of
the
greatest
dancer
in
the
world
.
he
dance
a
bit
in
the
cotton
club
,
tap
and
white
night
,
but
those
be
essentially
dramatic
vehicle
.
so
,
perhaps
the
reissue
of
grease
can
serve
a
purpose
.
if
audience
show
enough
interest
,
mean
if
the
re-release
earn
the
studio
enough
revenue
,
it
may
spark
a
revival
in
movie
musical
.
perhaps
not
original
musical
such
as
singin
'
in
the
rain
,
a
american
in
pari
or
seven
bride
for
seven
brother
,
but
for
broadway
property
that
have
be
in
the
planning
stage
for
film
adaptation
for
several
year
.
at
one
time
or
another
,
accord
to
the
industry
rumor
mill
,
hollywood
have
be
set
to
create
a
animated
version
of
andrew
lloyd
webber
's
cat
,
a
film
of
the
popular
phantom
of
the
opera
as
well
as
les
miserables
and
chicago
,
the
latter
reportedly
to
star
madonna
.
so
,
let
this
grease
be
the
forerunner
of
a
armada
of
movie
musical
.
let
grease
be
the
word
that
spark
this
revival
.
