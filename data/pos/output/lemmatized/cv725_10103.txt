special
something
''
to

be
inspire
and
the
touch
of
black

a
certain
bite
.
meg
ryan
,
know
from
''
when
harry
meet
sally
''
or
''
sleepless
in
seattle
''
,
surprise
in
a
role
that
may
finally
help
she
get
rid
of
she
sweet
little
girl
image
.
she
impress
the
viewer
as
a
maneat
biker
girl
.
even
more
surprising
be
the
fact
that
the
viewer
believe
she
,
much
more
so
than
in
last
year
''
courage
under
fire
''
where
she
play
a
gulf
war
pilot
.
matthew
broderick
be
the
goodnatured
and
somewhat
naive
sam
who
have
trouble
accept
reality
.
the
viewer
can
tell
that
he
do
not
only
watch
the
star
but
also
try
to
reach
out
for
they
.
he
have
trouble
keep
in
touch
with
reality
.
after
all
,
who
would
leave
everything
behind
to
chase
a
lose
love
?
he
naivet
?
that
we
do
not
question
for
a
minute
throughout
the
movie
clash
with
maggy
exaggerate
wish
for
revenge
.
she
would
do
anything
to
harm
anton
.
she
do
not
hesitate
to
use
sam
for
she
plan
and
make
he
understand
right
from
the
beginning
that
nothing
will
happen
between
the
two
of
they
.
that
make
the
scene
when
they
innocently
share
a
bed
,
have
potatoe
chip
and
watch
the
action
across
the
street
like
a
Saturday
night
show
on
tv
even
funnier
.
tch
?
ky
karyo
be
perfect
as
anton
.
he
be
,
well
,
repulsive
.
that
be
all
there
be
to
say
about
he
.
you
can
not
really
manage
to
pity
he
,
even
after
all
he
mishap
.
he
not
only
take
sam
's
bride
away
from
he
,
he
be
also
a
french
chef
.
world
collide
,
i
.
e
.
the
usa
and
france
.
this
can
only
go
wrong
.
even
if
maggy
revenge
scheme
be
at
time
shocking
,
you
just
can
not
sympathize
with
a
man
who
play
''
je
t
`
aime
...
moi
non
plus
''
on
he
tape
deck
.
not
everyone
be
capture
by
the
french
charme
that
linda
and
even
maggie
fall
for
.
sam
certainly
be
not
.
too
bad
for
anton
.
for
he
thing
take
a
turn
to
the
worse
.
''
addict
to
love
''
be
one
of
this
year
