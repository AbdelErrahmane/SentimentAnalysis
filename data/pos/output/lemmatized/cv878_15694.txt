exactly
a

julie

still
unable

reluctantly
return

find
that
all

almost
immediately
,
julie
recieve
a
ominous
letter

simply
read
,
''

that
be
the
start
of

problem

.
''
i
know
what
you
do
last
summer
,
''
be
a
successful
horror
film
for
a
number
of
reason
.
the
cinematography
by
deni
crossan
could
very
well
be
describe
as
hitchcockian
,
as
it
put
shadow
,
fog
,
steam
,
and
other
clever
device
to
add
atmosphere
to
the
proceedings
.
the
character
,
particularly
julie
and
helen
,
be
realistically
write
,
and
the
film
amazingly
deal
with
they
broken
relationship
in
a
few
scene
,
which
be
largely
uncharacteristic
in
film
of
this
sort
.
and
last
,
the
film
create
a
few
dazzling
and
scary
set-piece
that
be
some
of
the
most
memorable
i
have
see
in
a
horror
movie
,
particularly
the
suspenseful
,
superbly
shoot
sequence
involve
helen
at
she
family
's
store
with
the
killer
inside
with
she
.
perhaps
the
best
character
be
that
of
missy
egan
-lrb-
anne
heche
-rrb-
,
a
lonely
backwoods
woman
whose
brother
be
the
one
julie
think
they
hit
.
heche
's
performance
be
a
standout
,
as
she
be
able
to
create
a
full
character
in
only
about
ten
minute
of
screen
time
.
''
i
know

problem

.
give
a
performance
to
be
desire
here
,
and
much
of
he
dialogue
sound
wooden
come
out
of

.
also
,
the
climax
of
the
film
almost
completely
lose
its
frightening
grip
after
it
unveil
the
mystery
killer
,
who
be
a
decidedly
bad
actor
and
should
not
have
be
give
any
line
.
luckily
,
the
penultimate
scene
save
the
disappointing
finale
,
which
include
a
expertly
craft
''
jump-in-your-seat
''
scare
.
in
the
main
role
,
hewitt
and
gellar
be
highly
talented
,
and
hewitt
,
especially
,
be
one
of
the
best
screamer
i
have
ever
hear
.
she
honestly
could
give
jamie
lee
curti
a
little
competition
for
the
best
''
scream
queen
.
''
and
gellar
be
touch
as
a
young
woman
who
,
in
the
course
of
one
year
,
find
she
dream
of
be
a
actress
ultimately
shatter
.
although
not
up
to
the
level
of
either
''

movie
,
or
the
more
recent
,
''
urban
legend
,
''
''

a
respectable

smartly-scripted
