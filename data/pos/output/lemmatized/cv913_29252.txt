before
you
read
my
review
,
you
gotta
know
that
i
love
woody
allen
.
this
be
a
very
important
note
because
allen
's
film
be
generally
a
acquire
taste
and
definitely
not
for
everyone
.
i
know
folk
who
believe
he
to
be
a
complete
genius
,
while
other
see
he
as
a
dirty
ol'
schnook
who
keep
make
the
same
movie
over
and
over
again
.
i
love
most
of
he
film
,
but
will
admit
to
have
be
quite
disappoint
by
he
recent
crop
during
the
90
.
in
fact
,
why
he
feel
the
need
to
make
10
movie
in
those
10
year
be
beyond
I
!
if
you
look
at
the
quality
of
those
film
,
you
'll
hear
what
i
be
say
.
the
only
two
film
of
he
that
i
really
like
during
that
time
be
bullet
over
broadway
and
husband
and
wife
.
in
fact
,
i
secretly
hope
that
he
would
take
some
''
time
off
''
at
the
turn
of
the
millennium
,
just
to
re-energize
or
something
,
but
it
do
not
appear
as
though
he
have
any
intention
of
do
that
.
so
here
i
be
again
,
review
yet
another
woody
allen
movie
and
hope
that
it
bring
back
the
woody
from
the
day
of
old
.
plot
:
the
year
be
1940
and
woody
allen
be
a
top-notch
insurance
investigator
.
he
method
be
very
old-fashioned
and
apparently
out
of
date
.
a
new
employee
-lrb-
hunt
-rrb-
have
just
be
hire
to
streamline
the
operation
for
greater
efficiency
.
the
two
do
not
like
each
other
.
one
night
,
they
be
both
put
under
a
hypnotic
trance
by
a
magician
,
and
unbeknownst
to
they
,
place
under
he
control
.
soon
thereafter
,
jewel
be
steal
,
word
of
love
be
exchange
and
everyone
be
look
for
a
answer
.
critique
:
a
wonderful
recreation
of
the
1940s
style
movie
,
with
the
fast-talking
witty
banter
between
co-worker
,
a
catchy
jazz
score
move
thing
along
,
film
noirish
element
such
as
the
veronica
lake-type
sexpot
,
one-liner
galore
and
a
fluffy
,
if
inconsequential
plotline
.
on
the
downside
,
the
film
actually
start
off
pretty
slowly
,
with
the
first
hour
toss
only
a
few
guffaw
out
there
,
but
never
really
generate
any
kind
of
steady
flow
or
energy
.
the
set
,
on
the
other
hand
,
be
amazing
,
the
production
design
and
costume
be
perfect
,
and
the
casting
ideal
,
so
i
keep
hope
that
the
film
would
pick
up
and
not
turn
into
yet
another
mediocre
outing
for
the
man
.
but
it
be
not
not
long
before
i
be
fully
engage
by
the
character
,
entertain
by
the
many
zinger
deliver
back-and-forth
between
allen
and
hunt
,
and
actually
interested
in
the
resolution
of
the
flick
.
i
also
appreciate
how
allen
play
the
fine
line
between
homage
to
the
film
of
old
,
parody
and
actual
reinvention
-lrb-
note
theron
's
entire
female
persona
that
be
drench
in
film
noir
-
very
cool
-rrb-
.
of
course
,
film
like
this
-lrb-
with
little
or
no
real
tension
in
the
plot
-rrb-
need
solid
actor
to
keep
you
interested
in
the
quick-fire
dialogue
,
and
once
again
,
allen
do
a
great
job
in
play
he
character
,
who
for
once
,
be
not
he
typical
new
york
jewish
neurotic
cheating
insecure
husband
dude
.
he
actually
play
a
''
macho
''
guy
here
and
handle
it
pretty
well
,
especially
the
scene
in
which
he
be
hypnotize
.
but
the
bigger
surprise
for
I
in
this
film
be
helen
hunt
,
a
actress
who
i
be
openly
''
sick
of
see
''
in
movie
late
last
year
-lrb-
sorry
babe
,
you
be
just
in
too
many
at
the
same
time
!
-rrb-
.
anyway
,
she
be
really
great
in
this
film
as
the
headstrong
woman
look
to
a
new
era
of
equality
amongst
man
,
and
do
not
miss
a
beat
of
allen
's
fast-paced
dialogue
.
i
do
not
care
much
for
she
run
joke
about
he
''
die
''
whenever
he
leave
a
room
,
but
overall
she
be
really
good
and
i
especially
like
the
way
that
she
sweater
cling
to
she
breast
as
they
do
...
yum
,
yum
!
harumph
,
but
i
digress
.
so
let
's
recap
.
a
great
look
picture
with
a
nice
jazzy
score
,
some
funny
one-liner
,
especially
in
the
second
half
,
a
decent
plotline
,
although
you
should
not
expect
a
real
mystery
or
anything
,
and
some
solid
act
all
around
.
i
can
not
say
that
this
be
even
remotely
close
to
any
of
allen
's
best
work
,
but
i
certainly
believe
it
to
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
,
especially
after
the
dinky
decade
of
film
that
he
just
go
through
.
it
be
probably
better
gear
towards
allen
fan
more
than
anyone
else
,
but
i
would
still
recommend
this
film
to
anyone
look
for
a
cute
,
''
old-school
''
kind
of
vibe
,
with
chemistry
between
the
lead
,
zippy
dialogue
and
a
satisfying
conclusion
.
