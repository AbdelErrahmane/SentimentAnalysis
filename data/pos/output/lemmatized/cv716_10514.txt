while
watch
''
shallow
grave
,
''
i
find
myself
periodically
notice
thematic
similarity
to
the
coen
'
''
blood
simple
.
''
both
be
good
film
in
which
several
character
,
none
of
whom
be
the
most
conscientious
to
have
walk
the
earth
but
still
be
not
really
evil
,
indulge
in
a
act
of
deception
that
soon
necessitate
more
serious
crime
.
the
body
count
rise
,
and
before
long
seemingly
normal
people
have
blood
on
they
hand
.
both
film
be
also
flaw
,
but
for
different
reason
.
''
blood
simple
''
be
unrelentingly
dark
and
moody
,
but
its
characterization
be
a
little
hollow
.
''
shallow
grave
,
''
on
the
other
hand
,
be
nearly
flawless
for
a
hour
and
twenty
minute
,
and
then
the
filmmaker
throw
away
much
of
what
they
would
accomplish
for
a
more
standard
,
audience-pleasing
end
.
the
event
of
the
film
be
sufficiently
intense
and
disturbing
that
i
honestly
feel
quite
trouble
by
what
i
be
witness
on
screen
most
of
the
time
,
yet
there
be
a
slight
grin
on
my
face
at
the
end
.
as
the
film
begin
,
we
be
introduce
to
alex
-lrb-
ewan
mcgregor
-rrb-
,
juliet
-lrb-
kerry
fox
-rrb-
,
and
david
-lrb-
christopher
eccleston
-rrb-
,
a
scottish
trio
living
in
a
apartment
in
glasgow
.
they
be
all
sarcastic
and
occasionally
obnoxious
,
but
other
than
that
they
seem
like
a
fairly
normal
bunch
.
a
man
name
hugo
move
into
the
apartment
's
remain
vacancy
,
and
the
next
morning
he
be
find
dead
of
a
drug
overdose
.
juliet
be
about
to
call
the
police
when
alex
discover
that
hugo
have
bring
with
he
a
suitcase
fill
to
the
brim
with
cash
-lrb-
presumably
from
criminal
activity
-rrb-
.
the
three
eventually
decide
to
keep
the
money
and
cover
up
the
death
;
after
a
drawing
of
straw
,
the
particularly
unenviable
task
of
mutilate
the
body
so
as
to
make
it
unidentifiable
and
bury
it
fall
to
david
,
who
have
be
the
most
reluctant
to
partake
in
the
scheme
from
the
beginning
.
all
of
this
transpire
in
the
first
twenty
minute
or
so
of
the
film
,
and
part
of
what
make
''
shallow
grave
''
so
brilliant
for
a
while
be
that
i
honestly
have
no
idea
what
be
come
next
.
other
than
the
obvious
question
of
why
they
do
not
report
the
death
and
simply
hide
the
cash
,
which
be
not
address
,
the
plot
and
characterization
,
while
sometimes
predictable
,
work
in
a
way
that
keep
my
attention
and
,
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
give
I
chill
.
i
will
,
therefore
,
attempt
to
continue
this
review
in
a
way
that
do
not
give
away
too
much
of
the
plot
.
broadly
,
the
trio
be
in
danger
due
to
hugo
's
underworld
connection
,
as
two
goon
search
for
the
money
and
kill
several
people
in
the
process
.
a
police
inspector
-lrb-
ken
stott
-rrb-
be
clearly
suspicious
and
visit
the
apartment
,
ask
pointed
question
and
try
to
unnerve
the
three
suspect
by
exchange
banal
and
weirdly
humorous
bit
of
dialogue
with
a
junior
detective
.
david
,
meanwhile
,
become
increasingly
paranoid
,
move
into
the
attic
,
and
develop
a
affinity
for
sharp
object
.
director
danny
boyle
effectively
create
a
atmosphere
of
mount
tension
and
suspicion
in
the
apartment
,
and
finally
the
three
seem
ready
to
turn
against
each
other
.
while
i
do
not
consider
myself
the
''
happy
ending
be
automatically
stupid
''
type
,
i
think
that
''
shallow
grave
''
really
should
have
end
in
tragedy
-
a
realistic
analysis
of
the
story
up
to
the
last
ten
minute
of
the
film
would
indicate
that
all
three
character
be
probably
about
to
end
up
in
prison
,
in
the
mental
hospital
,
or
in
the
morgue
.
this
could
have
be
accomplish
,
quite
credibly
,
but
then
boyle
and
screenwriter
john
hodge
seem
to
flinch
and
opt
for
a
more
conventional
''
caper
''
end
in
which
we
get
a
kick
out
of
see
who
outsmart
whom
,
and
nothing
more
.
grant
,
this
be
not
really
a
''
happy
''
end
,
but
it
be
still
pretty
light-hearted
compare
to
what
precede
it
.
i
really
should
not
say
anything
more
about
the
end
as
far
as
detail
go
,
but
let
I
add
that
it
seem
not
only
shallow
and
lazy
but
also
inconsistent
with
the
rest
of
the
film
and
not
very
believable
.
yes
,
this
end
make
I
crack
a
smile
for
a
couple
of
minute
,
but
ultimately
it
leave
I
feeling
as
if
i
would
be
cheat
.
still
,
''
shallow
grave
''
be
brilliant
most
of
the
way
through
,
and
it
do
at
least
meet
the
minimum
requirement
for
a
entertaining
thriller
,
and
i
be
therefore
award
it
three
star
.
i
guess
i
just
can
not
help
but
think
about
that
fourth
star
that
boyle
and
hodge
let
slip
away
.
