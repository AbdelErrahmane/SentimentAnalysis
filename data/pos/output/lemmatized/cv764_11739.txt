i
love
this
movie
,
and
i
have
just
see
for
the
umptenth
time
.
unfortunately
,
it
be
also
completly
unknown
and
very
few
have
see
it
.
it
be
my
mission
in
life
to
spread
the
word
:
see
this
movie
!
fred
,
george
,
doug
and
howie
be
reach
middleage
.
three
of
they
have
a
wife
,
kid
and
a
house
in
the
suburb
with
a
mortgage
to
pay
.
only
fred
be
still
a
bachelor
.
together
they
take
the
local
train
every
morning
to
work
in
town
.
on
one
of
they
organize
Thursday
evening
at
a
bar
,
fred
tell
they
of
he
boss
and
the
arrangement
he
have
make
to
keep
a
mistress
.
he
have
get
a
apartment
in
downtown
where
he
can
meet
she
but
have
tell
he
wife
that
he
need
the
apartment
to
spend
the
night
after
staff
meeting
every
Thursday
night
.
since
they
always
split
everything
four
way
,
they
decide
that
they
should
get
a
apartment
with
a
young
woman
as
well
,
kathy
.
however
,
kathy
be
not
completly
honest
to
they
.
in
fact
,
she
be
a
sociology
student
write
a
thesis
about
the
sex
life
of
the
suburban
male
.
with
these
four
species
she
believe
that
she
will
make
a
very
good
paper
.
ok
,
have
one
thing
clear
though
.
the
romantic
rendezvous
'
between
kathy
and
each
of
the
man
be
completly
innocent
.
the
script
stay
above
the
waist
-
or
to
be
precise
,
above
the
neck
.
noboyd
claim
that
kathy
be
they
mistress
,
the
four
guy
call
she
they
`
companion
'
.
the
censorship
board
here
in
sweden
consider
it
to
be
suitable
only
for
people
above
15
year
,
but
that
only
show
how
long
ago
1962
be
.
small
child
could
watch
this
without
be
corrupt
.
kim
novak
be
as
lovely
as
always
in
this
movie
,
even
if
she
seem
to
be
a
bit
too
old
for
a
student
.
jame
garner
be
the
playboy
just
like
in
many
other
movie
.
i
like
howard
morri
the
best
as
howard
the
accountant
who
have
to
diet
to
support
he
wife
.
tony
randall
be
funny
as
always
.
1962
be
more
than
35
year
ago
.
how
many
accountant
,
copywriter
or
investment
banker
can
today
afford
to
live
in
a
house
in
the
suburb
with
a
lot
of
kid
and
a
wife
who
do
not
work
?
this
be
the
white
middle
class
,
i
can
not
remember
that
i
see
any
black
on
the
commuter
train
they
use
.
these
be
the
people
who
can
count
on
they
kid
to
live
a
even
better
life
than
themselves
.
perhaps
this
should
also
be
a
subject
for
a
thesis
in
movie
sociology
?
