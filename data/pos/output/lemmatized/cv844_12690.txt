''
bulworth
''
be
a
caustic
political
comedy
that
do
not
attack
any
particular
political
group
,
but
rather
the
ingrained
insincerity
that
have
infect
the
american
political
system
.
some
might
think
this
film
be
vulgar
,
and
in
many
way
it
be
.
however
,
as
loud
and
raucous
as
it
be
,
''
bulworth
''
speak
the
truth
,
which
be
almost
always
ugly
to
hear
.
beatty
,
who
direct
the
film
and
co-write
the
script
with
jeremy

jay
billington
bulworth
,
who
have
one
of
the
best
politician
name
in
cinema
history
.
bulworth
be
a
democrat
,
and
in
beatty
's
view
,
he
be
symbolic
of
everything
that
have
go
wrong
with
the
current
democratic
party
.
once
a
ideological
liberal
-lrb-
like
beatty
still
be
-rrb-
,
bulworth
have
long
since
succumb
to
the
materialistic
pressure
of
washington
.
instead
of
wage
the
battle
for
the
impoverished
and
the
downtrodden
,
which
be
once
the
call
card
of
democrat
,
bulworth
have
become
another
sell-out
money
hound
-
if
he
be
not
accept
illegal
bribe
from
the
insurance
lobby
or
take
campaign
contribution
from
the
chinese
,
he
be
make
wind-bag
speech
that
start
with
the
amusingly
clintonesqe
statement
,
''
america
be
stand
on
the
doorstep
of
a
new
millennium
...
blah
,
blah
,
blah
.
''
when
the
film
open
,
it
be
a
few
day
before
the
1996
primary
election
,
and
bulworth
be
sit
at
he
desk
weep
because
he
realize
how
corrupt
he
have
become
.
in
a
fit
of
desperation
,
he
take
out
a
$
10
million
life
insurance
policy
from
a
dirty
insurance
rep
play
by
paul
sorvino
-lrb-
part
of
a
shady
lobby
deal
to
kill
a
threatening
bill
in
committee
-rrb-
,
and
then
hire
a
hit
man
to
kill
he
,
although
he
do
not
know
who
the
assassin
will
be
,
or
when
the
hit
will
take
place
.
know
that
he
will
soon
be
dead
,
bulworth
unleash
he
own
brand
of
political
rhetoric
on
the
world
,
which
be
make
up
of
politically
incorrect
truth
about
the
state
of
american
politics
and
the
society
in
general
.
at
a
compton
church
,
he
tell
the
group
of
african-american
that
they
will
have
no
power
in
the
u
.
s
.
unless
they
''
put
down
that
malt
liquor
and
chicken
wing
,
and
get
behind
somebody
other
than
a
run
back
who
stab
he
wife
.
''
later
,
in
a
particularly
hilarious
sequence
,
bulworth
mix
with
the
hollywood
elite
,
then
insult
the
quality
of
they
movie
and
inform
they
that
the
only
reason
he
be
there
be
because
''
my
guy
always
put
the
big
jew
on
my
schedule
.
''
all
throughout
this
physically
and
politically
suicidal
escapade
,
bulworth
's
chief
of
staff
,
denni
murphy
-lrb-
oliver
platt
-rrb-
,
follow
behind
in
a
state
of
constant
shock
and
bewilderment
.
platt
have
some
of
the
movie
's
funniest
scene
,
as
he
make
murphy
into
a
politically
savvy
but
nonetheless
clueless
assistant
who
be
force
to
watch
he
own
career
teeter
at
the
brink
of
be
flush
down
the
toilet
.
he
constant
half-truth-telling
and
spin-doctoring
to
cover
bulworth
's
stampede
be
equal
in
its
perversion
only
by
a
self-righteous
reporter
-lrb-
nora
dunn
-rrb-
who
act
like
murphy
's
refusal
to
explain
bulworth
's
action
-lrb-
something
he
really
can
not
do
-rrb-
be
somehow
a
act
of
treason
.
when
bulworth
decide
he
want
to
live
after
all
,
and
therefore
must
constantly
evade
a
grim-looking
assassin
to
be
who
be
trail
he
at
every
turn
,
he
hide
out
in
the
ghetto
,
complete
with
a
stereotypical
gangsta
wardrobe
which
he
wear
to
one
of
he
television
interview
.
at
this
point
,
beatty
abandon
much
of
the
political
aspect
and
dive
into
a
cartoonish
exploration
of
the
black
inner-city
experience
.
bulworth
become
friendly
with
a
young
black
woman
name
nina
-lrb-
halle
berry
-rrb-
,
who
he
meet
at
the
harlem
church
rally
.
she
have
a
tough-talking
brother
who
be
deep
in
debt
to
a
local
gangster
name
l
.
d
.
-lrb-
don
cheadle
of
''
boogie
night
''
-rrb-
,
who
also
become
involve
in
bulworth
's
campaign
.
some
of
the
scene
in
the
ghetto
ring
true
,
but
much
of
it
feel
like
a
lighter
version
of
scene
depict
in
more
intense
inner-city
film
like
''
boyz
'n'
hood
''
-lrb-
1991
-rrb-
and
''
menace
ii
society
''
-lrb-
1993
-rrb-
.
''
bulworth
's
''
chief
liability
be
beatty
's
insistence
on
have
he
character
adopt
a
clumsy
style
of
rap
as
he
new
communication
device
.
instead
of
speak
at
political
rally
,
he
break
into
a
kind
of
rhythmless
rap
style
that
be
a
reminder
of
why
almost
all
hip-hop
star
be
black
.
it
be
hard
to
tell
whether
beatty
be
be
humorous
by
be
so
bad
,
or
whether
he
be
actually
that
incompetent
.
at
any
rate
,
the
rap
sound
more
run
d
.
m
.
c
.
than
snoop
doggy
dogg
,
which
make
the
film
seem
date
instead
of
contemporary
.
beatty
would
have
be
better
off
simply
adopt
some
of
the
inner-city
lingo
and
work
that
into
he
speech
,
instead
of
try
to
sound
like
l
.
l
.
cool
j
.
other
than
that
,
''
bulworth
''
hit
all
its
target
with
wry
,
hilarious
accuracy
.
the
film
be
like
a
letter
bomb
to
the
democratic
party
,
and
even
if
you
do
not
agree
with
beatty
's
liberal
message
about
the
unrequited
duty
of
the
federal
government
,
it
be
hard
to
deny
the
impact
the
film
have
in
explore
the
monetary
and
moral
debauchery
that
infest
modern
politics
.
unlike
''
primary
color
''
which
open
earlier
this
year
,
''
bulworth
''
do
not
try
to
tip-toe
around
the
truly
painful
issue
that
hit
close
to
home
-
instead
,
it
take
they
dead-on
.
