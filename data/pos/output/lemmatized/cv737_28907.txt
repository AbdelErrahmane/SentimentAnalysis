at

the

begin
to
falter
during
the

20

,
a
sequence
that
seem
most
spielbergian
with
image
that
appear
to
be
borrow
from
close
encounter
.
it
be
all
very
anti-climatic
and
jarring
.
these
scene
seem
almost
superfluous
,
as
if
from
a
different
film
.
a

i

be
a
dark
fairy

that
deserve
its
pg-13
rating

it
be
a
story
combine
hope

intolerance

sacrifice
and
bigotry
,
and
while
it
do
not
coalesce
perfectly
,
the
movie
do
offer
some
disturbing

a

i

be
really
a
showcase
for
the
act
talent
of
the
amazing
young
osment

if
ever
a
actor
deserve
a
academy
award
nomination
,
it
be
this

who
bring
a
sense
of
joy

wonder
to
the
role
of
david

the

robot
who
really
do
not
understand
david
's
quest
,
but
be
nonetheless
happy
to

on

probably
the
toughest
role
be
o'connor
's

play
a
emotional
fragile

who
see
david

and
you

-
even

-
how
it
would
have
turn
out
with

instead
of
spielberg
behind
the
camera
.
would
it
have
be
darker
?
more
cynical
?
we

never

we
