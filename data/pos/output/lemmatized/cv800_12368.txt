those
of
you
who
frequently
read
my
review
be
not
likely
to
be
surprise
by
the
fact
that
i
have
not
read
victor
hugo
's
novel
les
miserables
.
i
do
not
know
if
a
lot
of
people
have
,
though
i
imagine
many
be
familiar
with
the
popular
musical
base
on
the
novel
.
i
have
not
even
see
that
.
go
into
this
film
,
i
have
almost
no
knowledge
of
the
story
or
its
character
-lrb-
i
even
expect
the
film
to
be
a
musical
-rrb-
.
walk
away
from
it
,
i
be
kind
of
glad
i
have
no
prior
experience
with
the
material
.
writer\/director
bille
August
's
film
version
be
a
straightforward
,
beautifully
tell
film
.
liam
neeson
star
as
the
miserable
jean
valjean
;
in
the
beginning
,
he
have
just
be
release
from
a
19-year
prison
sentence
.
he
be
allow
to
stay
in
a
convent
by
a
kindly
priest
despite
he
rude
and
destructive
behavior
.
the
priest
's
word
of
wisdom
influence
he
,
and
he
make
a
vow
to
change
himself
.
nine
year
later
,
we
be
inform
that
he
be
now
the
mayor
of
a
town
call
vigo
;
nobody
know
he
real
name
,
and
that
he
be
want
for
skip
he
parole
nine
year
ago
.
conflict
arise
when
inspector
javert
-lrb-
geoffrey
rush
-rrb-
be
assign
to
vigo
.
valjean
remember
javert
as
one
of
the
prison
guard
who
constantly
beat
he
,
and
javert
remember
jean
to
be
a
convict
.
javert
be
hell-bent
on
uphold
the
law
,
and
he
do
everything
in
he
power
to
bring
jean
to
justice
.
along
the
way
,
valjean
meet
and
fall
in
love
with
a
peasant
woman
,
fantine
-lrb-
uma
thurman
-rrb-
,
and
vow
to
take
care
of
she
daughter
,
cosette
-lrb-
play
later
by
claire
dane
-rrb-
.
les
miserables
be
visually
a
solid
and
often
striking
picture
.
the
production
design
by
anna
asp
be
authentic
and
vast
,
and
the
set
do
not
look
like
set
-lrb-
they
look
like
real
town
and
village
-rrb-
;
gabriellum
pescuccus
's
costume
be
noticeably
spectacular
.
basil
poledouri
'
soundtrack
be
thick
and
usually
well-placed
-lrb-
though
it
do
get
a
bit
heavy
at
time
-rrb-
.
many
scene
in
the
film
have
a
memorable
photographic
quality
,
such
as
the
climax
,
which
take
place
next
to
a
dark
river
in
the
gray
obscurity
of
early
evening
.
august
keep
the
story
simple
-lrb-
which
i
hear
be
a
good
thing
,
since
the
novel
be
so
complex
-rrb-
and
easy
to
follow
.
he
manage
to
develop
the
main
character
and
most
of
the
subplot
adequately
.
i
be
also
impressed
that
he
do
not
go
overboard
with
flash
and
style
,
which
be
something
so
many
director
seem
to
be
do
to
classic
story
these
day
-lrb-
such
as
baz
luhrmann
's
vicious
tragedy
william
shakespeare
's
romeo
+
juliet
-rrb-
.
this
film
feel
solid
and
whole
,
and
each
scene
have
a
certain
amount
of
importance
and
vigor
that
keep
the
audience
interested
.
liam
neeson
be
terrific
in
the
main
role
;
neeson
be
the
kind
of
actor
who
do
solemn
desperation
extremely
well
,
and
valjean
be
certainly
a
man
who
clearly
fit
that
adjective
.
thurman
,
in
she
small
role
,
be
very
good
,
and
prove
that
she
have
a
lot
of
range
and
can
perform
in
a
very
non-glamorous
role
such
as
this
one
.
rush
be
absolutely
incredible
as
javert
;
i
do
not
remember
ever
feel
so
strongly
about
a
villain
as
i
do
here
;
he
add
depth
and
complexity
with
subtle
glance
and
nuance
,
and
effortlessly
make
each
of
he
scene
intense
.
i
can
not
be
as
charitable
for
dane
,
however
;
though
i
know
she
be
a
talented
actress
,
here
she
tend
to
overact
when
it
might
have
be
better
to
underplay
the
character
a
bit
.
les
miserables
be
,
as
i
have
say
,
a
solid
,
intelligent
motion
picture
.
my
only
complaint
be
that
it
feel
a
bit
too
easy
,
and
perhaps
too
stage
.
each
scene
be
grand
and
huge
,
and
explode
with
poledouri
'
score
,
but
i
do
not
always
want
they
to
be
.
for
the
most
part
,
les
miserables
be
not
a
subtle
or
deep
picture
.
it
be
a
good
movie
,
and
tell
its
story
well
,
but
August
tend
to
hand-feed
we
theme
and
scene
that
would
have
work
better
have
they
be
more
subtle
.
however
,
in
a
film
this
exciting
and
well-produced
,
a
few
minor
flaw
be
easily
overlook
.
