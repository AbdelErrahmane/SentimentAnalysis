it
be
not
often
that
i
laugh
so
hard
at
a
movie
that
my
head
hurt
.
but
that
be
just
what
happen
to
I
at
uhf
,
weird
al
yankovic
's
big
screen
debut
.
uhf
be
a
television
parody
a
la
airplane
,
and
like
airplane
,
the
movie
be
extraordinarily
stupid
.
but
it
be
dumb
in
the
best
way
a
movie
can
be
dumb
:
it
be
so
silly
and
outrageous
it
be
hilarious
.
the
movie
star
weird
al
as
george
newman
,
a
world
class
nerd
with
a
hyperactive
imagination
,
the
type
who
fantasize
he
be
indiana
jone
and
who
use
hostess
twinky
as
hot
dog
bun
.
george
be
basically
a
loser
;
he
daydream
and
smart-alec
attitude
perpetually
prevent
he
from
hold
onto
a
job
for
more
than
two
week
.
but
george
finally
get
a
chance
to
funnel
he
creativity
into
something
productive
when
he
uncle
win
channel
62
in
a
poker
game
and
make
he
the
general
manager
of
the
struggle
uhf
television
station
.
george
revive
channel
62
with
innovative
programming
:
show
like
''
wheel
of
fish
''
and
movie
like
''
conan
,
the
librarian
.
''
as
the
station
's
rating
rise
,
it
come
into
competition
with
channel
8
,
the
lead
vhf
network-affiliate
.
as
r
.
j
.
fletcher
--
channel
8
's
ill-natured
,
hard-nosed
owner
--
veteran
stage
and
film
actor
kevin
mccarthy
be
flamboyantly
sleazy
;
he
really
ham
it
up
with
he
snort
,
grimace
,
and
scowl
.
uhf
satirize
anything
and
everything
to
do
with
television
,
include
game
show
,
tabloid
talk
show
,
child
's
show
,
dizzy
news
woman
,
and
movie
--
everything
from
rambo
to
close
encounter
.
the
funniest
scene
,
the
one
that
make
my
head
spin
,
be
a
commercial
for
spatula
which
have
to
be
see
to
be
believe
.
like
most
movie
in
its
genre
,
uhf
be
hit
or
miss
.
for
every
gag
that
work
,
at
least
one
fizzle
.
for
instance
,
weird
al
's
mock
video
of
''
money
for
nothing
''
by
dire
strait
be
only
mildly
amusing
and
bring
the
film
to
a
grind
halt
-lrb-
although
it
do
have
some
nifty
computer
animation
-rrb-
.
but
the
funniest
bit
in
uhf
be
so
hysterical
that
we
can
forgive
the
one
that
fail
;
we
know
another
gut
wrencher
be
on
the
way
.
in
fact
,
uhf
hit
the
mark
often
enough
to
make
it
the
most
effective
airplane-type
movie
since
...
well
,
since
airplane
.
much
of
the
credit
go
to
weird
al
's
exceptionally
inventive
script
and
to
the
movie
's
winsome
cast
.
weird
al
seem
a
little
stiff
at
the
beginning
,
but
because
he
be
not
afraid
to
look
silly
,
he
ultimately
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
he
character
.
the
real
standout
be
michael
richard
as
stanley
,
the
dim-witted
janitor
who
become
the
host
of
he
own
child
's
show
:
''
stanley
spadowskus
's
playhouse
.
''
stanley
's
off-beat
,
mixed-up
personality
be
a
big
hit
with
the
audience
and
make
he
a
over-night
star
.
he
be
a
endearing
mixture
of
good-natured
innocence
,
high-energy
enthusiasm
,
and
puppy-dog
cuteness
.
and
above
all
,
he
be
a
good
janitor
who
adore
he
work
.
another
highlight
be
a
vintage
cameo
by
the
incomparable
emo
philip
.
the
cast
also
feature
gedde
watanabe
-lrb-
the
chinese
foreign-exchange
student
in
sixteen
candle
-rrb-
as
the
karate
master
who
host
the
hit
series
,
''
wheel
of
fish
.
''
also
aboard
for
the
ride
be
fran
drescher
,
who
play
pamelum
finklestein
,
channel
62
's
rove
reporter
.
unfortunately
,
as
weird
al
's
girlfriend
,
victorium
jackson
be
waste
in
a
role
that
call
for
nothing
but
whimpering
,
whine
,
and
sulk
.
she
character
be
extraneous
and
should
have
be
either
further
integrate
into
the
story
or
cut
from
the
script
altogether
.
while
uhf
be
not
a
absolute
must-see
,
it
be
definitely
the
ticket
if
you
be
look
for
a
wild
and
zany
,
whacked-out
comedy
.
the
movie
be
good
enough
to
see
in
the
theater
,
but
it
may
work
even
better
on
television
,
the
very
medium
at
which
it
poke
fun
.
