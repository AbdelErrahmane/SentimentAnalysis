since
most
movie
about
slavery
shield
we
from
the
true
horror
of
what
they
be
portray
,
it
be
fitting
to
say
that
''
beloved
''
come
as
a
real
shock
as
a
film
.
it
be
confusing
,
bizarre
,
and
as
tough
a
film
to
watch
as
any
film
i
have
see
all
year
,
and
that
be
not
necessarily
because
of
the
three-hour
run
time
.
''
beloved
''
be
challenge
to
watch
,
fill
with
tough
and
powerful
poetry
that
take
we
completely
off
guard
,
and
instead
of
a
straight-forward
,
hollywood-ized
story
about
what
happen
to
the
slave
after
they
be
free
,
''
beloved
''
come
off
as
a
cry
of
anguish
from
all
those
who
actually
live
through
what
happen
-lrb-
or
,
rather
,
tonus
morrison
,
who
write
the
novel
upon
which
this
be
base
-rrb-

''

tell
the
story
of
a
ex-slave
name

a
couple
year
pass
,
and
the
ghost
remain
,
and
one
day
,
a
man
name
paul

,
another
ex-slave
who
know
sethe

ago
when
they

a
plantation
together

,
ask
for
lodging
.
he
have
be
wander
around
since
he
leave
the
plantation
,
and
when
he
enter
the
house
,
it
turn
red
and
become
incredibly
hot
.
when
he
remark
about
what
he
think
be
evil
,
sethe
reply
''
it
be
not
evil
.
it
be
just
sad
.
''
some
more
time
pass
,
and
paul

have
become
a
fervent
member
of
the
household
,
and
the
ghost
disappear
.
but
when
they
return
one
day
from
go
out
,
they
discover
a
young
woman
sit
in
the
house
.
she
name
be
beloved
,
and
as
play
by
thandie
newton
,
she
have
almost
zero
motor
skill
.
she
stumble
around
,
half-grabbing
onto
thing
and
knock
they
over
,
and
when
she
speak
,
she
let
out
a
low
guttural
sound
that
eventually
turn
into
baby
talk
.
they
let
she
into
she
house
,
and
she
begin
to
turn
thing
upside
down
.
''
beloved
''
act
like
a
incredibly
difficult
chamber
drama
pair
with
a
ghost
story
.
most
of
the
scene
consist
of
people
argue
in
one
claustrophobic
,
low-lit
room
,
with
the
occasional
flash
to
the
past
,
where
we
see
image
of
such
horror
that
we
thank
god
for
modern-day
psychoanalyst
.
sethe
and
paul
d
have
live
through
such
hellish
time
that
they
be
forever
implant
with
the
memory
of
they
slavehood
on
the
old
plantation
,
which
include
such
image
as
sethe
be
rape
by
the
white
plantation
hand
,
with
she
nipple
be
lick
,
prompt
she
to
cry
out
to
paul
d
when
reminisce
about
it
,
''
they
take
my
milk
!
''
worst
of
all
be
the
month
after
she
freedom
,
when
she
be
allow
to
live
like
a
free
person
,
work
with
other
black
on
a
farm
,
and
then
see
that
she
old
plantation
owner
have
arrive
to
presumedly
take
she
and
she
child
back
.
she
run
to
the
barn
near
by
,
carry
she
four
child
,
and
when
she
old
owner
burst
in
,
they
discover
she
have
murder
one
of
they
and
be
ready
to
murder
the
rest
of
they
if
they
do
not
leave
they
alone
.
when
she
be
inquire
about
this
moment
by
paul
d
in
a
moment
halfway
through
the
film
,
she
say
she
do
not
regret
it
.
she
kill
she
daughter
so
that
she
would
not
have
to
live
through
the
horror
she
do
,
and
she
have
convince
herself
she
do
the
right
thing
.
of
course
,
beloved
be
really
she
daugher
materialize
,
though
we
be
not
flat
out
tell
that
until
later
on
in
the
film
.
beloved
represent
the
pain
and
suffer
the
slave
go
through
and
show
how
difficult
it
be
for
they
to
deal
with
they
freedom
after
be
tortured
for
so
long
.
thus
,
''
beloved
''
become
a
sorta-redux
of
the
andreus
tarkofsky
sci-fi
classic
,
''
solari
,
''
where
a
cosmonaut
discover
that
he
wife
,
who
commit
suicide
year
before
,
have
materialize
when
he
be
orbit
over
a
planet
with
a
complex
brain
system
.
that
film
speak
volume
about
humanity
and
we
memory
,
how
we
be
constantly
regret
what
happen
in
the
past
,
and
when
if
it
ever
literally
come
back
to
haunt
we
,
it
would
control
we
completely
.
''
beloved
''
move
along
freely
,
without
a
lot
of
explanation
,
and
for
the
most
part
,
this
be
extremely
respectable
.
the
most
interesting
film
be
the
one
that
do
not
explain
everything
for
we
,
leave
gap
in
the
character
that
we
be
suppose
to
fill
in
with
how
they
act
in
the
present
tense
.
sethe
be
never
fully
explain
as
a
character
,
but
we
understand
all
she
action
since
she
be
be
play
by
oprah
winfrey
.
it
be
be
well
over
a
decade
since
she
last
major
performance
in
''
the
color
purple
,
''
but
judge
from
these
two
film
,
i
'll
bet
she
be
one
of
the
best
actress
work
today
...
if
she
be
strictly
a
actress
.
she
talk
show
,
which
i
suppose
be
a
great
entity
,
have
prevent
she
from
become
a
noteworthy
actress
,
and
that
be
a
shame
because
she
bring
so
much
to
this
movie
.
emotion
.
sadness
.
strength
.
watch
the
strong
sethe
,
who
be
so
afraid
of
the
past
that
she
be
build
a
rather
strong
protective
coating
around
herself
,
break
down
when
she
discover
who
beloved
really
be
be
what
make
this
movie
really
great
.
she
make
it
real
.
that
be
not
to
say
this
be
a
perfect
film
.
in
fact
,
i
would
wager
to
say
that
the
fact
that
it
be
confusing
and
painful
to
watch
be
what
prevent
this
from
be
the
truly
great
film
it
be
.
while
oprah
's
performance
be
powerful
and
easily
sympathetic
-lrb-
and
i
be
die
to
see
she
win
at
least
a
oscar
nomination
this
February
-rrb-
,
the
structure
of
the
film
,
which
do
not
show
what
happen
to
she
child
till
halfway
through
the
film
,
prevent
we
from
really
make
a
cohesive
connection
to
the
film
.
it
do
not
necessarily
move
as
though
they
be
memory
of
one
particular
character
,
and
by
the
end
,
it
have
lose
control
over
sethe
,
and
as
she
take
to
bed
,
we
be
unable
to
truly
identify
with
she
anymore
.
but
despite
its
tediousness
,
perhaps
that
be
the
point
.
the
distancing
by
the
end
of
the
film
may
be
just
part
of
the
way
it
have
be
build
from
the
start
,
since
they
figure
she
have
cross
over
from
be
identifiable
,
and
it
need
to
get
back
with
reality
.
and
for
the
most
part
,
this
film
seem
like
the
cry
of
pain
from
the
slave
that
it
really
want
to
be
.
jonathan
demme
's
direction
be
bizarre
,
in
nature
with
the
story
,
and
he
create
the
right
mood
,
make
it
a
tough
film
to
sit
through
,
make
sure
that
the
audience
feel
as
uncomfortable
as
the
character
.
there
be
more
to
admire
here
,
like
the
way
that
the
flashback
pop
up
freely
and
without
real
organization
,
just
like
they
would
be
in
real
life
;
and
the
way
that
the
end
leave
it
somewhat
open
to
more
pain
and
suffering
,
but
lace
with
a
touch
of
optimism
.
the
act
,
not
only
from
winfrey
,
be
amazing
,
and
i
anticipate
not
only
she
will
get
a
oscar
nomination
.
everyone
have
be
rave
about
thandie
newton
's
performance
,
and
how
it
should
be
reward
.
however
,
it
must
be
note
that
out
of
everyone
,
she
have
the
easiest
part
.
act
like
a
baby
.
throw
thing
.
stumble
around
.
chew
food
with
you
mouth
open
.
i
do
think
there
be
another
performance
worthy
of
oscar
conisderation
,
but
it
be
kimberly
elise
,
as
the
daugher
who
have
to
stay
sensible
and
sane
,
and
have
to
carry
the
burden
of
she
mother
's
loss
of
reality
towards
the
end
.
it
be
not
that
newton
be
not
great
:
she
be
as
annoying
and
wacky
as
the
role
demand
.
it
be
just
that
elise
have
the
tougher
job
and
pull
it
off
even
better
.
despite
the
fact
that
this
film
have
winfrey
write
all
over
it
,
and
not
that
of
writer
morrison
or
director
demme
,
''
beloved
''
have
still
not
do
well
.
cost
,
i
think
,
around
ninety
million
dollar
,
it
have
since
gross
about
twenty-two
.
unfortunately
,
this
film
be
a
little
too
intense
for
viewer
,
even
for
I
,
and
i
can
stand
almost
anything
-lrb-
i
recently
view
the
2Â 1\/2
hour
long
epic
''
caligulum
,
''
the
worst
film
i
have
ever
see
in
my
life
,
and
do
it
in
a
mere
2
sitting
-rrb-
.
although
i
respect
''
beloved
,
''
i
can
not
say
that
i
really
enjoy
it
.
