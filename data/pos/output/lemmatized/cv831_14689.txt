`
you

know
all
about

'
with
these
word
,
we
be
bring
into
the
world
of
a
sultry
vampire
seductress

name
of
lilith

.
make
into
a
immortal
a
century
and
a
half
ago
by
the
sinister
ethan
blake
,
she
continue
to
alleviate
boredom
with
she
state
of
be
.
so
,
what
be
a
undead
girl
to
do
,
except
squeeze
into
the
tightest
fitting
clothes
possible
,
get
out
she
gun
,
seduce
a
few
guy
,
and
kill
a
few
people
for
money
and
blood
?
with
that
out
of
the
way
,
let
I
say
this
.
this
film
be
bad
.
this
film
be
really
,
really
bad
.
yet
somehow
,
it
be
strangely
enjoyable
.
with
all
the
element
of
a
direct
to
video
horror
flick
?
buxom
babe
,
gore
,
cheesy
dialogue
,
and
bad
act
?
any
casual
film
viewer
would
be
more
inclined
to
spend
they
money
on
rent
innocent
blood
or
go
to
see
blade
.
still
,
it
be
consider
to
be
one
of
the
finest
british
vampire
film
.
agree
,
it
might
be
,
but
be
far
from
be
the
best
vampire
flick
ever
.
period
.
razor
blade
smile
have
some
rather
high
production
value
,
show
by
the
nice
overall
tone
to
the
film
.
the
film
be
also
a
bit
of
a
departure
from
popular
vampire
lore
,
with
a
vampire
that
can
go
out
in
broad
daylight
without
disintegrate
,
do
not
sleep
in
a
coffin
-lrb-
but
leave
one
next
to
she
computer
-rrb-
,
and
see
religion
as
the
`
opium
of
the
people
'
-lrb-
hence
,
immunity
to
cross
-rrb-
.
but
aside
from
that
,
it
do
not
stray
too
far
away
from
horror
film
convention
.
that
be
,
unless
that
be
intentional
.
razor
blade
smile
literally
go
for
the
throat
,
then
pump
the
wound
full
of
process
cheese
.
you
can
not
help
but
laugh
when
a
female
vampire
get
decapitate
and
she
sever
head
go
fly
into
a
puddle
.
you
'll
laugh
even
harder
at
the
hideously
contrived
situation
-lrb-
to
distract
two
female
guard
,
lilith
toss
a
cellular
phone
towards
they
and
dial
the
number
-rrb-
.
you
'll
laugh
the
hardest
when
a
murder
witness
recant
the
tale
and
suddenly
start
sob
uncontrollably
.
and
then
,
there
be
the
sudden
twist
end
-lrb-
i
have
enough
heart
not
to
give
it
away
-rrb-
.
the
film
refuse
to
take
itself
seriously
,
which
be
a
good
thing
,
as
by
the
time
lilith
zip
up
she
skin-tight
body
suit
and
then
unzip
it
just
to
show
the
right
amount
of
cleavage
,
you
have
most
likely
forget
the
main
point
of
the
story
.
but
in
case
you
really
care
,
she
be
be
assign
to
kill
a
bunch
of
people
who
belong
to
the
so-called
illuminatus
,
and
she
be
leave
a
huge
mess
behind
for
the
police
to
find
.
as
much
as
my
criticism
,
this
movie
work
best
as
a
guilty
pleasure
or
as
a
film
that
you
watch
with
you
friend
and
within
group
.
almost
destine
for
cult-status
,
the
film
's
campy
,
cheesy
overtone
actually
work
towards
the
film
.
while
this
may
not
necessarily
be
the
film
you
would
want
to
be
see
watch
by
yourself
,
it
make
for
a
fun
time
at
the
movie
.
