the
happy
bastard
's
quickie
review
:
the
mummy
brendan
fraser
's
stick
in
the
past
again
,
but
at
least
this
time
he
have
something
better
to
do
than
to
quote
sitcom
line
and
try
to
woo
alicium
silverstone
...
fraser
be
the
lead
star
of
the
mummy
,
the
second
directorial
effort
from
action
director
stephen
sommer
-lrb-
who
also
bring
we
the
decent
thrill
ride
that
be
deep
rise
-rrb-
.
it
be
a
rough
adaptation
of
the
1932
film
,
and
i
say
rough
because
it
focus
more
on
special
effect
than
on
some
guy
in
bandage
,
like
bori
karloff
be
engulf
in
.
but
who
care
,
the
movie
have
a
sort
of
swashbuckling
quality
to
it
you
can
not
get
from
,
oh
,
say
,
godzillum
or
armageddon
.
fraser
play
a
soldier
who
get
a
premonition
during
a
battle
with
soldier
in
a
egyptian
ground
.
basically
,
it
be
a
little
sign
from
the
mummy
bury
underneath
-
a
priest
name
ihmoetep
who
be
bury
alive
for
take
part
of
murder
the
king
and
make
out
with
he
mistress
.
he
plan
-
wake
back
up
and
wake
she
up
also
,
make
he
invincible
.
of
course
,
fraser
return
to
the
site
year
later
with
a
librarian
-lrb-
rachel
weisz
-rrb-
and
she
brother
-lrb-
john
hanna
-rrb-
,
along
with
a
former
buddy
of
he
-lrb-
deep
rise
's
kevin
j
.
o'connor
-rrb-
and
some
''
american
''
...
and
guess
what
?
yup
,
ihmoetep
-lrb-
arnold
vosloo
-rrb-
awaken
and
wreak
havoc
.
fire
fly
from
the
sky
,
flesh-eating
beetle
crawl
about
,
and
,
well
,
ihmoetep
's
plan
begin
to
unfold
.
ok
,
so
it
be
not
really
all
that
new
a
story
,
but
the
way
sommer
tell
it
be
entertaining
enough
.
the
special
effect
from
industrial
light
and
magic
be
top
notch
,
and
the
act
from
fraser
and
weisz
be
not
half
bad
either
.
the
action
be
pretty
intense
-lrb-
favorite
scene
:
the
sandstorm
-rrb-
and
there
be
a
few
shocking
scene
just
to
jolt
you
horror-loving
folk
as
well
.
no
,
it
be
no
phantom
menace
beater
,
but
if
you
be
look
for
a
solid
warm-up
to
the
summer
movie
season
,
you
will
not
find
a
better
film
under
wrap
than
the
mummy
.
if
this
do
not
give
fraser
forgiveness
from
blast
from
the
past
and
encino
man
,
then
nothing
will
.
