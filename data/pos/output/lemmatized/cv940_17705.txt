when
i
first
see
the
preview
for
ron
howard
's
latest
film
,
my
expectation
be
discouragingly
low
.
a
show
about
nothing
?
sound
like
''
seinfeld
.
''
a
guy
whose
entire
life
be
broadcast
24
hour
a
day
?
sound
like
''
the
truman
show
.
''
what
be
it
with
hollywood
that
no
sooner
than
one
production
company
put
out
a
animated
feature
about
ant
,
another
put
one
out
about
bug
?
which
be
why
i
be
pleasantly
surprise
by
''
edtv
,
''
which
turn
out
to
be
a
fresh
,
insightful
,
and
often
time
hilarious
film
about
the
folly
of
instant
celebrity
.
the
writing
,
by
howard
's
longtime
collaborator
lowell
ganz
and
babaloo
mandel
,
be
right
on
the
money
and
howard
himself
should
be
credit
for
give
the
subject
matter
a
fresh
focus
.
in
the
hand
of
a
less-experienced
director
,
''
edtv
''
could
easily
have
have
all
the
flavor
of
yesterday
's
meatloaf

up
with
the
idea
of
put
a
nobody
on
the
air
and
broadcast
he
every
waking
and
sleep
moment
.
the
hook
be
to
find
a
regular

,
someone
normal
that
people
can
relate
to
.
while

but
on
watch
the
videotape

producer
be
more
take
with

than
with

.
he
be
cute
,
he
say
all
the
wrong

give
the
show
a
week
to
deliver

it
be
tough

in

that
happen
be

one
of

when
a

you
get
the
idea

but
soon
enough
,
thing
--
nielsen-boosting
kind
of
thing
--
start
to
happen
to
this
unassuming

a
negative

and
what
little
dignity

who
should
ed
go
out
with
?
you
can
be
sure
the
pollster
have
a
list
.
not
only
be
the
film
exceedingly
well
cast
,
but
its
performer
be
consistently
excellent
.
matthew
mcconaughey
provide
the
face
,
the
body
language
,
and
the
lovable
texan
accent
to
fill
the
shoe
of
america
's
latest
phenomenon
.
he
and
harrelson
look
like
they
really
could
be
brother
.
sally
kirkland
be
noteworthy
in
a
difficult
role
as
ed
's
mother
,
and
martin
landau
be
one
of
the
film
's
highlight
as
al
,
ed
's
ail
stepfather
.
jenna
elfman
-lrb-
from
tv
's
''
dharma
and
greg
''
-rrb-
prove
herself
surprisingly
worthy
in
the
company
of
kirkland
and
landau
,
although
those
alpine
eyebrow
of
hers
get
a
little
distracting
.
even
degenere
and
reiner
be
better
than
you
would
expect
.
in
1979
,
writer\/director\/comedian
albert
brook
make
a
zany
little
film
call
''
real
life
''
in
which
a
small-time
opportunist
make
a
real-time
documentary
about
a
typical
american
family
.
the
scene
of
ed
's
family
sit
around
the
dinner
table
feast
on
kentucky
fried
chicken
and
wax
idiotic
play
like
a
big-budget
variant
on
that
film
,
parallel
its
wickedly
inventive
humor
.
as
with
most
film
by
albert
brook
,
''
real
life
''
be
funny
,
but
absurd
.
the
funniest
--
and
scariest
--
thing
about
''
edtv
''
be
that
it
be
absolutely
believable
.
