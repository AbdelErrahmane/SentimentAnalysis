imagine
this
.
you
be
give
a
sword
and
a
shield
and
very
basic
,
minimal
training
.
a
man
you
do
not
know
tell
you
that
this
will
be
the
last
day
that
you
will
live
.
you
be
throw
into
a
arena
with
thousand
of
spectator
want
to
see
you
die
.
you
frantically
monitor
several
closed
door
which
,
in
seconds
,
will
release
vicious
enemy
prepare
to
destroy
you
.
you
watch
as
the
innocent
friend
you
make
in
the
last
few
day
be
murder
in
cold
blood
.
if
you
be
lucky
enough
to
survive
this
chaos
throw
at
you
,
you
know
you
be
go
to
have
to
do
it
all
over
again
tomorrow
.
eventually
know
matter
how
strong
or
skilled
you
be
,
you
be
go
to
die
.
this
be
the
life
of
a
gladiator
.
you
'll
never
have
to
be
a
gladiator
and
after
see
ridley
scott
's
powerful
gladiator
,
you
'll
be
thankful
for
that
.
with
he
new
film
,
scott
have
return
cinema
to
the
fascinating
age
of
the
ancient
roman
empire
.
and
like
those
precede
it
,
spartacus
and
ben
hur
,
gladiator
have
nearly
everything
go
for
it
-
a
strong
lead
actor
,
a
wonderful
support
cast
,
eye-catching
special
effect
,
and
a
great
script
.
since
the
two
aforementioned
film
come
out
before
the
prime
target
viewer
of
gladiator
-lrb-
teenager
to
thirty-year-old
male
-rrb-
be
around
,
a
whole
new
genre
may
just
be
reborn
and
revisit
.
-rrb-
from
a
weak
beginning
,
the
film
start
off
extremely
gloomy
and
inauspicious
.
rome
's
best
general
maximus
-lrb-
russell
crowe
-rrb-
,
who
have
help
the
empire
conquer
nearly
everywhere
they
have
attempt
,
be
currently
-lrb-
in
the
year
180
a
.
d
.
that
be
-rrb-
wage
a
war
against
germanium
.
scott
shoot
the
gory
battle
in
a
awkward
style
,
similar
to
that
of
save
private
ryan
but
much
less
effective
.
it
be
blurry
,
in
slow
motion
,
and
the
sound
be
mute
.
as
soon
as
this
artistic
method
begin
,
it
be
hard
to
tell
what
be
what
and
who
be
who
.
it
be
a
good
thing
scott
stop
this
after
the
first
twenty
minute
or
else
gladiator
would
have
be
torture
to
watch
.
instead
,
the
general
swear
he
will
get
out
after
this
battle
.
he
want
to
go
back
to
he
family
and
he
crop
,
he
want
a
quiet
life
.
but
,
unexpectedly
,
he
get
anything
but
that
.
the
die
emperor
of
rome
,
marcus
aurelius
-lrb-
richard
harri
-rrb-
,
decide
to
have
maximus
appoint
new
emperor
of
rome
once
he
die
.
he
ask
maximus
to
restore
the
republic
by
give
more
power
to
the
senator
.
all
of
this
do
not
go
well
for
aurelius
'
son
,
commodus
-lrb-
joaquin
phoenix
-rrb-
who
be
expect
he
father
to
name
he
the
new
emperor
.
jealous
and
upset
,
commodus
kill
he
own
father
,
name
himself
emperor
,
kill
maximus
'
wife
and
son
,
and
attempt
to
kill
maximus
.
but
maximus
be
able
to
escape
he
own
death
and
vow
to
kill
commodus
and
fulfill
marcus
aurelius
'
wish
.
now
a
slave
,
the
only
way
he
can
win
he
own
freedom
and
complete
he
goal
be
to
become
a
win
gladiator
,
who
eventually
be
release
for
they
success
.
a
story
of
betrayal
and
promise
,
gladiator
be
more
than
just
a
mindless
action
flick
.
you
actually
care
about
the
character
,
sometimes
even
the
evil
villain
commodus
,
who
be
just
a
young
man
as
determine
to
make
rome
one
way
as
maximus
be
determine
to
make
it
the
other
way
.
phoenix
play
he
character
brilliantly
.
think
of
commodus
as
the
percy
wetmore
-lrb-
of
pant-wetter
the
green
mile
-rrb-
of
the
roman
empire
-
a
whiny
,
sleazy
,
''
respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man
''
brat
who
hate
when
he
be
not
the
center
of
attention
.
every
scene
we
see
commodus
,
he
be
either
cry
or
he
look
like
he
have
just
be
cry
.
phoenix
have
definitely
mature
as
a
actor
since
to
die
for
,
and
gladiator
show
he
be
more
than
just
river
's
little
brother
.
crowe
be
also
excellent
as
the
film
's
grisly-faced
hero
.
maximus
be
one
of
the
few
character
in
recent
cinema
who
actually
have
emotion
.
this
guy
actually
act
like
a
anyone
in
he
situation
would
act
,
he
be
no
invincible
superhero
who
only
blurt
out
one-liner
,
he
-lrb-
believe
it
or
not
-rrb-
act
like
a
human
be
!
the
rest
of
the
cast
,
include
richard
harri
,
djimon
hounsou
,
walter
hill
,
derek
jacobus
,
and
connie
nielsen
be
also
first
rate
.
ridley
scott
,
use
outstanding
special
effect
,
have
brilliantly
recreate
the
roman
coliseum
,
the
loudness
of
the
roman
mob
,
and
the
city
of
rome
in
general
.
the
visual
be
breathtaking
and
voluminous
,
like
a
cleopatra
of
the
year
2000
.
the
costuming
be
also
wonderful
from
the
detailed
shield
and
armor
to
the
exquisite
dress
of
the
upper-class
politician
.
gladiator
be
another
movie
you
have
to
see
on
the
big
screen
to
get
the
most
out
of
the
experience
.
along
with
u-571
,
action
fan
should
have
plenty
to
see
in
theater
this
week
and
should
expect
much
more
excitement
to
come
this
summer
of
2000
.
