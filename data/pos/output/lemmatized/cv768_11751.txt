in
life
.
despite
some
serious
character
problem
,
this
be
still
a
very
good
film
.
you
probably
know
about
the
plot
so

,
he

really
smarter
than

but
nobody
know
it
.
he
like
to
go
out
with
he
friend
chuckie
-lrb-
affleck
-rrb-
and
they
other
working-class
buddy
and
drink

good-looking
,
charismatic
,
and
witty
but
have
a
terrible
time
with
authority
and
stiff
college
folk
.

the
meantime
will
meet
a
british
medical
school
student
-lrb-
driver
-rrb-
and
they
begin
to
fall
in
love
.
the
story
start
out
well
enough
and
be
a
pretty
original
basis
for
a
film
.
even
though
we
?
ve
see
movie
about
misunderstand
,
erratic
prodigy
before
-lrb-
?
shine
?
ring
a
bell
?
-rrb-
,
the
script
here
create
a
complex
narrative
that
doesn
?
t
just
focus
solely
on
one
character
.
alas
though
,
this
be
not
a
perfect
film
,
as
much
as
you
feel
like
it
could
?
ve
be
while
watch
it
.
the
one
real
problem
i
have
with
it
be
the
unrealistic
nature
of
the
main
character
.
be
it
possible
for
a
lowly
janitor
to
be
this
intelligent
?
of
course
.
be
it
possible
for
he
to
be
estrange
from
any
deep
,
human
relationship
?
usually
,
yes
.
but
,
be
it
possible
for
he
to
also
be
so
handsome
,
funny
,
quick
with
the
tongue
,
and
city-street
tough
?
not
very
likely
.
come
on
,
usually
these
guy
be
total
nerd
who
can
?
t
even
buy
they
own
shirt
,
much
less
talk
down
a
harvard
student
in
a
hip
pub
while
pick
up
phone
number
from
pretty
med
.
-
school
girl
.
will
be
just
a
little
too
perfect
,
and
in
order
to
accept
the
character
you
disbelief
suspension
need
to
be
in
excellent
work
condition
.
the
heavy-handed
,
anti-war
statement
make
by
will
at
a
government
job
interview
late
in
the
film
be
also
boorish
,
overlong
,
pompous
,
and
completely
unnecessary
.
all
this
sound
pretty
bad
,
but
the
film
somehow
make
up
for
it
in
other
way
.
damon
?
s
act
overshadow
the
fact
that
the
character
be
slightly
unbelievable
,
he
performance
be
truly
extraordinary
.
which
lead
I
to
the
really
good
part
of
the
review
.
the
strength
of
this
movie
can
be
sum
up
in
one
single
word
:
act
.
i
can
?
t
recall
see
a
film
recently
that
be
so
well-acted
from
top
to
bottom
.
from
minnie
driver
?
s
frustrated
lover
to
ben
affleck
?
s
laid-back
best
friend
,
and
all
the
small
role
in
between
,
the
performance
be
magnificent
.
robin
william
?
skill
be
a
give
as
a
bereaved
psychologist
who
could
?
ve
have
a
legendary
career
but
be
knock
off
the
path
somewhere
down
the
line
.
the
real
gem
though
be
stellan
skarsg
?
rd
?
s
turn
as
professor
lambeau
,
a
award-winning
mathematician
who
feel
reduce
in
comparison
to
a
younger
,
smarter
will
hunting
.
the
scene
between
william
and
skarsg
?
rd
,
as
two
old
college
pal
who
?
ve
be
bring
back
together
by
this
enigmatic
kid
,
display
some
of
the
best
act
i
?
ve
ever
see
.
when
i
say
deliver
the
goods
,
this
be
what
i
?
m
talk
about
.
watch
these
two
work
be
what
go
to
see
movie
be
all
about
.
gus

as
well
as

good
will

.
despite
its
fault
,
it
be
still
a
intriguing
and
fascinating
film
and
you
be
not
likely
to
see
a
better
act
one
this
year
.
