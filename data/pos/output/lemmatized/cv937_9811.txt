review
:
the
title
of
this
movie
turn
I
off
at
first
.
i
mean
`
gi
jane
?
'
?
?
?
?
?
the
other
title
which
be
consider
be
more
promising
-
in
pursuit
of
honor
or
a
matter
of
honor
would
have
be
acceptable
although
navy
cross
or
undisclosed
be
a
little
meaningless
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
.
i
go
into
this
movie
not
like
the
title
and
be
one
of
those
people
who
think
that
demus
moore
be
absolutely
ghastly
as
a
actor
.
to
my
surprise
i
really
enjoy
the
movie
.
moore
as
lieutenant
jordan
o'neil
be
much
more
likeable
than
she
wash
out
excuse
for
a
gusty
woman
in
a
few
good
man
.
the
storyline
be
simple
.
anne
bancroft
play
senator
lillian
dehaven
be
a
ruthless
,
machiavellian
politician
with
a
agenda
to
push
.
use
feminism
to
achieve
political
mileage
,
she
force
the
military
power
that
be
to
backdown
and
permit
a
test
case
to
enter
the
highly
intensive
navy
s
.
e

l
.
training
.
jordan
be
select
due
to
the
fact
that
she
have
it
all
-
look
,
brain
and
strength
.
the
training
be
gruelle
and
the
indignity
almost
painful
to
watch
.
nonetheless
,
it
be
one
of
those
movie
that
make
I
want
to
cheer
out
and
encourage
the
hapless
hero\/heroine
along
in
his\/her
endeavor
.
sure
,
there
be
the
stereotypical
element
-
inhuman
treatment
,
sexual
innuendo
,
resentful
peer
,
pained
boyfriend
and
sexist
commanding
officer
.
step
away
from
the
stereotype
though
,
viggo
mortensen
as
master
chief
john
urgayle
try
to
get
away
from
be
nothing
more
than
a
brutal
screamer
.
he
character
exercise
a
little
more
intellectual
rigor
than
you
would
normally
expect
from
such
a
character
.
jordan
's
boyfriend
royce
be
also
in
the
military
.
although
they
both
start
at
the
same
time
,
due
to
the
fact
that
he
have
see
active
service
,
he
have
advance
through
the
rank
much
more
quickly
than
she
have
.
royce
-lrb-
what
be
he
surname
?
do
we
care
?
-rrb-
almost
resent
jordan
's
attempt
to
advance
herself
,
although
he
quickly
settle
down
to
be
doe-eyed
and
supportive
.
he
character
seem
to
have
be
throw
in
so
that
we
know
that
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
lesbian
to
want
to
be
in
the
military
.
in
part
,
this
be
a
very
silly
movie
,
with
gratuitous
line
and
scene
throw
in
for
effect
which
be
so
blatantly
obvious
or
contrived
that
it
be
hard
not
to
cringe
.
i
still
like
it
though
.
weakness
in
the
script
aside
,
this
be
a
film
which
capture
a
heroic
and
reckless
mood
.
as
we
watch
jordan
's
battle
,
it
be
increasingly
clear
that
it
be
a
personal
battle
.
this
be
a
individual
's
fight
for
self-advancement
.
we
do
not
have
to
have
we
tooth
set
on
edge
by
didactic
preaching
,
we
do
not
have
to
feel
uncomfortable
because
we
be
have
ideology
thrust
down
we
throat
.
it
be
enough
that
we
can
sit
back
and
hope
that
this
one
person
get
what
she
want
and
we
can
admire
she
tenacity
and
determination
without
come
out
and
say
whether
we
believe
woman
should
go
into
combat
or
not
.
