so
finger
be
pointed
at
sir

de
lodgerley
play
by
charle
hawtrey
,
who
have
a
rather
lecherous
character
to
play
this
time
.
the
cardinal

cromwell
decide
to
get
a
sign
confession
from
sir

sometimes
need

he
do
.
by
then
,
henry
have
find
himself
a
new
queen
,
play
by
none
other
than
barbara
windsor
!
it
look
like
he
have
some
explain
to
do
!
there
be
stand-out
performance
by
sid
jame
as
henry
,
joan
sim
as
marie
,
and
terry
scott
in
a
unusual
role
as
the
cardinal
.
also
there
be
cameo
from
kenneth
connor
and
peter
butterworth
,
who
play
barbara
's
father
.
the
set
and
costume
design
be
first
class
and
the
overall
production
of
this
film
be
good
.
there
be
even
a
early
appearance
from
david
prowse
,
who
later
become
the
green
cross
code
man
and
darth
vader
.
the
film
do
have
it
be
downside
though
,
as
it
be
get
pretty
routine
for
the
carry-on
team
to
stage
historical
film
and
the
inventive
streak
of
the
script
seem
to
run
out
pretty
quickly
.
there
be
also
the
absence
of
hattie
jacque
and
bernard
bresslaw
,
who
could
have
help
the
film
along
.
however
,
overall
the
film
be
funny
and
there
be
plenty
of
laugh
and
saucy
joke
,
so
that
be
why
i
mainly
recommend
it
to
carry
on
fan
only
,
but
there
be
enough
humor
in
the
film
to
make
it
worth
anyone
's
while
to
sit
down
and
watch
it
.
