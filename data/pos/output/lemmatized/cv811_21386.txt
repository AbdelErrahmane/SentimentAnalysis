single
mother

father
's
absence
.
the
city
of
harlem
play
a
strong
role
in
the
movie
.
roberta
's
mother
be
initially
reluctant
to
see
she
daughter
move
to
that
part
of
town
and
the
film
do
nothing
to
combat
that
stereotype
.
the
noise
track
for
these
scene
be
dominate
by
siren
;
predictably
one
of
roberta
's
student
be
gun
down
and
kill
off
screen
.
one
thing
the
film
do
lack
be
subtlety
.
the
fact
that
a
little
boy
be
play
''
we
shall
overcome
''
on
he
violin
after
the
aforementioned
shooting
be
a
cute
and
discreet
reference
.
the
fact
that
the
entire
orchestra
begin
to
play
it
over
and
over
soon
after
be
a
overdo
reference
that
show
how
little
credit
he
give
the
audience
.
-lrb-
of
course
,
in
horror
film
the
foreshadowing
and
between-the-line
moment
be
mean
to
be
overdo
,
so
perhaps
he
too
be
just
learn
to
play
the
game
.
-rrb-
even
with
all
its
flaw
,
music
of
the
heart
be
a
beautiful
film
.
that
be
not
a
excuse
for
the
movie
's
poor
beginning
.
but
as
i
watch
the
scene
in
carnegie
hall
,
i
thought
of
some
of
the
great
act
that
have
take
that
stage
.
in
December
of
1979
a
comedian
name
andy
kaufman
put
on
a
show
that
will
forever
be
remember
as
one
of
the
most
original
in
theater
history
.
the
performance
include
a
dead-on
elvi
impression
,
robin
william
in
disguise
and
a
moment
at
the
end
when
kaufman
announce
he
would
take
the
whole
audience
out
for
milk
and
cookie
.
so
,
how
do
this
comic
genius
choose
to
open
the
show
of
he
life
?
he
have
a
character
name
tony
clifton
take
the
stage
for
the
sole
purpose
of
irritating
and
anger
the
audience
.
perhaps
it
be
okay
for
music
of
the
heart
to
start
off
rusty
because
just
as
kaufman
have
santa
's
favorite
food
,
this
movie
have
a
amazing
finale
.
