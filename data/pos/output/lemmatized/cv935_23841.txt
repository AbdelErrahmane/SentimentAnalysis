when
i
initially
set
out
to
review
this
film
,
my
tag
line
be
go
to
be
''
you
too
can
believe
whale
can
fly
''
.
then
it
be
go
to
be
''
you
too
can
believe
pastel
triangle
can
fly
''
.
then
,
it
be
go
to
be
''
you
too
can
believe
wood
sprite
can
fly
''
.
finally
,
i
just
give
up
try
to
come
up
with
a
tag
line
and
decide
to
say
...
there
be
a
lot
of
fly
go
on
in
this
film
!
as
we
first
host
steve
martin
tell
we
,
the
original
concept
behind
fantasia
be
to
bring
it
out
every
year
with
some
old
segment
retain
and
some
new
segment
add
in
.
well
apparently
that
plan
fall
by
the
wayside
for
a
while
,
because
approximately
sixty
year
have
pass
since
the
original
classic
be
release
.
part
of
this
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
cold
reception
the
film
get
when
it
be
first
release
in
1940
-lrb-
gross
somewhere
close
to
$
110
,
000
in
its
original
month
of
release
-rrb-
.
subsequent
re-release
of
the
film
have
elevate
the
popularity
of
the
film
to
the
classic
status
it
have
finally
achieve
-lrb-
and
rightfully
deserve
-rrb-
.
to
celebrate
the
release
of
a
update
version
of

after
the

the

will
be

.
be
the
format
effective
for
the
film
?
with
a
few
exception
,
yes
.
the
first
segment
we
be
present
with
be
set
to
beethoven
's
fifth
symphony
.
it
be
hard
to
describe
exactly
what
this
segment
be
about
,
but
it
involve
a
bunch
of
brightly
color
butterfly
look
triangle
flit
about
happily
.
everything
seem
to
be
go
great
for
these
little
thing
until
the
ground
erupt
with
swarm
of
evil
,
black
bat-like
triangle
that
attack
and
engulf
they
lighter
counterpart
.
eventually
,
shaft
of
light
from
above
help
drive
away
the
evil
bat-like
thing
and
peace
return
to
the
butterfly
thing
.
though
this
segment
be
not
very
story
drive
,
some
of
the
image
be
very
visually
strong
,
especially
the
scene
in
which
the
dark
cloud
of
bat
thing
-lrb-
who
be
all
outline
in
blood
red
color
-rrb-
begin
to
overtake
the
sky
.
the
next
segment
be
set
to
ottorino
respighus
's
''
the
pine
of
rome
''
.
in
this
segment
,
some
humpback
whale

happily
through
the
ocean
and
eventually
emerge
from
the
water
and
fly
around
the
massive
iceberg
that
pepper
the
oceanscape
.
a
whale
calf
get
into
a
scuffle
with
some
nearby
bird
during
the
flight
and
end
up
get
trap
in
a
giant
iceberg
he
smash
into
while
try
to
avoid
the
bird
attack
.
he
be
finally

by
another
liberating
shaft
of
light
-rrb-
and
he
and
he
brethren
take
to
the
sky
and
fly
into
the
upper
atmosphere
where
they
frolic
in
the
''
ocean
''
of
cloud
.
again
,
visual
be
the
key
with
this
segment
,
especially
where
the
whale
be
involve
.
reportedly
the
whale
,
as
view
on
a
imax
screen
in
certain
sequence
,
be
show
as
actual
size
.
the
cgus
whale
look
incredibly
life-like
,
except
for
some
googly
cartoon
eye
draw
onto
the
image
.
one
especially
striking
image
involve
the
giant
shadow
of
one
of
the
whale
be
cast
through
the
wall
of
a
iceberg
as
the
whale
calf
try
to
find
a
way
out
to
its
parent
.
absolutely
beautiful
stuff
.
the
third
segment
-lrb-
and
the
least
of
the
eight
segment
-rrb-
be
set
to

this
segment
be
design

and
intertwine
four

,
a

sad

that
dream
of

and
a

he
overbearing
wife
.
i
will
not
go
into
how
everything
work
out
,
but
in
fine
disney
tradition
there
be
a
happy
ending
.
unfortunately
,
the
story
drag
quite
a
bit
and
the
seem
out
of
place
within
the
hyper
reality
of
the
rest
of
the

with
a
wind-up

,
much
to
the
dismay
of

jester
.
the
jester
knock
the
soldier
out
of

although
the
ending

story
,
''
the
steadfast
tin
soldier
''
be
decently
tell
with
in
the
framework
of
a
seven
minute
short
.
some
child
may
find
the
jester
to
be
a
little
frightening
,
but
otherwise
the
segment
be
well
make
.
segment
five
be
the
funniest
of
the
bunch
.
set
to

with
a
yo-yo
while
they
be
try
to
perform
a
choreographed
dance
number
.
while
it
be
the
shortest
clip
of
the
group
and
a
throwback
to
the
alligator
and
hippo
dancing
in
the
first
fantasia
,
it
be
still
well
accomplish
and
a
welcome
bit
of
comedy
.
segment
six
be
the
only
segment
to
be

people
remember
most

the
draw

slapstick
style
of
comedy
in
this
piece

here
,
and
well
worth
the
ten
dollar
a
ticket
alone
-lrb-
although
brush
stroke
be
evident
in

scene
due

the
host

,
although
steve

's
clip
be
pretty
funny
.
be
sure
to
stay
through
the
credit
for
a
little
more
humor
from
martin
.
penn
and
teller
be
usually
funny
,
but
here
they
gag
seem
routine
and
therefore
uninteresting
.
the
best
segment
come
from
,
of
all
people
,
bette
midler
,
who
get
to
tell
we
about
some
of
the
abandon
segment
that
never
make
it
off

be
a
perfect
way
to
spend
the
afternoon
.
the
film
be
also
decent
family
entertainment
and
contain
little
to
no
objectionable
material
.
as
i
mention
earlier
in
the
review
,
if
ten
dollar
seem
like
too
much
for
you
to
spend
on
this
film
,
fear
not
because
after
its
run
in
imax
theater
it
be
go
to
be
bring
out
in
regular
theater
.
i
must
stress
that
the
best
way
to
see
this
film
be
on
a
imax
screen
though
.
then
you
too
can
believe
that
