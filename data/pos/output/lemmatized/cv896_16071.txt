since
i
be
unfamiliar
of
whale
prior
to
view
the
film
,
there
be
no
way
to
know
how
accurate
the
film
be
,
but
i
suspect
that
much
of
it
only
come
from
whale
's
inner
fantasy
and
hallucination
.

as
the

jame
whale
,
we
learn
quickly
be
,
what
many
people
refer
to
he
as
in
the
film
,
''
a
dirty
old
man
.
''
in
one
of
the
opening
scene
,
a
young
film
enthusiast
visit
whale
's
home
to
interview
he
and
whale
agree
,
on
one
condition
:
for
every
question
he
answer
,
the
young
man
must
take
off
a
article
of
clothing
.
because
of
this
episode
,
we
know
exactly
what
it
be
whale
want
when
he
ask
clayton
to
pose
for
he
for
a
painting
,
later
make
the
excuse
that
he
bright
,
white
shirt
be
disract
only
so
he
will
take
it
off
.
clayon
agree
,
and
do
not
really
think
much
of
this
,
much
to
the
warning
of
he
friend
,
become
more
and
more
intrigue
in
the
story
whale
tell
he
about
he
past
.
certainly
,
the
relationship
between
whale
and
boone
be
head
for
a
downfall
,
since
whale
start
to
grow
a
deep
love
for
this
young
man
,
even
though
boone
be
not
gay
,
and
whale
himself
realize
he
be
near
the
conclusion
to
he
life
,
as
he
begin
to
seldom
suffer
mild
stroke
and
moment
of
true
catharsis
.
''
god
and
monster
''
be
a
intimate
and
seemingly
respectful
portrait
of
a
director
who
be
force
to
become
somewhat
of
a
outcast
,
due
to
he
sexual
preference
,
and
never
get
the
recognition
he
would
have
like
,
since
he
long
to
be
refer
to
as
a
''
motion
picture
director
,
''
rather
than
a
''
horror
director
.
''
and
in
one
heartbreaking
scene
,
he
attend
a
party
with
boone
be
he
guest
,
hold
by
director
george
cuckor
,
and
find
that
many
of
the
other
attendee
do
not
recognize
he
anymore
.
it
be
evident
that
whale
's
first
love
in
he
life
be
make
movie
,
and
when
he
career
ultimately
fall
apart
,
so
do
he
passion
in
life
.
as
play
brilliantly
by
ian
mckellen
,
jame
whale
come
off
as
a
sad
,
but
dignified
man
,
and
a
person
who
be
not
afraid
to
stand
out
from
other
,
just
as
long
as
he
know
he
be
be
true
to
himself
.
he
never
hide
the
fact
that
he
be
gay
,
however
,
even
if
it
mean
threaten
he
filmmaking
profession
,
and
it
be
this
unblinking
honesty
that
make
he
a
great
person
.
through
the
complicated
relationship
that
develop
between
whale
and
boone
,
boone
,
of
course
,
only
thing
of
whale
as
a
possible
friend
or
someone
he
can
talk
to
,
while
it
mean
so
much
more
to
whale
,
who
see
boone
as
sort
of
he
salvation
in
life
.
although
boone
be
only
in
a
dead-end
job
as
a
gardener
of
people
's
home
,
whale
view
he
as
the
ideal
man
,
not
only
one
that
be
good-looking
,
even
though
it
be
this
attraction
that
first
begin
he
feeling
,
but
one
that
will
actually
listen
to
he
.
since
whale
live
with
only
he
loyal
,
but
disapprove
maid
-lrb-
touchingly
portray
by
lynn
redgrave
-rrb-
,
it
be
boone
that
whale
can
talk
to
in
he
ultimate
reclusion
from
the
world
,
and
the
only
reason
whale
finally
decide
to
attend
the
gathering
of
george
cuckor
.
although
a
extremely
fine
and
mature
picture
,
a
few
small
element
hold
the
film
back
from
ultimate
greatness
.
it
be
appreciate
that
the
film
do
not
pull
for
any
obvious
or
overly
dramatic
story
development
,
but
it
be
a
little
thin
,
and
the
structuring
of
the
''
on-again-off-again
''
friendship
at
the
film
's
center
be
fairly
predictable
.
we
know
early
on
where
these
two
character
be
head
,
and
we
can
guess
that
there
will
be
a
final
confrontation
between
the
two
as
the
tension
slowly
build
.
in
lesser
hand
,
this
set-up
might
have
feel
too
calculate
,
but
it
be
not
in
the
surprisingly
deft
treatment
and
write
that
help
the
film
to
be
much
more
than
this
.
also
,
a
subplot
be
briefly
bring
up
between
clayton
and
a
waitress
work
at
a
bar
-lrb-
effectively
play
by
lolita
davidovich
-rrb-
,
but
abruptly
drop
and
never
bring
up
again
.
if
the
film
be
not
go
to
follow
up
on
this
side
story
,
then
it
,
perhaps
,
should
have
be
take
out
altogether
.
''
god
and
monster
''
be
a
heartfelt
and
intelligent
motion
picture
,
impressively
direct
by
bill
condon
,
who
,
i
sense
,
relate
to
or
fully
understand
the
meaning
behind
the
curious
relationship
between
whale
and
boone
.
the
film
also
play
as
a
tribute
to
a
fine
man
who
meet
a
untimely
end
.
walk
away
from
''
god
and
monster
,
''
it
be
ian
mckellen
's
marvelous
and
astounding
performance
that
leave
the
most
impression
on
I
,
and
i
doubt
there
could
have
be
anyone
who
could
have
step
into
the
role
more
fully
and
believably
.
it
be
a
sad
testament
when
a
person
's
true
talent
and
love
be
unfairly
take
away
from
they
,
base
on
the
scrutinization
and
judgement
of
they
personal
life
,
which
,
ironically
enough
,
be
no
one
else
's
business
in
the
first
place
.
