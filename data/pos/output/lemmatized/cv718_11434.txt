usually
a
movie
be
about
something
more
than
a
soil
rug
,
but
not
the
big
lebowskus
.
the
new
offering
from
the
creator
of
1996
's
critical
hit
fargo
,
be
to
say
the
least
,
wildly
entertaining
.
originality
have
always
be
a
strong
trait
in
the
coen
brother
's
movie
,
and
the
big
lebowskus
be
insanely
original
.
it
begin
oddly
enough
when
jeff
''
the
dude
''
lebowskus
-lrb-
jeff
bridge
-rrb-
be
mistake
for
a
millionaire
,
jeff
''
the
big
''
lebowskus
-lrb-
david
huddleston
-rrb-
,
who
be
wife
,
bunny
-lrb-
tara
reid
-rrb-
owe
money
all
over
town
.
two
goon
,
out
to
collect
on
bunny
's
debt
break
into
dude
's
house
.
they
attempt
to
collect
the
money
that
bunny
owe
they
and
one
of
they
urinate
on
he
rug
.
the
next
day
dude
explain
he
situation
to
he
bowling
team
-lrb-
steve
buscemus
&
john
goodman
,
respectively
.
-rrb-
he
be
advise
to
go
to
the
big
lebowskus
and
get
he
to
pay
for
the
defile
rug
.
he
do
this
,
and
shortly
after
get
tie
up
in
a
kidnapping
caper
.
this
be
a
extremely
funny
movie
with
lot
of
belly
laugh
moment
.
the
coen
brother
have
assemble
a
great
cast
that
play
off
each
other
perfectly
.
also
several
great
support
role
,
john
turturro
as
a
child
molest
bowler
name
jesus
.
the
coen
's
script
play
off
perfectly
and
it
all
go
together
to
make
it
extremely
entertaining
.
i
doubt
this
movie
will
be
nearly
as
popular
as
fargo
,
but
its
off
the
wall
moment
make
it
so
far
the
best
of
1998
.
if
you
like
anything
else
the
coen
brother
have
do
you
will
love
this
one
,
if
not
they
give
this
one
a
try
its
a
little
different
.
