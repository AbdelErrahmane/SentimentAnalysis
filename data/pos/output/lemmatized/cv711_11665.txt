.
he
have
lose

.
he
have
already
lose
he
wife
,
and
he
bury
he
grief
in
a
affair
with
a
married
woman
.
he
do
not
want
to
talk
about
the
accident
,
and
he
see
the
lawsuit
as
nothing
more
than
the
unnecessary
opening
of
old
wound
.
to
he
,
the
town
should
be
able
to
take
care
of
its
own
pain
,
and
it
do
not
need
outsider
like
stephen
get
in
the
way
.
central
to
''
the
sweet
hereafter
''
be
the
tale
of
nicole
burnell
-lrb-
sarah
polley
-rrb-
,
a
teenage
girl
who
dream
of
be
a
singer
before
the
accident
turn
she
into
''
a
wheelchair
girl
,
''
as
she
put
it
.
aside
from
stephen
,
nicole
be
the
most
complex
character
in
the
film
,
and
it
be
she
who
ultimately
decide
the
fate
of
the
town
and
how
the
lawsuit
will
turn
out
.
it
be
also
she
sad
,
haunted
voice
that
we
often
hear
on
the
soundtrack
,
read
robert
browning
's
poem
about
the
pied
piper
,
and
how
when
he
lead
all
the
town
's
child
away
,
one
be
leave
behind
because
he
be
cripple
.
obviously
,
nicole
be
that
child
,
and
she
feel
somehow
betray
that
the
rest
of
the
town
's
child
leave
she
alone
by
die
in
the
wreck
.
she
situation
be
further
complicated
because
she
be
involve
in
a
loving
,
but
incestuous
relationship
with
she
father
-lrb-
tom
mccamus
-rrb-
.
there
be
only
one
,
fleeting
scene
that
suggest
this
relationship
,
but
it
be
somehow
tie
into
the
final
act
of
the
film
.
of
all
the
storyline
in
''
the
sweet
hereafter
,
''
this
be
the
most
complicated
and
unresolved
,
although
its
implication
stretch
throughout
the
entirety
of
the
film
.
egoyan
know
that
the
kind
of
question
he
bring
up
have
no
simple
answer
--
if
any
at
all
--
and
he
do
not
condescend
to
the
audience
by
try
to
neatly
wrap
it
up
.
what
egoyan
have
do
in
''
the
sweet
hereafter
''
be
really
nothing
short
of
miraculous
.
in
he
adaptation
of
the
novel
by
russell
bank
,
he
have
make
a
deeply
move
film
about
a
lawyer
by
transcend
the
pettiness
of
law
and
drive
headlong
into
the
deeper
meaning
of
what
be
loss
,
and
how
pitiful
monetary
and
material
possession
be
when
compare
to
human
life
.
egoyan
have
always
be
a
talented
,
but
distant
and
cerebral
filmmaker
whose
work
suffer
only
in
that
it
feel
so
cold
.
''
the
sweet
hereafter
''
be
quite
the
opposite
;
egoyan
's
stylistic
and
narrative
structure
work
brilliantly
to
heighten
the
impact
of
the
natural
emotion
,
and
draw
the
audience
into
the
tragedy
.
''
the
sweet
hereafter
''
seem
to
contain
the
combined
emotional
impact
that
all
he
other
film
lack
.
the
film
be
fill
with
beautiful
,
subtle
performance
from
all
the
actor
,
especially
ian
holm
as
the
lawyer
and
sarah
polley
as
the
sad
child
who
be
leave
behind
.
the
beautiful
,
roving
camerawork
by
paul
sarossy
and
the
haunting
,
melodic
musical
score
by
mychael
danna
-lrb-
both
previous
egoyan
collaborator
-rrb-
give
the
film
a
visual
and
aural
cohesiveness
with
the
thematic
element
.
like
he
earlier
film
,
egoyan
weave
together
multiple
storyline
that
form
a
blanket
whole
.
he
work
with
time
as
a
fluid
substance
,
shift
back
and
forth
between
the
past
,
the
distant
past
,
and
the
present
with
effortless
ease
.
the
actual
bus
wreck
itself
do
not
happen
until
midway
through
the
film
,
but
by
that
time
the
event
have
build
up
so
much
emotion
that
egoyan
can
film
it
from
a
distance
with
no
graphic
detail
,
and
still
have
it
carry
great
,
devastating
weight
.
because
human
life
have
become
such
a
cheap
commodity
in
movie
,
it
be
astounding
that
egoyan
can
convey
so
much
heartbreak
in
such
simple
,
direct
term
.
certainly
one
of
the
best
film
of
1997
,
''
the
sweet
hereafter
''
be
a
deeply
rewarding
,
mystifying
,
and
ultimately
human
film
.
