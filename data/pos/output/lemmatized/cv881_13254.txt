the
word
`
rest
'
in
the
title
should
be
stressed
since
this
be
a
movie
that
lack
any
action
scene
at
all
.
what
do
take
place
be
more
base
on
character
development
.
the
film
start
right
in
the
middle
of
the
life
of
four
people
:
nick
,
beth
,
carol
and
sid
.
what
they
have
do
earlier
be
for
the
most
part
only
hint
at
.
nick
and
beth
have
a
relationship
and
have
decide
to
move
from
enfield
,
arizona
to
butte
,
montana
.
-lrb-
and
i
who
think
that
butte
be
pronounced
slightly
different
...
-rrb-
carol
be
nick
's
ex-girlfriend
and
beth
's
best
friend
,
sid
be
a
joint-smoking
painter
that
come
to
repaint
they
house
before
the
new
tenant
move
in
.
obviously
base
on
a
stage
play
,
the
problem
with
the
movie
be
that
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
leave
out
.
it
be
not
obvious
that
nick
and
beth
be
in
love
with
each
other
,
the
reason
why
nick
be
fire
from
he
job
be
not
mention
.
and
why
nick
suddenly
decide
to
go
visit
he
parent
remain
a
mystery
,
when
he
have
not
see
they
for
many
year
.
set
in
a
small
-lrb-
fictional
?
-rrb-
town
in
arizona
be
a
good
move
,
since
this
make
the
film
focus
on
the
four
character
and
not
on
they
surroundings
.
the
name
of
the
city
be
not
important
,
this
could
take
place
anywhere
with
four
young
people
in
a
house
discuss
life
and
the
future
.
particularly
impressive
be
bridget
fonda
as
beth
who
end
up
in
bed
with
sid
when
she
fiance
nick
leave
she
.
not
a
actress
that
i
have
find
interesting
earlier
or
see
many
picture
with
,
but
i
'll
keep
a
eye
on
she
in
the
future
.
interesting
trivia
:
this
be
rate
r
in
the
we
but
rate
`
barntill
?
ten
'
in
sweden
wich
mean
that
anyone
at
any
age
can
see
it
.
