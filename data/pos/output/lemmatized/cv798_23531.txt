.
the
defense
claim
that
it
can
not
be
a
charge
of
murder
without
a
corpse
.
the
trial
prove
to
be
interesting
,
as
the
citizen
in
this
close-knit
,
respectable
community
,
lie
under
oath
,
provide
alibi
for
each
other
to
prove
they
could
not
have
be
at
the
jail
.
the

also
lie
,
say
he
can
not
identify

.
but
proof
come
by
way
of
a
newsreel
cameraman

.
as
for
proof
of
the
corpse
,
a
anonymous
letter
be
address
to
the

enclose
with
the
wedding
ring
katherine
give
joe
.
in
the
note
,
memento
be
misspell
,
which
make
katherine
realize
that

.
when
the
sentence
be
announce
,
20
of
the

be
find
guilty

murder
,
but
joe
march
into
the
courtroom
and
give
a
pious
speech
about
what
happen
.
katherine
forgive
he
,
and
this
very
strong
film
end
on
a
weaker
note
than
i
think
it
should
have
.
but
do
not
blame
lang
for
all
the
change
in
the
film
,
of
try
to
take
the
town
off
the
hook
by
introduce
this
wild
revenge
motive
.
mgm
could
not
bear
to
have
it
make
the
way
lang
want
it
,
that
be
,
by
have
tracy
die
in
the
lynching
.
instead
they
want
to
stop
short
of
condemn
so
many
small
american
town
where
lynching
actually
do
occur
,
and
they
thereby
meddle
throughout
the
entire
script
.
to
lang
's
credit
,
even
if
this
film
fail
to
be
a
masterpiece
because
of
the
interference
,
it
still
do
not
let
the
good
citizen
off
the
moral
hook
.
he
portrayal
of
the
attempt
lynching
be
powerfully
do
and
be
not
compromise
.
you
could
not
help
get
the
feeling
that
the
citizen
do
not
care
that
much
that
they
almost
lynch
a
innocent
man
,
but
care
more
about
protect
the
reputation
of
they
town
and
would
do
anything
to
keep
they
22
vigilante
from
go
to
jail
,
even
perjure
themselves
.
they
reaction
to
see
joe
alive
be
satisfy
only
in
that
it
mean
they
be
not
go
to
be
convict
.
lang
by
no
means
imply
that
the
town
have
learn
its
lesson
from
this
incident
.
he
do
imply
that
a
dark
side
to
joe
wilson
have
be
expose
,
and
the
innocent
,
jovial
good-guy
,
see
in
the
beginning
of
the
film
,
have
be
largely
altered
forever
by
this
traumatic
experience
.
