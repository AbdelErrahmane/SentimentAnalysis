but
i
suppose
the
most
satisfying
aspect
of
`

be
the
murder
scene
.
creative
,
resourceful

breathlessly
inventive
,
the
death
sequence
involve

what
will
trigger

will
it

the
murder
be
startling
and
largely
unforeseen
,
include
one
surprise
incident
that
make
the
audience
jump
out
of
they
seat
and
giggle
nervously
for
roughly
a
minute
afterward

a
sense
of
giddy
unpredictability
be
add
with
this
inventive
approach
.
it
get
sorta
tasteless
and
cheap
sometimes
,
but
who
care
?
it
be
fun
.
in
that
simple
regard
,
`
final

'
be
my
cup
of
tea
.
this
stylishly
execute
thriller
,
although
tag
with
laughable
circumstance
and
the
occasional
snippet
of
lame
dialogue
,
be
a
immensely
entertaining
jaunt
to
the
dark
side

after
the
show
,
it
will
also
have
a
frightening
impact
on
you

when
will

the
