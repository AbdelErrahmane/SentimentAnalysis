by

they

the
fact
that

further
illustrate
that
freudian
foundation
of
entitlement
which
all

,
no

a
traditional
expectation

she
can
not
go
higher
than

he
will
not
allow

and
what
be
amazing
about

''
be
that
every
word
of
that
criticism
be
draw
from
a
rather
opaque
metaphor

early
in
the
film
we
learn
that
tracy
be
romantically
,
and
then
sexually
,

with
a

it
be
like
payne
and
taylor
,
he
co-screenwriter
,
have
take
tracy
,
a
girl
desperate
for
friendship
,
loyalty
,
and
almost
perversely
draw
the
mythological
pattern
of
kid
who
be
so
utterly
reject
by
they
peer
,
that
they
find
sit
at
the
teacher
'
lunch
table
more
fitting
,
to
a
unlikely
extreme
with
she
as
the
protagonist
.
and
it
be
amazing
the
compassion
that
we
have
;
it
seem
so
real
to
we
,
and
not
merely
because
it
be

over

but
,
because
of
the
all
around
''

persona
of
these

,
we
easily
dismiss
the
truly
wayward

of
the

payne
