a
indian
runner
be
more
than
a
courier
.
he
\*
become
\*
the
message
he
be
carry
.
what
danger
be
a
bear
,
to
a
message
?
i
use
to
think
sean
penn
be
a
immature
,
arrogant
,
photographer
-
punching
,
madonna-marrying
,
loudmouth
.
but
all
that
have
change
now
.
the
guy
have
grow
up
.
and
that
be
not
all
.
it
seem
that
sean
penn
have
talent
both
as
a
writer
and
a
director
,
if
this
film
be
any
indication
.
one
might
imagine
a
movie
with
plenty
of
ruthless
rage
and
showy
machismo
,
give
penn
in
charge
of
bronson
and
and
hopper
.
but
,
no
.
this
film
be
about
a
real
struggle
,
and
the
victory
and
defeat
be
not
simple
.
penn
let
the
story
unfold
at
a
pace
dictate
by
the
life
of
the
character
,
without
unnecessary
rush
or
flash
.
the
focus
of
the
story
be
two
brother
.
david
morse
be
the
brother
who
have
grow
up
in
the
small
midwestern
town
in
which
they
be
raise
,
tend
a
fail
farm
and
finally
become
a
police
officer
.
viggo
mortensen
be
the
wild
brother
,
whose
wild
behavior
seem
to
be
a
reaction
to
some
ancient
pain
that
he
can
not
name
,
much
less
resolve
.
the
film
pick
the
story
up
on
the
day
when
mortensen
return
from
vietnam
,
and
morse
coincidentally
encounter
a
armed
youth
flee
for
the
state
line
.
it
become
clear
that
some
kind
of
conflict
threaten
the
link
that
the
brother
once
share
.
the
film
be
unobtrusive
,
simple
,
direct
,
plain
,
and
sincere
.
it
be
not
exactly
perfect
,
but
its
sincerity
be
well
invest
in
the
struggle
of
the
two
brother
to
identify
the
sickness
before
it
destroy
they
.
life
seem
to
move
forward
a
little
faster
than
they
can
get
a
handle
on
they
problem
.
this
be
a
good
film
without
big
budget
set
,
or
big
name
star
push
into
you
face
.
in
fact
,
i
be
review
it
because
i
suspect
that
it
may
not
get
much
marketing
.
there
be
perhaps
10
other
at
the
show
i
saw
.
i
think
the
structure
be
clean
and
not
oversimplify
,
though
there
be
a
few
free-form
section
which
also
work
very
well
.
the
obligatory
1960s
music
seem
a
little
cliche
,
but
what
be
you
go
to
do
--
this
movie
\*
do
\*
take
place
in
the
1960
after
all
.
in
my
opinion
,
it
be
worth
full-price
admission
.
