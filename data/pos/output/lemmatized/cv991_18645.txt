i
do
not
box
with
kid
glove
.
i
do
not
play
nice
,
i
be
not
a
nice
guy
,
and
i
never
,
ever
,
go
easy
on
a
film
.
i
consider
it
to
be
a
breech
of
some
sort
of
code
of
ethic
for
a
movie
critic
.
however
,
i
do
some
favor
,
and
these
often
come
in
the
form
of
point
that
i
hand
to
certain
group
due
to
the
artistic
bravery
.
rigormorti
,
the
production
company
that
have
be
my
prime
example
of
how
money
do
not
need
to
motivate
filmmaking
,
get
several
of
these
point
each
time
.
i
still
,
however
,
will
not
go
easy
on
they
.
they
recently
send
I
a
vh
copy
of
they
down
with
america
trilogy
-lrb-
which
begin
,
quite
wittily
,
with
a
disclaimer
that
they
be
not
try
to
undermine
america
with
the
making
of
this
film
.
-rrb-
and
i
decide
to
spend
a
hour
of
my
day
watch
it
.
in
the
famous
line
of
many
martyr
,
i
have
no
regret
.
well
,
i
do
have
some
regret
,
but
that
be
not
the
point
in
the
previous
sentence
.
the
point
of
it
be
that
down
with
america
be
a
film
that
,
from
a
critical
standpoint
,
do
not
entirely
disappoint
I
.
sure
,
the
risky
use
of
vh
instead
of
super
8mm
or
16mm
be
a
pain
,
and
the
natural
light
be
one
of
the
most
annoying
thing
about
public
access
film
,
but
the
movie
itself
be
fairly
enjoyable
.
down
with
america
concern
a
government
agent
,
needless
murder
,
and
a
book
contain
everything
from
the
unabomber
's
manifesto
to
the
1995
apple
computer
profit
report
.
like
the
previous
film
of
rigormorti
that
i
have
review
,
it
display
a
off-kilter
humor
and
intelligence
?
it
succeed
in
make
I
laugh
where
countless
studio
film
fail
.
the
best
way
to
see
this
film
would
be
as
a
parody
of
the
countless
conspiracy
film
that
we
have
be
drown
in
since
the
paranoia
of
the
80s
.
a
die
movement
from
the
day
they
start
,
these
paranoid
`
thriller
'
have
the
government
always
cover
up
something
and
have
the
same
favorite
word
:
`
roswell
.
'
in
down
with
america
,
the
line
`
roswell
'
be
highly
absent
.
with
a
about
ten
minute
run
time
,
down
with
america
effortlessly
sidestep
every
clich
?
that
the
conspiracy
film
fall
into
,
make
joke
at
they
at
the
same
time
,
and
provide
we
with
funny
and
memorable
character
.
again
,
i
have
see
movie
that
have
go
on
two
hour
with
character
i
could
not
care
less
about
.
the
film
,
as
previously
state
,
concern
a
federal
agent
-lrb-
peter
roach
-rrb-
,
a
obsess
librarian
-lrb-
merus
steven
-rrb-
,
a
mystery
man
-lrb-
joe
kaczkowskus
-rrb-
,
and
two
people
obsess
with
silence
in
the
library
-lrb-
robb
sherman
,
kevin
flower
-rrb-
.
the
plot
:
a
book
contain
the
secret
of
all
anarchist
be
hide
in
?
a
public
library
where
it
can
be
view
by
all
.
from
there
we
go
into
a
delightful
parody
.
the
federal
agent
claim
he
sovereign
right
to
alter
the
truth
,
the
librarian
go
on
a
diatribe
about
the
sanctity
of
book
.
we
spend
we
time
laugh
at
fairly
idiotic
joke
that
be
perform
much
too
well
consider
the
lack
of
coaching
of
the
cast
.
although
the
actor
and
actress
be
in
small
role
and
give
a
whole
new
meaning
to
`
no-name
'
,
it
end
up
be
the
no-name
people
who
do
a
good
job
,
deliver
better
performance
as
comic
villain
than
half
the
crap
that
hollywood
turn
out
.
for
once
,
i
do
not
have
a
url
that
i
know
offhand
to
give
you
as
to
where
to
locate
the
film
online
.
i
can
only
say
that
you
should
find
my
previous
review
of
l'auto
and
les
x-files
and
look
up
the
rigormorti
production
site
in
and
of
itself
.
it
be
almost
as
much
fun
as
the
film
.
