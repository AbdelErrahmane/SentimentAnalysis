be
be
call
a
cross
between
''
invasion

body

''
and
''
the
breakfast
club
,
''
and
i
do
not
think
i
could
describe
it
any
better
than
that
.
the
film
set
up
the
six
central
teenage
character
who
do
not
seem
to
have
much
in
common
,
and
then
the
science-fiction
aspect
be
add
,
involve
the
fear
that
the
faculty
at
herrington
high
school
be
actually
alien
who
be
quickly
transform
everyone
in
the
town
.
the
six
character
,
as
in
''
the
breakfast
club
,
''
can
be
easily
label
as
a
stereotype
,
but
as
they
be
develop
,
they
become
far
more
complex
:
casey
-lrb-
elijah
wood
-rrb-
,
the
much
pick
upon
nerd
;
stokely
-lrb-
clea
duvall
-rrb-
,
a
goth
outcast
who
hide
behind
the
false
facade
of
be
a
lesbian
so
everyone
will
avoid
she
;
zeke
-lrb-
josh
hartnett
-rrb-
,
a
drug
dealer
who
turn
out
to
be
a
science
whiz
;
stan
-lrb-
shawn
hatosy
-rrb-
,
the
star
football
quarterback
who
be
consider
quit
the
team
to
concentrate
more
on
academic
;
delilah
-lrb-
jordanna
brewster
-rrb-
,
the
popular
cheerleader
and
newspaper
journalist
;
and
marybeth
-lrb-
laura
harri
-rrb-
,
the
sweet
'n
southern
new
girl
in
town
.
although
the
character
be
only
slightly
connected
-lrb-
i
.
e
.
casey
be
delilah
's
photojournalist
assistant
;
marybeth
try
to
become
buddy
with
stokely
,
since
they
both
do
not
have
friend
,
etc
.
-rrb-
,
when
they
all
begin
to
suspect
the
teacher
due
to
some
grotesque
and
strange
occurrence
,
the
only
people
they
can
count
on
for
help
be
each
other
,
even
though
they
be
not
really
even
sure
if
they
can
trust
one
another
.
''
the
faculty
''
be
another
smart
and
pop-culturally
hip
film
from
williamson
,
although
it
do
not
equal
up
to
he
best
film
,
the
original
''
scream
,
''
and
rodriguez
,
whose
''
from
dusk
till
dawn
''
be
still
one
of
the
more
original
genre
film
of
the
90
's
.
williamson
and
rodriguez
be
so
assure
at
they
profession
,
respectively
,
that
the
idea
of
team
up
together
be
pretty
much
a
no-brainer
.
the
plotline
of
''
the
faculty
,
''
involve
alien
take
over
other
people
's
body
,
have
be
do
quite
a
lot
before
,
from
''
invasion
of
the
body
snatcher
,
''
to
''
the
puppet
master
,
''
to
''
invader
from
mar
,
''
so
one
of
the
obstacle
that
williamson
and
rodriguez
have
to
overcome
be
to
somehow
make
the
idea
seem
fresh
,
and
by
set
the
goings-on
at
a
high
school
and
have
the
protagonist
be
a
group
of
teens
,
they
be
mostly
successful
.
surely
,
the
convention
of
the
story
be
still
the
same
,
and
the
climax
be
inevitable
,
but
there
be
a
few
surprise
along
the
way
,
include
the
question
of
who
be
the
alien
,
and
who
be
not
.
the
epilogue
be
also
a
refreshing
change-of-pace
as
it
do
not
set
up
a
sequel
but
end
on
a
note
that
probably
could
not
have
be
any
better
.
the
performance
in
''
the
faculty
''
be
a
treat
throughout
,
since
there
be
so
many
recognizable
actor
in
role
that
be
the
polar
opposite
of
what
they
usually
do
.
one
exception
be
the
teens
,
who
,
aside
from
elijah
wood
,
be
not
very
well-known
,
but
they
all
aquit
themselves
nicely
,
particularly
wood
-lrb-
the
seasoned
pro
-rrb-
,
clea
duvall
,
and
jordanna
brewster
.
as
member
of
the
faculty
,
robert
patrick
-lrb-
''
t2
:
judgement
day
''
-rrb-
be
creepy
as
the
gym
coach
;
piper
laurie
be
amusing
and
threatening
as
the
drama
teacher
;
bebe
neuwirth
actually
be
somehow
able
to
look
like
a
alien
;
and
salma
hayek
,
as
the
school
nurse
with
a
bad
case
of
the
cold
,
be
very
funny
in
a
small
role
.
the
standout
,
in
my
opinion
,
of
the
whole
cast
be
famke
janssen
who
turn
in
a
oddly
touching
performance
as
the
shy
and
meek
english
teacher
who
,
after
turn
into
a
alien
,
become
the
sex
bombshell
.
if
there
be
any
problem
i
have
with
the
faculty
,
it
be
that
some
of
they
be
give
no
real
payoff
in
the
climactic
sequence
.
since
the
teenager
realize
that
in
order
to
save
everyone
they
must
kill
the
''
queen
''
alien
,
many
of
the
faculty
member
disappear
.
it
might
have
be
more
fun
if
they
have
to
face
every
one
of
the
teacher
,
although
the
finale
be
still
pretty
impressive
,
and
include
some
showstopping
creature
effect
,
especially
for
a
relatively
low
15-million-dollar
budget
.
although
not
one
of
the
best
horror
or
science-fiction
film
i
have
see
,
''
the
faculty
''
be
still
a
exciting
and
worthy
film
that
dimension
film
be
smart
to
release
around
the
holiday
season
when
this
type
of
genre
offering
be
usually
not
release
.
while
the
story
be
as
old
as
the
hill
,
it
be
also
,
in
a
way
,
timeless
,
because
everyone
,
i
think
,
have
suspect
at
one
time
or
another
that
a
certain
person
simply
do
not
act
right
,
as
if
they
really
be
not
human
.
and
by
put
this
idea
in
the
setting
of
a
small-town
high
school
,
it
perfectly
contrast
with
the
alienation
that
most
teenager
usually
go
through
when
relate
to
adult
and
other
peer
.
+
note
:
the
ad
and
poster
campaign
for
this
film
be
hugely
misleading
,
as
it
feature
r
&
b
artist
usher
raymond
as
one
of
the
main
character
.
in
actuality
,
he
only
have
a
small
role
as
one
of
stan
's
buddy
who
become
quarterback
after
stan
resign
from
the
team
.
if
i
be
one
of
the
head
from
dimension
,
i
would
change
this
advertising
at
once
,
since
it
be
unnecessary
and
rather
deceive
.
