director
bille
August
manage
to
create
a
faithful
adaptation
of
victor
hugo
's
novel
,
which
,
though
omit
some
of
the
political
undertone
,
remain
true
to
the
overall
story
and
tone
of
the
book
.
hopefully
you
will
not
,
as
some
clueless
member
of
the
audience
do
,
wonder
where
all
the
song
go
.
the
movie
manage
to
be
completely
engross
without
the
andrew
lloyd
webber
flourish
.
the
experience

bolster

strong
performance

neeson
and
rush
deservedly
take
center
stage
with
they
core
role

neeson
in
particular
deserve
kudos
for
he
portrayal
of
a
man
try
to
do
good
,
but
continually
haunt
by
he
past
.
the
support
cast
be
also
extraordinary
.
the
only
actor
who
dim
in
comparison
be
han
matheson
,
play
the
revolutionary
,
marius
.
the
film
slightly
lose
its
luster
during
he
brief
love
affair
,
but
it
be
transitory
,
and
truly
only
distract
when
contrast
with
the
rest
of
the
film
.
the
novel
les
misirables
be
,
by
any
account
,
a
epic
,
both
in
its
scope
and
in
its
length
.
while
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
cram
everything
from
its
page
into
a
two
hour
movie
,
this
latest
attempt
do
a
admirable
job
at
the
translation
.
it
,
too
,
be
a
epic
...
and
one
worth
see
.
