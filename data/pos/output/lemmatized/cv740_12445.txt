a
couple
of
month
ago
,
when
i
first
download
the
face\/off
trailer
from
the
net
,
my
initial
reaction
be
a
fourteen
carrot
gold
`
yawn
'
.
follow
swiftly
by
a
press
of
my
computer
delete
key
,
not
want
to
waste
six
or
seven
megabyte
of
precious
space
on
this
piss-poor
trailer
.
then
i
start
read
the
first
wave
of
review
from
the
u
.
s
...
unique
...
excellent
...
must-see
.
well
,
i
think
still
skeptical
,
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
go
see
it
when
it
get
here
.
`
here
'
,
of
course
,
be
still
three
month
away
.
i
'll
admit
,
when
i
trot
off
to
see
this
film
,
the
only
john
woo
movie
i
have
see
before
be
the
fairly
enjoyable
but
highly
forgetable
broken
arrow
.
i
would
hear
good
thing
about
he
previous
work
with
movie
like
hard
boil
,
but
he
film
be
definitely
not
on
my
must-see
list
.
that
,
let
I
tell
you
,
have
change
completely
.
i
know
this
fact
only
five
minute
into
the
film
,
after
the
brilliantly
shoot
and
act
opening
sequence
where
sean
archer
lose
he
son
blow
I
off
my
foot
.
the
act
throughout
the
film
be
staggeringly
good
for
a
action
flick
.
seriously
.
i
have
never
be
a
big
john
travolta
fan
,
but
he
,
like
cage
,
perfectly
suit
he
role
in
the
movie
...
sorry
,
make
that
`
role
'
in
the
movie
.
even
travolta
's
great
performance
,
however
,
pale
in
comparison
to
cage
's
character
portrayal
.
my
favorite
cage
scene
be
definitely
when
he
be
crash
out
in
compardre
dietrich
hassler
's
hideout
.
half
drug
out
of
he
mind
,
he
sit
there
recline
back
in
a
chair
talk
about
he
son
's
death
from
castor
's
perspective
-
''
do
not
it
just
break
you
heart
.
''
he
mutter
coldly
.
now
do
not
go
think
from
the
previous
comment
about
brilliant
act
that
this
be
a
drama
focus
movie
-
it
be
not
.
that
be
what
really
make
this
movie
unique
.
it
be
a
action
movie
with
brilliantly
portray
character
...
not
a
common
mix
at
all
.
suspension
of
disbelief
be
paramount
in
this
movie
though
...
that
be
the
only
way
to
overlook
the
fact
that
travolta
and
cage
fire
around
5671
round
at
each
other
...
and
never
hit
.
several
action
scene
be
just
so
well
choreograph
that
they
just
make
wish
that
you
could
press
`
rewind
'
and
watch
it
over
again
.
the
part
where
archer
and
troy
have
a
stand
off
on
either
side
of
a
double-sided
mirror
be
just
plain
brilliant
.
whilst
cage
's
and
travolta
's
performance
would
be
enough
alone
to
sustain
most
movie
,
the
lesser
character
be
just
as
intriguing
.
joan
allen
,
who
usually
stick
to
the
straight
drama
movie
,
play
she
part
perfectly
as
archer
's
long
suffering
wife
.
i
like
the
fact
that
she
character
do
not
end
up
tote
a
gun
at
the
end
of
the
movie
...
it
would
have
wreck
she
potrayal
.
gina
gershon
be
surprising
to
say
the
least
as
castor
troy
's
mistreat
girlfriend
...
make
that
\*
one
of
\*
castor
troy
's
mistreat
girlfriend
.
other
movie
would
have
use
she
character
as
just
window
dress
...
a
sex
object
,
but
instead
she
character
be
very
strong
and
independent
.
dominique
swain
,
who
play
archer
's
daughter
,
also
do
a
nice
job
,
though
she
character
be
not
as
explore
as
much
as
allen
's
or
gershon
's
.
fault
?
well
...
there
be
some
i
have
to
say
.
first
,
the
movie
's
end
,
whilst
be
very
good
overall
,
be
a
bit
too
draw
out
for
it
be
own
good
.
after
the
two
combatant
begin
duel
again
after
the
final
boat
crash
you
can
not
help
but
think
-
''
geez
,
be
you
guy
nuclear
power
or
what
?
''
.
there
be
certain
bit
that
be
not
handle
properly
,
like
where
archer
appear
safe
and
sound
on
solid
ground
after
jump
off
the
convert
oil
platform\/prison
-
more
explanation
here
would
have
be
nice
.
overall
,
this
movie
be
not
perfect
.
but
i
think
it
be
about
as
close
as
a
action
movie
have
ever
come
to
perfect
.
many
critic
have
claim
that
this
movie
will
change
the
way
action
movie
be
make
...
i
certainly
hope
so
.
