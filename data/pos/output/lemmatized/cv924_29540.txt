the
most
amazing
thing
about
paul
cox
's
innocence
be
how
unlike
a
movie
it
be
.
i
mean
that
as
the
highest
compliment
.
if
most
studio
be
to
profile
a
elderly
couple
who
rekindle
a
40-year-old
romance
,
i
would
want
to
run
and
hide
.
the
sex
scene
would
be
handle
as
a
farce
,
producer
would
shed
20
year
off
the
character
'
age
-lrb-
so
susan
sarandon
and
harrison
ford
could
star
-rrb-
and
true
love
would
shine
through
any
obstacle
without
explanation
and
consequence
.
along
with
a
charming
romantic
story
,
the
australian\/belgian
innocence
show
how
a
increase
sense
of
mortality
combine
with
revisit
the
past
while
be
entrench
in
the
present
can
make
something
that
seem
so
right
seem
downright
questionable
.
the
romance
get
start
when
former
musician
andrea
-lrb-
charle
''
bud
''
tingwell
-rrb-
,
learn
that
he
true
love
,
claire
-lrb-
julium
blake
-rrb-
,
live
nearby
.
they
decide
to
catch
up
on
old
time
,
but
soon
find
themselves
in
a
reinvigorate
affair
.
complicate
matter
be
andrea
'
frail
health
,
and
claire
's
longtime
husband
-lrb-
terry
norri
-rrb-
,
who
can
not
understand
why
he
be
suddenly
become
obsolete
.
in
my
mind
,
the
movie
be
less
about
the
relationship
between
andrea
and
claire
,
than
the
feeling
of
everyone
involve
.
john
,
claire
's
husband
,
endlessly
question
what
he
do
wrong
.
claire
initially
insist
she
be
a
grown-up
,
but
admittedly
behave
like
a
child
,
a
prospect
that
thrill
and
disappoint
she
.
andrea
,
a
agnostic
,
begin
to
question
he
fate
,
a
message
cox
deliver
in
a
memorable
dream
sequence
.
cox
litter
the
movie
with
flashback
,
include
the
repeat
vision
of
a
roar
train
.
it
be
a
reminder
of
andrea
and
claire
's
past
love
-lrb-
as
young
lover
,
they
meet
by
train
-rrb-
,
but
as
it
recur
,
we
get
the
feeling
that
the
past
and
the
present
have
clash
.
a
pall
be
cast
on
the
whole
affair
.
a
master
of
the
understate
,
cox
string
together
a
series
of
memorable
moment
.
in
andrea
'
dream
sequence
,
amidst
the
roar
of
the
train
and
conversation
,
we
get
the
whole
picture
of
andrea
and
claire
's
love
.
we
also
get
glimpse
into
john
and
claire
's
relationship
.
during
a
silent
candlelit
dinner
shortly
afterward
,
claire
admit
to
john
about
she
indiscretion
,
tell
more
than
any
monologue
could
.
all
that
be
hear
be
the
scrape
of
fork
against
plate
.
the
character
be
unlike
anything
i
have
see
--
they
be
people
.
so
many
time
,
movie
and
especially
television
portray
senior
citizen
as
gratingly
spunky
.
or
they
be
reduce
to
comedic
buffoon
.
ordinary
people
with
a
pile
of
emotion
,
claire
and
andrea
be
not
sure
what
the
next
step
be
.
they
do
want
to
be
happy
,
which
consist
of
a
entirely
different
set
of
condition
than
what
they
have
know
throughout
they
adult
life
.
bravo
to
cox
,
who
write
the
script
,
for
not
make
john
a
monster
,
so
that
claire
's
affair
be
automatically
justified
.
norri
be
so
effective
as
john
that
he
make
andrea
and
claire
's
love
difficult
to
accept
.
we
feel
for
he
.
he
be
a
decent
man
.
sure
,
he
may
have
become
complacent
,
but
he
never
expect
this
,
especially
now
.
with
so
much
present
to
the
audience
,
it
be
only
expect
that
the
material
get
a
little
draw
out
and
repetitive
,
which
it
do
.
however
,
in
bring
up
tough
question
and
not
offer
easy
answer
,
cox
display
a
skill
and
?
lan
be
not
likely
to
be
surpass
by
anyone
anytime
soon
.
