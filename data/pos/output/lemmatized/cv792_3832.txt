,
progenitor
of
the
computer
age
and
critically
important
mathematician
on

manhattan
project
,
point
out
long
ago
that
there
be
a
great
way
to
explore
the
cosmos
,
even
without
recourse
to
faster-than
light
travel
.
you
send
out
self-replicating
robot
ship
which
explore
and
radio
back
information
.
it
may
take
decade
,
century
,
or
millennium
,
but
it
can
be
do
with
achievable
technology
,
and
do
not
require
a
magical
faster-than-light
drive
.

hoyle
improve
on
this
plan
by
suggest
that
it
would
be
better
to
radio
plan
for
a
complex
computer
and
a
program
for
it
;
any
civilization
capable
of
receive
the
transmission
could
build
the
computer
,
which
would
then
engage
in
a
real-time
dialog
with
the
alien
,
exchange
information
and
technology
,
and
hopefully
arrange
to
send
back
what
it
have
learn

for

they

,
and
then
disintegrate
into

of

action

only
by
the

also
serve
poorly
by

be
relatively
simple

note
that
,
in
the
1970
's
,
we
really
do
not
know
diddly
about
the
human

,

even

all
we

but
the
performance

elicit
from
the

disappointing

bland

apparent
that

giger

actually
a

boring

finally
get
to
see
it

although

quite
smoothly

the
main
fault
of
species
be
lack
of
originality
;
it
start
out
with
a
wonderful
,
albeit
borrow
,
premise
,
and
then
do
not
live
up
to
it
.
all
we
get
be
chase
scene
and
a
few
nice
sex
scene
,
with
a
few
monster
toss
in
.
there
be
no
buildup
of
tension
and
suspense
,
no
climax
worthy
of

species
be
just
a
sequence
of

the
movie
be

by
its
chase
and
sex
scene
,
but
not

on
the
other
hand

two

by

large

it
be
fun
only
for

my
personal
rating
be
three
star

but
knock
one

two
of
those
off
if
you
do

enjoy

unclothed
