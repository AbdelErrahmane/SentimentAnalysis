i
finish
mike

''
leave
las
vegas
''
hour
ago
,
and
it
be
still
as
haunting
as
when
i
hit
rewind
on
the
vcr
.
alot
of
people
refer
to
this
film
as
''
that
flick
where
nick
cage
play
that
alcoholic
dude
''
.
''
leave
las
vegas
''
be
not
so
much
a
movie
about
alcoholism
as
it
be
a
story
about
two
people
who
except
each
other
for
what
they
be
:
a
drunk
and
a
whore
.
ben
-lrb-
nicolas
cage
in
possibly
the
best
male
performance
of
the
past
twenty
year
-rrb-
be
the
drunk
.
he
family
and
friend
have
long
since
abandon
he
,
and
all
he
have
leave
be
he
liquor
.
in
a
scene
early
in
the
film
,
we
see
ben
staggering
into
a
resteraunt
,
look
for
a
''
friend
''
of
he
to
mooch
some
money
off
of
.
he
find
the
guy
-lrb-
richard
lewi
-rrb-
have
dinner
with
a
buddy
and
two
chick
,
try
to
crack
witty
joke
that
just
come
out
stupid
.
when
ben
approach
the
table
,
you
can
clearly
sense
that
everyone
immediatly
feel
uncomfortable
.
after
lewi
give
ben
the
money
,
he
coldly
say
''
i
think
it
would
be
best
if
you
do
not
contact
I
again
.
''
now
even
though
through
the
course
of
the
film
,
some
much
more
depressing
thing
happen
,
this
be
when
i
feel
the
most
for
ben
.
there
be
such
a
look
of
sorrow
and
dispare
on
he
face
,
-lrb-
not
to
sound
hokey
or
anything
-rrb-
it
almost
bring
a
tear
to
my
eye
.
it
turn
out
that
ben
be
once
a
semi-successful
hollywood
player
,
and
apparently
a
pretty
popular
guy
.
now
he
spend
he
time
get
rob
by
hooker
and
try
desperatly
to
pick
up
woman
,
not
so
much
for
the
sex
,
but
for
the
company
;
for
someone
to
talk
to
or
spend
time
with
.
once
he
be
fire
from
he
job
,
ben
decide
to
burn
all
he
belongings
,
collect
all
he
cash
and
relocate
to
las
vegas
to
slowly
drink
himself
to
death
.
one
night
he
run
into
a
prostitute
-lrb-
a
brilliant
performance
by
elizabeth
shue
-
how
far
she
have
come
since
''
adventure
in
babysitting
''
-rrb-
name
serum
.
she
be
involve
in
a
abusive
relationship
with
she
pimp
,
a
scumbag
who
gets-off
by
cut
she
.
they
be
both
very
lonely
,
self-destructive
people
.
they
immediatly
hit
it
off
,
both
of
they
realize
that
they
need
one
another
.
and
it
be
not
even
a
sexual
relationship
.
they
do
not
even
have
sex
until
,
like
,
the
last
ten
minute
of
the
film
.
''
leave
las
vegas
''
be
not
a
film
about
plot
.
with
the
exception
of
what
i
have
already
reveal
-lrb-
which
all
happen
in
the
first
thirty
minute
or
so
,
by
the
way
-rrb-
,
there
be
not
too
much
of
a
story
to
it
.
it
be
more
a
film
about
people
and
how
they
react
to
one
another
.
from
what
i
can
see
,
this
be
basically
a
perfect
film
.
the
direction
be
great
-lrb-
with
mike
figgi
do
a
brilliant
mix
between
the
glamor
of
las
vegas
and
the
moody
,
smokey
atmosphere
of
a
film
noir
-rrb-
and
it
contain
two
of
the
best
performance
to
come
out
of
the
90
,
or
any
other
decade
for
that
matter
.
but
do
not
go
rush
out
to
see
this
movie
without
know
what
you
be
get
yourself
into
.
first
off
,
if
you
be
easily
offend
by
frank
sexual
dialouge
,
stay
away
from
''
leave
las
vegas
''
.
it
be
fill
with
lengthy
discussion
of
orgasm
,
rape
and
various
form
of
perverted
activity
involve
burbon
-lrb-
that
be
right
-rrb-
.
secondly
,
if
you
be
not
in
the
mood
to
see
a
very
depressing
film
,
do
not
see
it
.
however
,
if
you
be
cool
with
those
two
thing
,
you
be
in
for
one
of
the
most
memorable
experience
you
will
ever
have
.
