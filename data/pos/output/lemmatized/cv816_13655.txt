in
my
review
of
there
be
something
about
mary
,
i
say
something
to
the
effect
of
''
laughter
be
not
everything
.
''
i
now
need
to
make
a
brief
addendum
to
my
postulate
:
laughter
be
not
everything
,
unless
i
be
watch
a
jim
abraham
film
.
see
,
spoof
be
easy
with
I
.
i
love
movie
,
and
i
love
movie
that
make
fun
of
movie
that
i
love
.
sometimes
i
be
the
only
one
in
the
theater
laughing
.
sometimes
i
laugh
so
hard
that
i
embarass
myself
because
my
laugh
be
so
high-pitched
in
comparison
to
my
speak
voice
-lrb-
it
cut
right
through
everyone
else
's
laughter
-rrb-
.
sometimes
i
laugh
so
much
that
my
cheekbone
be
sore
by
the
end
of
the
film
.
abraham
's
latest
film
,
mafia
!
,
induce
this
kind
of
hysteria
upon
I
.
it
be
get
some
mediocre
review
,
but
,
hey
,
i
be
the
guy
who
laugh
at
everything
.
there
may
be
a
lot
of
joke
that
flop
in
this
film
,
but
there
be
far
more
that
work
,
and
i
laugh
so
frequently
that
the
fail
joke
usually
occur
as
i
be
recover
from
the
previous
bout
of
giddy
madness
.
i
enjoy
film
like
this
because
not
one
second
of
it
be
serious
or
thought-provoking
.
most
lighweight
film
that
pose
as
comedy
try
to
do
other
thing
,
like
develop
character
,
shape
story
,
and
other
such
nonsense
.
mafia
!
have
no
pretention
about
character
or
story
,
and
it
exist
for
no
other
reason
than
to
make
people
laugh
.
the
film
begin
on
the
perfect
high
note
,
with
a
mockery
of
the
opening
of
casino
.
we
hero
-lrb-
jay
mohr
-rrb-
be
see
walk
from
a
casino
and
get
into
he
car
,
which
subsequently
explode
and
send
he
fly
through
the
air
against
a
backdrop
of
flow
fire
.
to
describe
the
story
of
mafia
!
be
absurd
and
pointless
,
but
i
will
mention
that
it
basically
follow
the
framework
of
the
godfather
film
,
with
a
lot
of
casino
reference
insert
throughout
.
along
the
way
,
the
parody
seem
arbitrary
,
and
rarely
victimize
mob
film
:
picture
like
the
english
patient
,
forrest
gump
,
and
jaw
undergo
severe
and
hilarious
bash
.
movie
like
this
rely
on
just
a
few
thing
,
but
the
most
important
element
be
direction
.
abraham
have
be
down
this
path
many
time
before
-lrb-
hot
shot
!
,
top
secret
!
,
airplane
!
,
and
any
other
film
with
a
exclamation
point
in
the
title
-rrb-
,
and
so
i
hold
most
of
the
success
of
mafia
!
to
he
experience
.
he
take
just
the
right
attitude
in
each
scene
,
and
manage
to
wring
at
least
a
bit
laughter
out
of
even
the
most
oddly
place
reference
-lrb-
one
inexplicable
moment
seem
like
it
want
to
make
fun
of
titanic
,
but
it
never
develop
-rrb-
.
the
actor
be
all
energetic
,
which
help
a
lot
with
the
tone
of
the
film
.
mohr
-lrb-
suicide
king
,
paulie
-rrb-
,
who
be
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
actor
,
be
so
good
here
.
he
look
like
he
be
have
so
much
fun
that
he
be
contain
he
laughter
in
every
scene
-lrb-
watch
he
face
in
the
sequence
by
the
swimming
pool
-rrb-
.
he
be
probably
the
only
performer
in
the
cast
who
manage
to
urge
laughter
without
the
help
of
the
material
.
lloyd
bridge
do
a
decent
imitation
of
brando
's
godfather
,
while
pamelum
gidley
be
dead-on
in
a
full-blown
mockery
of
sharon
stone
.
the
hard
thing
about
write
review
for
comedy
be
that
i
be
suppose
to
give
example
of
thing
and
be
specific
.
unfortunately
,
i
be
so
constantly
blindside
by
laughter
during
mafia
!
that
i
can
not
remember
a
lot
of
what
make
I
laugh
.
but
that
be
a
good
sign
:
mafia
!
be
so
funny
that
i
be
not
even
give
time
to
apply
any
of
the
scene
to
memory
.
i
laugh
so
hard
that
it
shut
off
my
brain
.
i
know
that
do
not
sound
particularly
complimentary
,
but
when
watch
a
dumb
comedy
like
this
,
the
first
thing
i
want
to
do
be
shut
off
my
brain
.
finally
,
a
film
that
do
this
for
I
.
