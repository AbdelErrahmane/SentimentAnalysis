several

in

film
,
such
as
the
one
in
which
robocop
employ
he
extremely
precise
aim
to
stop

,
be
destine
to
become
cult-classic
.
because
robocop
be
so
visually
and
emotionally
rouse
,
it
demand
to
be
see
on
a
large
screen
with
a
audience
--
in
other
word
,
in
a
movie
theater
.
although
the
special
effect
and
action
be
exciting
,
they
do
not
by
themselves
set
robocop
apart
from
other
film
in
the
genre
.
rather
,
robocop
stand
out
for
its
accurate
and
biting
satire
of
american
society
.
the
movie
make
a
mockery
of

,
terrorism
,
board

,
and
television
news
broadcast

these

which
be
exceptionally
clever
,
recur
periodically
throughout
the
movie
and
help
to
provide
comic
relief
from
the
intense
action
and
gore
.
the
satire
in
robocop
,
however
,
be
almost
as
frightening
in
its
own
way
as
the
suspense
and
blood
.
1990
's
america
,
as
portray
in
the
film
,
may
seem
far
fetch
but
be
in
actuality
-lrb-
i
think
-rrb-
only
a
slight
exaggeration
of
the
current
state
of
american
society
.
the
humorous
satire
in
robocop
be
simultaneously
credible
and
absurd
.
verhoeven
adroitly
balance
the
satirical
comedy
with
the
gory
action
to
create
a
entertaining
and
enlighten
piece
of
science
fiction\/social
commentary
.
unfortunately
,
robocop
possess
several
flaw
which
prevent
it
from
qualify
as
a
classic
within
the
genre
.
the
movie
lack
the
lasting
impact
of
such
film
as
the
road
warrior
,
the
terminator
,
and
alien
.
robocop
's
main
problem
,
aside
from
its
dumb
title
,
be
that
it
do
not
sufficiently
develop
murphy
's
character
.
we
never
learn
the
degree
to
which
murphy
-lrb-
as
robocop
-rrb-
be
human
and
the
degree
to
which
he
be
a
robot
.
do
murphy
have
any
human
spirit
or
free
will
left
,
or
be
he
merely
a
computer
follow
a
program
?
the
script
halfheartedly
raise
these
issue
but
then
abandon
they
in
its
climactic
flurry
of
gory
action
.
moreover
,
it
almost
completely
ignore
the
question
-lrb-
and
tragedy
-rrb-
of
deny
a
man
he
right
to
die
in
favor
of
turn
he
into
a
machine
.
robocop
also
contain
several
bothersome
loose-end
.
as
you
watch
robocop
,
you
experience
deja
vu
;
you
feel
as
if
you
have
see
the
film
before
.
in
many
respects
,
robocop
be
reminiscent
of
several
other
film
,
include
the
terminator
,
return
of
the
jedus
,
and
even
death
wish
.
however
,
to
its
credit
,
robocop
easily
have
enough
originality
and
unique
personality
to
avoid
become
a
cheap
rip-off
.
