he
ripe
old
age
,
be
cash
one
talent
in
for
another
.
midnight
in
the
garden
of
good
and
evil
be
a
eastwood-directed
film
clint
be
not
even
in
,
and
it
be
damn
good
.
adapt
from
a
best-selling
john
berendt
novel
base
on
true
event
,
this
movie
be
set
in
the
bizarre
georgium
town
of
savannah
,
where
people
walk
invisible
dog
and
attach
horsefly
to
they
head
.
and
that
be
just
the
mayor
.
as
director
and
producer
,
eastwood
contribute
a
self
-
indulgent
but
very
competent
150
minute
,
neatly
balance
drama
,
suspense
and
humor
.
like
all
great
movie
,
midnight
in
the
garden
have
a
lot
of
funny
moment
that
spring
from
the
character
themselves
,
and
not
from
some
contrived
,
juvenile
intrusion
.
the
act
,
from
big-time
star
john
cusack
and
kevin
spacey
,
be
as
good
as
you
would
expect
,
but
it
be
the
support
stable
that
give
the
movie
its
offbeat
charm
.
cusack
play
a
free-lance
reporter
send
to
savannah
to
write
a
fluff
story
for
town
&
country
magazine
about
one
of
eccentric
millionaire
spacey
's
party
.
lot
of
food
,
beverage
and
gunplay
.
yes
,
a
employee
of
spacey
's
have
a
huge
argument
in
front
of
cusack
and
later
turn
up
dead
.
it
seem
like
a
simple
matter
of
self
-
defense
--
the
guy
threaten
spacey
,
shoot
at
he
,
miss
,
then
spacey
take
he
out
--
but
be
a
movie
,
there
be
much
more
to
it
than
that
,
and
cusack
decide
to
stay
in
town
and
write
a
book
about
the
murder
,
a
book
which
will
eventually
become
a
movie
he
will
star
in
.
the
weird
circle
of
entertainment
.
this
be
where
the
stable
of
support
character
come
in
.
there
be
the
requisite
sexy
woman
-lrb-
alison
''
nepotist
's
daughter
''
eastwood
-rrb-
,
the
strange
piano
player
,
the
voodoo
woman
and
the
transvestite
.
miss
chabli
deserve
a
paragraph
of
his\/her
own
,
as
the
stealer
of
every
scene
she
appear
in
--
what
would
this
movie
be
without
the
castilian
scene
and
she
testimony
?
chabli
,
play
herself
,
be
five
time
funnier
than
reign
drag
queen
rupaul
,
but
never
seem
exploit
as
the
movie
's
comic
relief
or
out
of
place
in
a
basically
serious
movie
.
there
be
also
a
fair
share
of
courtroom
scene
,
which
these
day
almost
never
seem
welcome
in
a
movie
,
but
even
here
clint
manage
to
keep
the
movie
fascinating
.
certainly
the
characterization
of
the
judge
and
spacey
's
lawyer
both
help
immensely
,
as
do
have
the
fly-guy
as
the
jury
's
foreman
.
it
be
here
we
realize
the
case
boil
down
to
a
indictment
of
spacey
's
homosexuality
.
yes
,
spacey
have
a
sexual
relationship
with
the
dead
man
--
before
he
shoot
he
,
of
course
.
midnight
in
the
garden
of
good
and
evil
be
not
a
classic
,
but
it
be
one
of
the
better
celebrity-directed
,
true-story
best-seller
adaptation
out
there
.
likewise
,
no
one
from
this
movie
will
be
get
any
oscar
nomination
,
but
the
performance
be
all
great
.
in
fact
,
i
would
almost
recommend
that
the
academy
add
a
best
supporting
transvestite
category
.
serve
america
for
more
than
1\/25th
of
a
century
!
