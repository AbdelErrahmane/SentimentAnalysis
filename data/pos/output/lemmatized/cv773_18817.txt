when
a
someone
journey
to
the
theater
to
see
a
comedy
,
he
always
risk
have
to
sit
through
inanity
such
as
what
we
recently
see
in
film
like
edtv
and
office
space
.
it
really
be
too
bad
that
comedy
be
so
hit
-
and-miss
,
because
when
a
moviegoer
go
in
a
theater
expect
to
be
amuse
,
it
really
be
a
shame
when
the
allege
comedy
fail
to
deliver
.
but
weep
not
,
dear
reader
,
because
the
latest
comedy
out
of
the
hollywood
movie
mill
be
nothing
less
than
a
sure
bet
.
austin
power
:
the
spy
who
shag
I
be
one
of
the
funniest
thing
i
have
have
the
pleasure
to
see
in
a
long
time
;
a
completely
looney
,
delightful
parody
of
the
often
pretentious
jame
bond
flick
.
if
all
comedy
-lrb-
or
even
half
;
or
-
-
what
be
i
say
?
--
even
a
fifth
of
they
-rrb-
could
be
this
consistently
hysterical
,
i
would
take
up
residence
at
my
local
multiplex
.
even
more
to
this
movie
's
credit
be
the
fact
that
it
be
a
sequel
to
the
1997
sleeper\/cult
hit
austin
power
:
international
man
of
mystery
.
the
original
come
out
of
nowhere
;
it
be
a
low-budget
,
eccentric
movie
that
many
expect
to
flop
like
a
leslie
nielsen
parody
.
all
of
a
sudden
it
be
be
quote
by
teenager
all
over
america
.
ironically
,
power
'
''
yeeeeah
baby
,
yeah
!
''
have
almost
become
a
icon
of
the
late
90
.
thus
another
installment
be
inevitable
,
but
it
be
also
undoubtedly
welcome
.
the
spy
who
shag
I
be
one
of
the
most
unrestrained
,
over
-
the-top
comedy
i
have
ever
see
in
my
entire
life
.
it
bring
back
most
of
the
character
from
its
predecessor
-lrb-
even
if
only
briefly
-rrb-
and
add
new
one
.
austin
power
-lrb-
mike
myer
-rrb-
,
a
swing
hipster
from
the
60
transport
into
the
90
have
to
go
back
to
he
own
time
to
get
back
he
mojo
-lrb-
oh
,
you
'll
figure
it
out
-rrb-
,
which
dr
.
evil
-lrb-
meyer
again
-rrb-
have
steal
.
he
enlist
the
help
of
a
gorgeous
secret
agent
felicity
shagwell
-lrb-
now
that
he
prior
sidekick
vanessa
have
be
properly
dispose
of
in
a
hilarious
opening
sequence
-rrb-
,
play
without
much
distinguishable
gusto
by
heather
graham
and
together
they
go
back
to
the
60
to
defeat
dr
.
evil
yet
again
.
surprisingly
,
the
real
star
be
dr
.
evil
rather
than
austin
.
he
get
most
of
the
screen
time
because
he
be
so
popular
in
the
first
movie
.
perhaps
this
be
true
because
he
be
portray
and
write
so
affectionately
.
instead
of
be
the
scheming
,
villainous
mad
scientist
we
might
expect
from
a
character
like
this
he
be
a
bumble
,
often
sweet
mad
scientist
wannabe
.
the
spy
who
shag
I
have
much
of
the
same
stuff
we
see
in
the
original
,
but
that
be
okay
by
I
because
the
original
leave
we
want
more
.
by
the
time
that
one
be
over
we
have
not
have
nearly
we
share
of
shag
joke
,
crude
pun
and
power
'
antic
and
this
sequel
satisfy
we
appetite
.
even
by
its
conclusion
,
i
be
still
not
sure
i
have
have
my
fill
of
bit
like
''
do
you
smoke
after
sex
?
''
''
i
do
not
know
,
baby
,
i
never
look
.
''
this
may
seem
awfully
immature
of
I
,
but
understand
that
the
austin
power
series
,
unlike
most
of
the
crap
hollywood
feed
we
these
day
,
be
genuinely
funny
.
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
ever
laugh
harder
at
any
movie
than
i
do
during
the
jerry
springer
send
up
or
the
indubitably
hilarious
''
just
the
two
of
we
''
rendition
by
dr
.
evil
and
he
new
miniature
clone
name
''
mini-me
''
.
i
do
not
have
any
pretension
that
this
be
particularly
smart
social
satire
or
anything
of
the
sort
.
indeed
there
be
little
beyond
the
joy
a
viewer
feel
when
he
see
something
that
be
able
to
entertain
he
as
much
as
this
movie
do
.
but
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
,
that
be
enough
.
