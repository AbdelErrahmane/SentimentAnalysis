i
do
not
want
to
give
away
too
much
of
the
story
of
''
session

,
''
so
i
'll
stop
there
.
what
we
have
here
be
a
spooky
horror
flick
that
use
none
of
the
jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark
cheap
shot
that
have
become
part
and
parcel
with
horror
film
since
the
advent
of
''
halloween
''
and
''
Friday
the
thirteenth
.
''
there
be
no
cat
leap
out
of
the
dark
or
the
shock
of
suddenly
see
oneself
in
a
strategically
place
mirror
.
with
the
exception
of
one
shadowy
and
chill
image
at
one
point
spooky
interlude
in
the
film
,
there
be
little
that
you
can
get
you
arm
around
as
far
as
what
,
specifically
,
be
''
frightening
.
''
as
i
watch
''
session
9
''
i
become
aware
of
the
subtle
thing
that
build
up
during
the
story
that
make
it
a
true
horror
movie
.
the
striking
high-definition
video
camera
work
by

briesewitz
-lrb-
who
work
with
the
director
,
brad
anderson
,
on

''
-rrb-
help
to
build
up
tension
with
close-up
,
fluid
camera
movement
and
odd
angle
in
a
way
that
would
make
alfred
hitchcock
proud
.
music
,
too
,
be
use
to
intense
effect
,
join
with
the
camera
to
make
simple
scene
frightening
,
even
horrifying
.
couple
these
tech
feat
with
a
intelligent
story
that
use
element
of
''
the
shine
,
''
''
the
blair
witch
project
''
and
,
even
''
the
texa
chainsaw
massacre
''
and
you
get
a
decent
,
intriguing
horror
flick
.
additionally
,
the
brilliant
decision
to
shoot
at
danvers
state
hospital
give
the
film
another
star
character
,
the
institution
itself
,
which
lend
even
more
chill
to
the
equation
.
act
be
another
factor
that
raise
''
session

''
above
the
usual
dreck
present
in
recent
horror
hit
like
''
scream
,
''
''
i
know
what
you
do
last
summer
''
and
they
sequel
.
those
film
take
good-looking
,
though
generic
,
young
actor
and
actress
and
put
they
to
use
to
build
up
a
body
count
,
substitute
mayhem
for
real
horror
.
anderson
opt
,
instead
,
to
use
mature
,
experienced
actor
like
peter
mullan
and
david
caruso
to
fill
he
character
'
shoe
and
the
difference
in
cast
quality
be
notable
.
mullan
,
in
particular
,
put
a
arc
on
he
character
,
gordon
,
as
the
troubled
guy
who
slowly
and
inexorably
fall
under
the
pressure
of
family
,
job
and
,
finally
,
danvers
state
hospital
.
the
rest
of
the
small
cast
fit
the
bill
as
people
,
not
just
fodder
for
the
mayhem
.
david
caruso
,
as
gordo
's
senior
man
and
near
equal
in
the
business
,
show
just
how
good
a
actor
he
be
.
he
make
the
jump
from
tv
's
''
nypd
blue
''
to
film
far
too
soon
and
he
decision
in
the
role
he
take
-lrb-
i
'll
never
forget
the
horrendous
''
jade
''
-rrb-
be
less
than
star
making
.
he
roll
he
sleeve
up
and
do
the
job
well
here
.
gevedon
,
luca
and
sexton
be
more
than
fodder
,
too
.
the
only
problem
with
''
session
9
''
lay
in
the
uninspired
ending
.
it
take
on
a
fairly
conventional
finale
that
cover
old
ground
and
be
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
after
the
terrific
-lrb-
and
inspire
-rrb-
build
up
.
the
pleasure
be
get
there
and
i
wish
that
anderson
and
gevedon
have
keep
up
the
steam
they
have
so
ably
build
during
the
bulk
of
the
film
''
session
9
''
be
a
unusual
feat
.
it
be
scary
,
do
not
use
cheap
trick
and
raise
goose
bump
with
its
intelligently
render
,
subtle
horror
.
because
of
the
local
interest
of
danver
,
it
should
do
well
with
the
northeast
crowd
.
i
hope
it
get
the
national
distribution
it
deserve
.
i
give
it
a
b

.
