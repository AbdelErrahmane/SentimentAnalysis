one
day
,
nesmith
be
greet
by
a
especially
fanatical
group
of
''

''
follower
.
they
be
actually
alien
from
a
planet
know
as
thermium
.
they
have
mistake
the
''
galaxy

''
episode
for
historical
documentation
of
actual
heroic
space
travel
.
the
next
day
,
the
thermian
whisk
nesmith
away
to
a
spaceship
to
help
they
defeat
the
evil

nesmith
think
it
be
only
a
elaborate
gig

sort

blow
it
off
,
but
when
he
be
transport

or
i
should
say
shot

back
to
earth
in
a
rather
celestial
manner
,
he
believe

next
thing
the
cast
know
,
they
be
be
drag
by
nesmith
to
this
spaceship

of
course
,
they
all
think
he
be
out
of
he
mind
and
once
he
do
convince
they
that
there
really
be
a
spaceship
,
what
they
want
to
do
be
get
out
of
there
as
fast
as
the
transporter
will
take

.
but
after
some
persuade
,
they
stay
on
to
fight
the
icky
sarri
and
find
a
way
to
provide
a
peaceful
existance
for
the
flail
thermian
.
i
be
quite
surprised
how
well
this
comedy
,
which
come
off
as
utterly
brainless
from
its
marketing
campaign
,
work
.
take
shot
at
both
the
obvious
and
not-so-obvious
element
of
star
trek
and
its
fandom
,
galaxy

never
go
for
cheap
laugh
,
opt
instead
for
broad
but
smart
parody
.
nothing
be
safe
--
not
the
cliche
,
not
the
fan
,
not
the
absurd
tagline
--
but
on
the
other
hand
,
everything
be
safe
,
since
galaxy
quest
treat
its
subject
with
utter
respect
and
sometimes
even
subtle
admiration
.
the
highlight
of
the
movie
be

a

tech
sergeant
chen
who
,
when
in

,
be

complete
opposite

would
constantly
yell
