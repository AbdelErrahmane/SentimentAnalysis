i
rent
this
movie
with
very
high
hope
.
this
movie
get
praise
as
one
of
the
best
film
of
1998
,
and
unfortunately
,
be
not
as
good
as
i
hope
,
but
be
still
very
intriguing
and
think
provoke
.
first
of
all
,
the
casting
for
this
film
be
great
.
tobey
maguire
and
reese
witherspoon
be
the
future
of
hollywood
.
they
play
they
role
as
the
parker
brother
and
sister
perfectly
.
with
a
plot
as
unbelievable
as
this
film
,
you
need
chemistry
and
honest
act
from
you
cast
.
tobey
and
reese
-lrb-
bud
and
mary
sue
parker
-rrb-
play
they
role
perfectly
and
display
they
character
with
honesty
and
believability
.
william
h
.
macy
,
a
actor
i
have
grow
to
love
over
the
past
year
,
turn
in
another
great
performance
as
the
tv
dad
who
be
tear
over
he
wife
,
a
''
color
''
person
and
he
friend
,
the
''
non-colored
''
one
.
he
also
display
believability
and
must
display
a
certain
lack
of
chemistry
with
he
wife
.
he
do
this
perfectly
and
yet
again
show
why
he
should
be
one
of
the
top
actor
in
hollywood
.
joan
allen
be
equally
great
as
betty
parker
,
the
ideal
tv
mom
.
she
character
be
the
most
ambitious
.
she
be
very
na
?
ve
,
and
must
display
this
well
to
make
she
character
believable
and
she
do
just
that
.
she
lack
of
chemistry
with
macy
,
which
the
role
call
for
,
and
she
developed
chemistry
with
jeff
daniel
be
terrific
,
and
if
daniel
would
have
be
as
stellar
as
the
rest
of
the
cast
,
then
this
film
would
even
be
even
better
.
as
say
before
,
jeff
daniel
give
a
bad
performance
.
he
character
display
the
change
go
on
throughout
the
town
,
yet
he
do
not
display
it
with
enough
conviction
.
he
character
be
very
confusing
and
he
be
not
very
believable
.
this
film
could
have
be
elevated
to
a
whole
new
level
have
daniel
be
able
to
give
a
better
performance
.
the
movie
be
very
provocative
.
it
challenge
the
issue
of
racism
that
exist
in
the
past
and
that
still
exist
today
.
i
really
be
not
expect
all
of
the
element
they
bring
up
,
but
they
pull
they
off
with
such
flair
that
it
be
mind
blowing
.
they
demonstrate
the
racism
issue
without
a
hitch
,
but
do
it
in
a
slow
pace
.
the
only
major
flaw
in
the
film
besides
the
performance
by
daniel
be
length
.
some
film
be
not
mean
to
be
that
long
.
pleasantville
be
one
of
those
film
.
this
film
could
have
be
so
much
better
have
they
not
move
so
slowly
to
it
.
first
,
they
be
amaze
by
the
implementation
of
color
.
then
they
want
to
have
it
.
then
they
do
not
want
to
.
then
the
war
ensue
between
the
color
and
non-colored
.
this
be
all
string
out
over
two
hour
,
which
be
way
too
long
.
some
movie
need
a
lot
of
time
.
save
private
ryan
be
a
little
bit
under
three
hour
long
and
i
think
it
could
have
use
more
time
.
this
film
be
only
two
hour
long
,
and
seem
much
longer
.
length
be
everything
in
film
.
if
you
can
nail
down
the
perfect
timing
and
pace
,
you
can
win
half
the
battle
.
pleasantville
can
move
at
a
good
pace
at
time
,
but
it
be
not
consistent
enough
.
overall
,
pleasantville
be
a
very
pleasant
and
provocative
departure
from
the
predictability
of
most
film
these
day
.
i
go
in
expect
a
light-hearted
film
about
change
.
i
leave
learn
a
important
lesson
about
racism
and
the
way
thing
change
.
luckily
,
pleasantville
teach
this
lesson
in
such
a
way
to
make
it
appeal
to
all
audience
.
only
if
it
could
have
do
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
.
