''
be
there
more
to

''
obviously
,
the
film
's
creator
and
star
ben

ask
a
similar
question
when
craft
a
feature-length
movie
out
of
he
hilarious
vh1\/vogue
fashion
award
short-film
subject
:
can
there
be
more
to
this
film
than
be
really
really
really
silly
?
no
,
of
course
not
,
and
it
never
aspire
to
be
anything
more
.
much
like
derek
,
zoolander
be
a
sweet
simpleton
of
a
movie
.
it
be
not
complex
in
either
its
social
commentary

its
comedy
,
and
it
never
produce
any
gut-busting
laugh
-lrb-
except
maybe
a
scene
when

a
riotously
funny

but
it
have
a
satisfying
handful
of

chuckle
,
wild
character

and
mildly
harsh
potshot
at

better
yet
,
this

of

original
three-minute
skit

out
to
a

95
minute
--
just
enough
time
to
string
together
its
goofball
plot
without

the
gag

much
like

,

jerry
stiller
--
ben
's
dad
who
be
best
remember
as
frank
costanza
of
seinfeld
--
make
a
priceless
turn
as
derek
's
slimy
agent
maury
ballstein
.
even
ben
stiller
show
alum
andy
dick
show
up
as
a
deranged
,
large-assed
masseuse
.
as
for
ben
stiller
,
it
seem
he
derek
have
one
gag
:
he
be
stupid
,
which
play
out
in
some
uproarious
one-liner
.
unfortunately
,
taylor
seem
out
of
place
and
out
of
she
league
here
.
maybe
it
be
just
because
i
can
not
stop
see
she
as
marcium
brady
-lrb-
who
she
play
in
both
brady
movie
-rrb-
,
make
she
unbelievable
as
a
dowdy
,
brainy
plain
jane
who
have
not
have
sex
in
two
year
.
she
leave
I
pine
for
the
cynicism
of
janeane
garofolo
,
who
would
have
add
real
comic
substance
to
the
flimsy
role
.
while
zoolander
be
hardly
highbrow
,
its
screwball
humor
be
welcome
during
these
try
time
,
especially
consider
the
gross
lack
of
decent
pickings
in
the
theater
these
day
.
zoolander
's
no
masterpiece
,
but
a
very
worthy
distraction
.
