once
again
,
the
battle
be
dreamwork
versus
disney
:
earlier
this
year
,
the
mammoth
company
fight
to
the
death
with
they
end-of-the-world
asteroid
flick
,
deep
impact
and
armageddon
.
here
we
be
now
,
just
a
few
month
later
,
and
they
be
at
it
again
with
duel
bug
movie
,
antz
and
a
bug
's
life
.
what
i
find
so
astonishing
be
that
both
pair
of
movie
be
so
inherently
similar
in
both
story
and
execution
.
i
mean
,
come
on
--
what
be
the
chance
of
two
studio
both
decide
to
bring
out
computer-animated
film
about
bug
?
as
be
the
case
with
the
meteor
movie
,
disney
have
come
out
on
top
:
though
antz
be
a
likable
movie
,
a
bug
's
life
be
far
superior
.
in
fact
,
this
movie
make
I
realize
what
be
wrong
with
antz
:
i
become
immerse
in
the
world
of
a
bug
's
life
,
while
antz
just
make
I
scrutinize
everything
.
but
it
be
not
really
fair
to
base
a
entire
review
on
a
comparison
.
a
bug
's
life
be
a
remarkable
film
in
its
own
right
,
and
deserve
to
be
see
apart
from
any
other
computer-animated
film
about
bug
.
in
fact
,
it
be
one
of
the
best
film
this
year
:
it
be
smart
,
subtle
,
and
funny
,
but
it
be
also
perfect
family
entertainment
and
relentlessly
entertaining
.
i
have
not
have
such
a
good
time
at
the
movie
in
month
.
it

the
story
of

flick
do
not
know
they
be
actor
,
and
they
do
not
know
that
flick
need
they
to
kill
a
bunch
of
grasshopper
,
so
they
return
to
the
colony
with
flick
and
find
themselves
in
a
unusual
position
.
the
most
obvious
element
of
a
bug
's
life
be
the
quality
of
animation
.
create
by
pixar
,
the
same
people
who
bring
we
toy
story
,
a
bug
's
life
have
some
of
the
most
amazing
visual
i
have
ever
see
.
the
bug
seem
to
inhabit
a
three-dimensional
space
,
and
occasionally
there
will
be
a
shot
that
be
indistinguishable
from
live
action
.
this
be
a
lush
,
colorful
world
,
full
of
life
and
imagination
:
the
way
the
animator
insert
the
thing
all
of
we
see
in
we
daily
life
-lrb-
match
,
bottlecap
,
tin
can
,
etc
.
-rrb-
and
make
they
active
object
in
the
bug
'
world
be
innovative
.
the
film
be
also
mercilessly
exciting
,
particularly
in
a
superbly-staged
scene
involve
we
hero
'
escape
from
a
bird
-lrb-
a
little
bird
never
seem
so
huge
and
threatening
-rrb-
.
but
the
maker
of
a
bug
's
life
know
where
the
importance
lie
:
story
and
character
.
flick
,
with
solid
voice
work
from
foley
,
be
a
great
guy
to
lead
the
story
.
but
the
real
treat
come
with
the
circus
bug
;
they
be
such
a
likable
group
of
character
--
the
standout
be
the
stick
-lrb-
hyde-pierce
be
so
good
-rrb-
,
franci
the
ladybug
,
and
the
big
fat
caterpillar
.
all
of
these
bug
have
more
than
a
token
personality
,
which
make
the
suspenseful
scene
work
because
we
care
about
the
bug
,
and
it
also
keep
the
tear-jerking
scene
from
seem
obligatory
.
in
my
review
of
antz
,
i
say
that
the
film
be
a
clever
cop-out
because
it
present
a
bunch
of
little
human
react
to
a
ant-like
existence
.
in
concept
,
a
bug
's
life
be
basically
the
same
movie
,
except
that
i
be
never
give
enough
time
to
find
thing
that
i
do
not
like
about
it
.
with
such
strong
work
in
both
animation
and
script
,
a
bug
's
life
be
nothing
but
a
joy
to
sit
through
.
it
really
be
too
bad
that
it
have
to
come
out
so
close
to
that
other
bug
movie
,
but
a
bug
's
life
be
so
good
that
i
be
sure
it
will
find
its
audience
.
after
a
slew
of
endlessly
violent
and
cynical
movie
,
it
be
downright
refreshing
to
sit
through
a
innocent
picture
like
this
and
laugh
without
feel
guilty
.
