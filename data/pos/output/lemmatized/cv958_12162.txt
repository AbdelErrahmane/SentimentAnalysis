my
only
previous
experience
with

be
with
the
musical
-lrb-

i
be

many
other

i
be
dismayed
to

selflessly
die
in
the

unspoken

here
she
be
only

see
as

she
presence
would
have
add
some
much-needed
conflict
and
emotional
heft
to
the
youthful
romance
,
but
i
suppose
August

yglesias
feel
one
tragic
heroine
-lrb-
fantine

be
enough
.
even
so
,
as

creep
into

blockbuster

,
les
miserables
be
a
thoughtful
,
well-made
,
entertaining
film
,
one
that
will
sate
moviegoer
hungry
for
a
dose
of
drama
before
