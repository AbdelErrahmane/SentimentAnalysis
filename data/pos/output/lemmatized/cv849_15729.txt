and
he
have
good
reason
to

however
,

deal
to

,
he
agree
.
death
,
under
the
human
name
of
''
joe
black
''
,
get
to
experience
life
as
a
complete
innocent
.
he
never
before
have
experience
the
simple
pleasure
of
a
springy
matter
or
peanut
butter
.
and
he
be
not
quite
compare
for
the
more
complex
pleasure
when
he
and
susan
fall
in
love
.
but
,
be
they
affair
doom
to
a
early
demise
?
at
nearly
three
hour
in
length
,
meet
joe
black
be
a
little
bit
on
the
leisurely
side
,
though
it
never
get
boringly
lengthy
.
instead
,
the
film
get
a
chance
to
develop
some
nicely
textured
character
and
situation
.
you
get
to
soak
in
and
enjoy
the
atmosphere
,
rather
than
be
hurriedly
rush
through
it
.
the
romantic
angle
work
well
,
though
,
surprisingly
,
the
interaction
between
joe
black
and
william
parrish
be
more
interesting
than
those
with
he
daughter
.
this
be
most
likely
due
to
anthony
hopkin
,
who
once
again
display
he
superb
act
skill
.
william
be
a
desperate
man
who
have
have
a
seemingly
ideal
life
,
and
do
not
want
to
let
it
go
.
by
contrast
,
claire
forlanus
be
merely
the
romantic
interest
.
she
get
to
show
joe
the
rope
of
love
,
but
be
hardly
as
interesting
a
character
.
as
joe
black
,
brad
pitt
seem
a
bit
stilted
.
grant
,
he
be
suppose
to
be
out-of-place
,
but
the
overly
formal
technique
use
by
pitt
begin
to
distract
from
the
role
.
still
,
he
be
able
to
hold
he
own
,
and
over
the
course
of
the
three
hour
,
he
character
begin
to
grow
on
you
.
the
main
character
who
seem
out
of
place
here
be
draw
-lrb-
jake
weber
-rrb-
,
a
ambitious
executive
in
william
'
company
who
be
joe
black
's
main
rival
for
susan
's
affection
.
weber
play
the
character
with
a
hammy
relish
reminiscent
of
snidley
whiplash
.
this
cartoonish
foil
a
aberration
in
a
film
fill
many
more
dimensional
character
.
the
supernatural
element
of
the
film
be
handle
murkily
,
but
never
distractingly
so
.
we
never
learn
what
be
the
exact
nature
of
death
,
or
why
he
be
never
do
something
like
this
before
.
it
actually
get
a
bit
creepy
when
death
talk
to
the
die
in
they
own
voices\/accents
.
-lrb-
he
initial
conversation
with
hopkin
sound
shockingly
like
hannibal
lecter
...
-rrb-
and
the
ultimate
resolution
to
one
of
the
film
's
supernatural
problem
seem
,
well
,
somewhat
superficial
.
still
,
even
with
the
film
's
length
,
it
be
a
pleasant
time
at
the
movie
,
something
you
would
not
necessarily
expect
from
a
film
about
death
...
but
one
which
meet
joe
black
deliver
anyhow
.
