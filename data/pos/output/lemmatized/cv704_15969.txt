with
the
sudden
liberal
emergence
of
personal
privacy
abound
in
the
news
lately
,
what
with
that
whole
clinton
thing
go
on
-lrb-
you
know
,
100
million
buck
to
discover
the
president
get
boink
by
a
intern
-
oh
,
please
,
government
,
waste
my
tax
just
a
bit
more
,
would
you
?
-rrb-
,
it
be
about
time
tony
scott
helm
the
newest
action
pic
disguise
as
a
important
if
not
slightly
ignorant
social
statement
.
with
this
and
''
crimson
tide
,
''
he
be
create
two
successfully
chilly
film
that
be
interesting
,
exciting
,
even
pretty
smart
,
but
never
totally
riveting
as
cinema
,
and
the
problem
i
think
with
each
of
these
film
be
that
each
film
be
too
obsess
with
its
message
to
ever
be
really
satisfying
,
and
too
obsess
with
look
all
cut
edge
to
ever
be
totally
smart
.
that
film
deal
with
a
civil
war
inside
a
nuclear
submarine
over
whether
or
not
to
follow
rule
or
question
they
,
and
be
appropriately
scary
and
all
,
but
never
totally
thrilling
or
overly
brilliant
.
''
enemy
of
the
state
''
be
the
same
way
:
it
be
engross
for
its
entire
run
time
,
and
it
be
scary
the
way
that
it
show
a
man
's
decent
into
kafkaism
,
but
it
be
too
technical
.
it
be
too
cold
and
not
as
fascinating
or
exciting
as
it
could
be
.
it
cast
will
smith
,
one
of
the
better
big
budget
lead
man
in
movie
these
day
because
he
be
charming
and
witty
and
never
uninteresting
,
and
hope
that
he
charisma
can
make
up
for
he
character
not
be
well
develop
enough
to
really
be
a
person
.
i
hate
to
do
this
,
but
last
year
's
film
''
the
game
''
get
it
damn
perfect
:
it
cast
michael
dougla
as
a
deeply
flawed
human
being
,
a
man
who
be
cold
and
have
cut
off
everyone
from
he
life
,
and
then
pull
everything
he
think
he
have
as
a
security
blanket
away
from
he
and
watch
what
happen
.
the
result
be
not
only
a
film
that
be
exciting
and
chilling
,
but
also
the
best
mindfuck
of
the
entire
year
.
not
that
i
want
every
kafkaesque
film
to
be
''
the
game
''
-lrb-
this
year
's
''
the
spanish
prisoner
''
succeed
with
less
thrill
and
chill
-rrb-
,
but
it
should
be
a
example
of
what
work
and
what
do
not
.
will
smith
's
character
be
,
frankly
,
too
perfect
,
at
least
too
movie
perfect
.
he
have
a
affair
with
another
woman
-lrb-
lisa
bonet
,
ha
ha
-rrb-
,
but
he
relationship
with
he
wife
-lrb-
regina
king
-rrb-
be
basically
fine
regardless
.
he
have
a
kid
,
and
he
be
rake
in
money
as
a
lawyer
,
albeit
a
very
good
and
reasonably
moral
one
.
so
he
generally
do
not
have
any
real
problem
as
a
human
being
,
and
be
therefore
boring
...
except
that
he
be
play
by
will
smith
,
who
embody
he
with
about
as
much
will
smith
charm
as
he
can
without
enter
''
id4
''
\/
''
man
in
black
''
territory
.
he
be
a
good
dramatic
actor
-lrb-
just
see
the
first
half
hour
of
''
six
degree
of
separation
''
for
proof
of
this
,
not
that
he
be
not
great
the
whole
time
-rrb-
,
and
here
,
he
make
he
character
likable
and
sympathetic
without
any
real
strain
on
he
character
,
which
make
the
film
lack
any
real
deep
interesting
quality
.
smith
become
involve
in
a
mass
conspiracy
involve
the
assasination
of
a
senator
oppose
to
a
government
law
that
would
create
world
surveillance
,
extinguish
privacy
as
we
know
it
from
the
world
,
under
the
pretense
that
it
would
make
crime
easier
to
control
,
when
he
be
pass
a
disk
of
the
event
catch
on
tape
by
a
outside
party
-lrb-
a
nature
observer
play
by
,
uh
,
jason
lee
-rrb-
.
the
government
want
the
disk
,
and
be
prepare
to
destroy
he
life
to
get
it
.
as
smith
's
plight
be
dramatize
,
we
be
introduce
to
the
mastermind
who
surveillance
he
,
sit
in
van
disguise
as
other
business
,
stare
at
computer
and
pull
out
trick
faster
than
a
speeding
bullet
.
these
guy
-lrb-
play
by
jack
black
,
jamie
kennedy
,
and
seth
green
-rrb-
be
the
most
interesting
part
of
this
film
because
they
be
,
well
,
fascinating
:
they
be
do
they
job
,
which
be
evil
,
but
the
film
do
not
view
they
as
such
,
and
they
almost
become
we
friend
.
we
like
these
guy
for
the
sole
reason
that
the
film
do
not
automatically
judge
they
as
the
villain
.
they
be
also
scary
because
we
get
the
idea
that
they
be
not
fully
aware
of
the
impact
they
job
have
on
the
world
.
it
be
as
if
they
be
obsess
with
they
job
,
not
because
they
be
evil
,
but
because
,
hey
,
it
be
a
fun
job
,
and
no
one
else
can
do
it
like
they
.
unfortunately
,
this
also
backfire
a
bit
on
the
film
:
instead
of
be
the
flashlight
in
the
darkened
room
that
''
the
game
''
be
,
you
see
everything
,
and
be
thus
not
as
freak
out
because
you
know
what
be
go
on
.
sure
,
you
be
chill
,
but
you
be
not
exacty
freak
out
by
what
be
go
on
.
but
what
do
you
expect
from
tony
scott
,
the
man
who
never
meet
a
five-second
piece
of
film
he
ever
like
.
he
be
a
not-bad
director
because
,
hell
,
he
be
always
interesting
to
watch
-lrb-
if
not
occasionally
moronic
-
exhibit
a
:
''
day
of
thunder
''
-rrb-
,
but
the
reason
he
be
not
great
be
because
he
be
too
technical
and
calculate
.
he
shot
be
perfectly
execute
,
and
leave
nothing
to
the
imagination
,
and
they
be
always
make
sure
you
be
pay
attention
.
this
be
incredibly
annoying
,
and
it
reduce
''
enemy
of
the
state
''
to
a
mechanical
mishmash
of
flashy
image
that
never
expand
the
mind
at
any
great
depths
,
but
still
manage
to
entertain
without
any
real
problem
.
despite
never
actually
become
great
,
it
be
never
actually
boring
and
it
be
always
intriguing
.
watch
the
government
set-up
smith
be
endlessly
fascinating
,
and
since
we
care
about
smith
's
likeable
protagonist
,
we
be
set-up
for
a
good
two
hour
worth
of
tom
clancy-esque
entertainment
.
add
the
best
big
cast
this
side
of
the
annual
woody
allen
film
-lrb-
everyone
from
gabriel
byrne
to
dan
butler
pop
up
for
cameo
-rrb-
,
and
you
have
get
a
good
old
fashion
escapist
drama
which
do
all
the
think
for
you
so
that
you
never
have
to
actually
question
the
debate
over
personal
privacy
and
so
you
can
follow
will
smith
's
plight
without
a
minute
's
worth
of
boredom
.
