robert
redford
's
a
river
run
through
it
be
not
a
film
i
watch
often
.
it
be
a
masterpiece
--
one
of
the
better
film
of
recent
year
.
until
1994
,
it
be
my
second
favorite
film
of
all
time
.
the
act
and
direction
be
top-notch
--
never
sappy
,
always
touch
.
a
friend
of
mine
once
report
that
he
avoid
it
because
''
i
be
afraid
it
would
just
be
really
politically
correct
,
and
tick
I
off
.
''
all
i
could
do
be
tell
he
to
go
in
unbiased
,
and
enjoy
.
it
be
one
of
the
few
movie
that
have
completely
reduce
I
to
tear
.
but
certain
memory
should
not
often
be
rerelease
--
in
the
last
few
shot
,
you
have
to
cry
.
upon
my
first
viewing
i
leave
bawl
.
it
be
not
flawless
--
but
it
be
so
very
good
,
that
you
can
not
help
but
be
effect
.
the
opening
be
dangerously
nolstalgic
and
sentimental
--
watch
these
shot
of
people
who
have
be
dead
so
long
,
give
you
a
feeling
of
perspective
and
history
observation
that
you
will
find
in
very
few
other
film
.
martin
scorsese
once
describe
the
movie
as
a
dream
state
--
like
take
dope
,
and
immerse
yourself
in
a
alternative
world
.
that
be
what
a
river
run
through
it
do
.
it
exploit
the
unique
power
of
cinema
to
engross
you
and
help
to
forget
you
real
self
.
both
time
i
have
see
it
,
its
be
hard
-lrb-
again
to
quote
scorsese
-rrb-
wake
up
.
but
the
dream
be
lovely
.
