he
personal
life
,
on
the
other
hand
,
be
clutter
with

in
fact
,
arthur

by
far
the
blandest

film
,
despite
a
charismatic
performance
by
hayashus
-lrb-
the
san
francisco-based
actor
whose
film
include
chan

and
the
karate
kid
ii
-rrb-
.
it
be
the
auxiliary
character
who
give

unique
spark
.

take
the
part
and
run
with
it
,
almost
steal

movie
in
the
process
.
she
play

as
a
drive
woman
,
determine
to
overcome
she
genetic
heritage
by
immerse

house
.
arthur
's
11-year-old
son
,
jimmy
,
play
by
the
amazingly
adorable
david
chan
,
be
--
horror
of
horror
--
bad
at
math
!
he
find
it
impossible
to
meet
he
father
's
lofty
expectation
.
the
various
people
in
arthur
's
life
come
together
to
form
a
rich
tapestry
of
humanity
.
like
wang
's
earlier
film
,
a
great
wall
-lrb-
about
a
san
francisco
family
visit
relative
in
china
-rrb-
,
the
laserman
revolve
around
cultural
difference
.
every
character
in
the
film
be
,
in
some
way
or
another
,
try
to
find
he
identity
--
struggle
to
negotiate
a
balance
between
he
native
culture
and
the
american
way
.
the
movie
also
offer
a
provocative
look
at
technology
.
wang
appear
in
the
movie
as
lieutenant
lu
,
a
detective
who
be
feed
up
with
machine
,
even
though
he
rely
on
they
to
do
he
job
.
the
film
view
technology
with
a
wary
eye
,
acknowledge
its
necessity
while
at
the
same
time
realize
its
potential
danger
.
wang
raise
the
time-honored
question
of
whether
scientist
should
be
hold
responsible
for
they
invention
.
be
einstein
responsible
for
the
a-bomb
?
be
arthur
weiss
responsible
for
he
laser
?
the
movie
pit
spirituality
against
technology
,
man
against
machine
,
and
the
result
be
a
draw
.
accord
to
the
film
,
technology
have
its
place
,
but
we
must
employ
it
with
great
forethought
and
caution
.
ironically
,
by
its
very
nature
,
the
laserman
be
a
triumph
of
technology
--
the
technology
of
filmmaking
.
wang
's
direction
be
exquisite
,
especially
during
the
tense
finale
in
which
the
director
frantically
cross-cut
between
the
various
subplot
,
perhaps
in
homage
to
d
.
w
.
griffith
.
cinematographer
ernest
dickerson
,
who
have
work
on
all
of
spike
lee
's
film
,
give
the
laserman
a
distinctive
,
artistic
look
.
mason
daring
's
score
,
which
include
a
send-up
of
bach
,
be
right
on
target
.
the
laserman
be
a
ambitious
endeavor
,
which
be
to
be
applaud
,
but
it
be
sometimes
ambitious
to
a
fault
.
wang
serve
up
so
many
slice
of
life
in
the
film
that
it
be
hard
to
digest
they
all
.
for
instance
,
one
character
-lrb-
arthur
's
sister
-rrb-
have
negligible
screen
time
,
and
consequently
we
just
do
not
care
about
she
marital
problem
.
in
weave
he
web
,
wang
have
include
a
few
too
many
strand
.
overall
,
however
,
the
laserman
be
a
charmingly
eclectic
concoction
.
on
the
surface
,
the
film
be
a
light
and
bouncy
comedy-thriller
,
overflow
with
whimsical
humor
and
visual
style
.
the
heavier
issue
emerge
only
when
you
take
a
deeper
look
at
the
film
.
you
can
ponder
the
moral
question
or
you
can
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
absurdity
of
life
in
china
town
.
