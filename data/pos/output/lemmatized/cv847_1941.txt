bruce
lee
be
a
bigger-than-life
martial
artist
-lrb-
and
-rrb-
actor
.
bruce
's
unique
character
-lrb-
i
.
e
.
,
self-produced
sound
effect
,
etc
.
-rrb-
and
seemingly
perfect
martial
art
and
physique
be
all
well
portray
by
the
actor
,
jame
lee
.
the
story
be
tell
from
he
wife
linda
's
point
of
view
where
she
put
a
lot
of
family
and
practical
side
of
bruce
lee
's
life
.
however
,
you
can
not
help
but
like
,
whenever
the
fight
scene
be
on
,
what
he
can
do
with
he
body
and
that
familiar
bruce
attitude
and
character

i
also
like
the
little
bit
of
insight
scene
about
bruce
lee
's
life
before
he
become
famous
:
scene
like
bruce
practice
pronunciation
of
english
.
it
seem
as
if
he
be
no
better
than
anybody
else
.
scene
like
bruce
deliver
chinese
food
as
a
delivery
boy
rid
a
bike
through
the
american
college
look
at
the
-lrb-
all-white
-rrb-
student
,
cheerleader
,
and
athlete
.
it
seem
he
too
wish
for
the
american
dream
and
hope
.
in
conclusion
,
the
movie
be
well
make
,
it
produce
a
realization
of
who
bruce
lee
be
,
and
actor
jame
lee
be
so
much
like
bruce
you
have
to
remind
yourself
that
he
be
just
a
actor
.
and
the
fight
scene
be
all
excellent
.
so
go
see
it
and
enjoy
the
movie
.
p
.
s
.
if
you
have
see
the
movie
unforgiven
by
clint
eastwood
,
then
the
feeling
leave
after
dragon
be
very
much
like
the
feeling
you
get
after
the
unforgiven
.
