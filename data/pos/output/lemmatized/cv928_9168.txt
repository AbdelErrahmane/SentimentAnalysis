i
swear
i
have
see
the
edge
before
.
in
fact
,
it
remind
I
of
the
bear
,
the
river
wild
,
and
other
various
film
mix
into
a
entirely
different
film
.
however
,
the
edge
have
do
something
that
most
action
film
should
do
,
and
that
be
add
heart
and
character
we
like
to
the
plot
.
in
do
so
,
the
edge
draw
many
more
suspenseful
moment
out
of
cliched
scene
than
,
say
,
the
peacemaker
.
unfortunately
,
because
of
those
overused
moment
,
we
can
pretty
much
guess
the
outcome
of
the
film
.
but
leave
it
to
screenwriter
david
mamet
to
add
humor
and
a
few
surprise
to
mess
with
you
head
.
one
surprise
,
in
particular
,
leave
I
smile
just
because
mamet
actually
have
the
gut
to
add
it
to
he
script
.
action
film
be
a
dime
a
dozen
in
hollywood
,
and
while
they
be
somewhat
successful
at
entertain
we
,
they
lack
the
one
thing
which
would
make
they
a
more
respected
genre
:
intelligence
.
even
horror
film
have
learn
this
,
a
genre
which
be
probably
the
least
respect
of
they
all
.
the
river
wild
be
one
of
the
best
action\/suspense
film
i
have
see
from
the
90
.
the
intelligence
of
the
screenplay
,
and
the
suspense
draw
from
the
realistic
character
be
nearly
unmatched
to
this
day
.
the
edge
have
the
intelligence
and
smart
character
,
but
this
time
the
lack
of
originality
be
the
downfall
.
i
must
admit
that
it
be
very
suspenseful
,
and
have
a
original
third
half
,
but
the
first
hour
and
a
half
be
riddled
with
cliche
and
plot
hole
.
this
be
a
example
of
the
final
act
save
the
film
,
instead
of
the
other
way
around
-lrb-
as
in
the
lost
world
-rrb-
.
if
only
the
screenplay
have
maintain
the
final
thirty
minute
'
intensity
,
it
could
have
become
a
great
action
film
-lrb-
and
i
use
the
term
loosely
-rrb-
.
the
edge
be
pretty
much
a
survival-of-the-fittest
film
.
but
take
scream
's
lead
,
the
edge
make
fun
of
the
genre
's
cliche
,
and
then
use
they
-lrb-
though
not
quite
as
effectively
-rrb-
.
charle
morse
-lrb-
anthony
hopkin
-rrb-
be
the
main
character
,
a
rich
and
very
intelligent
man
who
wonder
what
the
accumulation
of
all
this
knowledge
have
bring
to
he
.
for
once
,
we
do
not
immediately
care
for
the
main
character
.
instead
,
we
like
bob
-lrb-
alec
baldwin
-rrb-
,
a
photographer
who
be
go
to
take
picture
of
charle
'
wife
,
mickey
-lrb-
elle
macpherson
-rrb-
,
out
in
the
wilderness
.
they
board
a
plane
and
head
to
a
cabin
somewhere
in
the
arctic
.
charle
'
birthday
be
the
same
day
,
and
he
receive
a
gold
watch
from
he
wife
,
and
a
pocket
knife
from
bob
.
as
action
film
go
,
these
item
do
have
importance
to
the
rest
of
the
story
,
but
quite
a
bit
more
than
we
first
expect
.
soon
,
however
,
bob
want
to
find
a
native
to
shoot
picture
of
because
of
he
''
personality
.
''
charle
,
bob
,
bob
's
assistant
steve
-lrb-
harold
perrineau
-rrb-
,
and
the
pilot
head
off
to
find
he
,
and
as
show
in
the
preview
,
hit
a
flock
of
bird
fly
south
for
the
winter
.
down
the
plane
go
,
the
pilot
be
kill
,
and
the
three
be
leave
to
survive
in
the
wilderness
.
director
lee
tamahorus
be
aware
of
the
silly
plot
which
be
about
to
follow
,
and
therefore
have
to
create
original
way
to
approach
the
situation
.
he
succeed
often
enough
for
we
to
enjoy
the
film
.
take
,
for
instance
,
the
entire
man-hunting
bear
plot
.
this
have
be
do
many
time
in
film
with
different
animal
,
and
even
bear
.
but
give
the
charle
'
intelligence
,
and
bob
's
uncertainty
,
many
of
the
cliche
be
give
fresh
twist
.
even
charle
himself
seem
to
have
see
these
action
film
before
.
my
favorite
line
of
the
film
come
from
charle
:
''
most
people
die
in
the
wilderness
because
they
do
not
do
the
one
thing
that
could
save
they
life
...
think
.
''
despite
the
predictability
of
the
main
plot
,
a
subplot
develop
late
in
the
film
which
take
I
by
surprise
,
and
make
I
smile
when
i
realize
that
everything
be
not
as
it
seem
anymore
.
i
have
to
write
cautiously
as
to
not
reveal
this
surprise
,
so
instead
i
will
avoid
it
entirely
.
the
first
two-third
of
the
edge
have
many
humorous
moment
to
push
it
along
,
and
some
of
charle
'
survival
technique
seem
possible
,
even
make
fire
from
ice
.
tamahorus
be
able
to
create
a
lot
of
suspense
from
the
stalk
bear
,
but
whenever
the
bear
be
present
,
the
character
lose
all
sensibility
.
i
have
always
wonder
why
character
in
film
walk
over
a
log
to
get
across
water
.
why
not
do
what
a
intelligent
person
would
and
crawl
across
?
i
guess
get
chase
by
a
bear
make
you
thought
process
turn
off
for
a
while
.
thankfully
,
we
already
have
begin
to
care
for
the
character
,
and
so
we
let
this
small
detail
slide
.
but
some
of
the
technical
detail
be
awkward
,
such
as
the
nice
stitching
do
on
the
fur
coat
that
charle
and
bob
make
-lrb-
where
do
they
get
thread
and
needle
?
-rrb-
.
the
acting
of
the
film
be
highly
above
average
for
a
film
of
this
nature
,
and
border
on
phenomenal
.
anthony
hopkin
give
a
terrific
performance
,
create
he
most
likeable
and
layered
character
since
remains
of
the
day
.
hopkin
usually
bring
greatness
to
he
role
,
but
here
he
exceed
at
gain
the
audience
'
sympathy
,
something
he
definitely
do
not
do
in
silence
of
the
lamb
.
alec
baldwin
give
one
of
he
best
performance
i
have
ever
see
-lrb-
it
sure
be
better
from
he
fair
game
-rrb-
.
baldwin
can
be
a
good
or
a
bad
character
,
and
here
he
succeed
at
both
in
a
way
.
you
can
never
quite
guess
if
he
be
a
nice
or
a
vllainous
character
until
the
end
,
and
baldwin
be
able
to
handle
the
double-natured
photographer
.
elle
macpherson
give
a
good
performance
,
albeit
slight
.
she
be
not
in
the
film
all
that
much
,
but
for
the
scene
she
do
have
,
she
handle
as
a
actress
,
not
as
a
model
.
harold
perrineau
be
a
good
actor
,
and
he
scene
be
nice
and
underplayed
.
he
be
eliminate
early
,
and
i
reveal
nothing
by
say
this
because
it
be
inevitable
and
predictable
.
the
edge
be
rate
r
for
graphic
violence
,
some
gore
,
and
language
.
some
of
the
violence
be
a
little
too
disturbing
,
even
for
I
.
this
film
be
a
nice
change
from
the
mindless
action
most
of
we
be
use
to
,
but
too
many
cliche
bog
it
down
.
director
tamahorus
have
create
a
very
smooth
and
suspenseful
action
film
out
of
recycled
part
.
david
mamet
's
script
,
though
,
have
a
lot
of
humor
to
keep
the
first
hour
afloat
,
and
the
acting
be
solid
.
the
best
thing
about
the
script
be
the
end
which
do
not
end
with
the
normal
high-strung
action
sequence
,
but
with
a
small
detail
involve
a
certain
gift
.
it
be
a
nice
touch
consider
what
we
have
have
to
go
through
with
the
bear
.
and
by
the
way
,
most
people
laugh
when
the
film
fade
to
black
due
to
a
large
credit
to
bart
the
bear
.
way
to
go
