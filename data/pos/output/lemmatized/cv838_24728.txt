talented
young
screenwriter
jeffrey
reddick
offer
a
fresh
variation
on
a
familiar
formulum

we
have
see
hundred
of

where
a
group
of

be
murder
one-by-one
by

most
of
that
premise

we
that
death
be
everywhere
,
can
come
at
anytime

doom
:
john
denver
's
''
rocky
mountain

,
''
which
be
play
several
time
in

constantly
threaten

right
now
in

play
the
somewhat
dim
billy

and
provide
a
need
counterpoint
to
the
intensity
of
alex
and
carter
.
tony
todd

one-scene
cameo
be
delicious

all
too
brief
