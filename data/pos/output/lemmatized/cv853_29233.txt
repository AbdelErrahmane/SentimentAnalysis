my
summer
be
recently
save
by
two
very
different
movie
.
on
open
night
,
i
see
american
pie
2
and
laugh
like
a
moron
.
then
a
few
night
later
,
i
watch
and
thoroughly
enjoy
joel
hershman
's
greenfinger
even
though
it
do
not
feature
a
trip
to
band
camp
,
girl-on-girl
action
,
or
seann
william
scott
.
however
,
i
feel
just
as
good
leave
american
pie
2
as
i
do
after
leave
greenfinger
,
which
tell
the
offbeat
tale
of
british
murderer
colin
brigg
-lrb-
clive
owen
of
croupier
-rrb-
.
after
spend
roughly
half
of
he
life
behind
bar
,
he
be
transfer
to
a
more
lenient
facility
,
edgefield
.
the
picaresque
,
rustic
prison
allow
its
inmate
to
learn
a
trade
,
while
enjoy
accommodation
generally
find
at
most
college
.
at
first
,
brigg
do
not
want
to
be
there
.
he
be
use
to
live
as
a
prisoner
and
want
to
be
leave
alone
.
however
,
he
ail
roommate
,
fergus
-lrb-
david
kelly
of
wake
ned
devine
-rrb-
,
wear
brigg
down
through
he
benign
nature
.
the
two
become
friend
,
with
fergus
give
colin
a
packet
of
violet
seed
as
a
christmas
gift
.
brigg
be
astonish
when
the
violet
grow
in
the
limestone
soil
,
and
begin
a
fight
with
three
other
prisoner
when
a
errant
soccer
ball
smash
he
beloved
flower
.
after
the
prison
's
governor
-lrb-
warren
clarke
-rrb-
reprimand
they
,
he
be
awed
at
what
brigg
have
accomplish
.
and
he
be
strike
by
a
idea
--
brigg
,
fergus
and
the
other
man
will
grow
a
garden
on
the
prison
's
grounds
.
greenfinger
,
which
be
''
inspire
by
actual
event
,
''
become
a
bit
like
a
sport
movie
after
that
.
despite
they
difference
,
the
man
come
together
and
through
hard
work
and
love
earn
a
spot
at
the
big
game
--
in
this
case
a
prestigious
garden
show
.
one
renegade
,
in
this
case
,
brigg
,
will
prove
to
have
talent
.
of
course
,
love
will
also
rear
its
head
-lrb-
no
,
not
''
prison
love
''
-rrb-
.
to
hershman
's
credit
,
he
do
not
pump
up
the
drama
or
try
for
cheap
laugh
,
like
last
year
's
lame
marijuana
comedy
save
grace
.
i
have
to
keep
pinch
myself
when
i
do
not
see
a
single
scene
of
a
hardened
con
sneeze
over
a
pot
of
pansy
,
or
the
man
give
high-fives
over
a
particularly
stunning
batch
of
wildflower
.
the
movie
deal
with
people
and
score
on
that
concept
.
it
be
wonderful
see
brigg
turn
from
a
bitter
prisoner
to
a
man
who
care
again
.
give
credit
to
owen
for
keep
he
cool
in
a
part
that
beg
for
overact
.
he
speech
to
the
parole
board
about
be
reborn
through
gardening
be
the
best
scene
of
its
kind
since
morgan
freeman
's
last
stand
in
the
shawshank
redemption
.
owen
's
bedside
scene
with
kelly
,
who
lend
the
film
a
human
touch
,
be
a
marvel
to
behold
,
emotionally
grip
without
be
sappy
.
write
by
hershman
,
greenfinger
contain
plenty
of
laugh
.
most
come
courtesy
of
helen
mirren
,
who
shine
as
the
world-class
gardener
who
work
with
the
inmate
but
fear
for
she
daughter
primrose
-lrb-
natasha
little
-rrb-
when
she
start
date
brigg
.
the
mother
can
not
believe
what
he
'll
do
if
she
daughter
''
burn
the
Sunday
roast
.
''
nothing
be
force
in
greenfinger
.
the
funny
line
come
forth
naturally
in
conversation
and
not
from
punch
line
.
primrose
and
brigg
'
relationship
take
awkward
step
.
even
when
brigg
decide
to
go
back
to
edgefield
,
it
be
do
for
reason
of
loyalty
,
not
because
the
movie
require
he
to
do
so
.
after
grimace
through
the
force
screwball
antic
of
movie
like
america
's
sweetheart
and
the
princess
dairy
,
it
be
a
almost
indescribable
pleasure
to
see
a
director
take
he
time
to
tell
a
story
very
well
.
