drug
,
a
world-wide
youthful
phenomenon
during
this
period

where
many
westerner
come

even
though
drug
be
illegal
there
.
but
this
be
not
show
as
one
of
she
reason
for
be
here
.
in
this
film
,
the
subject
of
drug
be
never
broach
,
only
hint
at
in
a
off-handed
but
slur
way
,
as
the
hippie
commune
be
show
in
a
negative
light
,
strum
on
they
guitar
and
brag
about
the
hit
of
acid
they
have
take
.
even
the
one
come
here
for
spiritual
reason
,
to
follow
the
mystical
sufi
,
seem
lose
follow
a
culture
that
be
far
different
from
where
they
be
come
from

the
film
be
base
on
the
novel
that
contain
the
autobiographical
experience
of
sigmund
freud
's
grand-daughter
,
esther
freud
,
who
travel
here
in
the
1960
with
she
mother
and
sister
.
it
be
write
by
the
director
's
brother
,
who
have
previously
direct
regeneration
,
the
playboy
,
and
trojan
eddie
.
the
title
of
the
film
come
from
the
squeal
giggle
that
say
hideous
kinky
give
the
little
girl
.
with
julium
strap
for
cash
and
not
receive
a
need
check
she
husband
often
forget
to
send
she
,
she
be
prevent
from
see
the
greatest
living
sufus
who
be
located
in
algerium
;
so
instead
,
she
meet
a

performer
in
the
bazaar
,

he
become
she
lover
,
take
the
place
of
she
husband
as
a
father
figure
for
the
girl
.
the
girl
readily
accept
he
,
and
there
be
no
big-to-do
make
about
they
openly
sexual
relationship
,
but
the
girl
really
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
relationship
.
it
especially
bother
bea
,
who
be
embarrass
by
she
mother
's
loose
attitude
and
want
to
go
home
.
thing
go
surprisingly
sour
when
bilal
take
they
to
stay
in
he
small
village
.
it
seem
only
that
bilal
's
charm
be
match
by
he
shiftlessness
,
as
he
have
a
wife
who
still
live
there
.
this
scene
do
not
make
too
much
sense
as
to
why
he
would
take
they
there
know
the
situation
,
unless
the
uneducated
man
be
totally
uneducated
in
the
custom
of
he
people
,
also
.
but
i
doubt
that
.
the
family
be
now
stick
without
money
in
a
backward
area
try
to
decide
what
to
do
next
,
as
they
hitch
a
ride
away
from
there
with
a
truck
driver
who
nearly
kill
they
when
he
fall
asleep
by
the
wheel
.
lucy
take
it
all
in
stride
and
have
a
good
disposition
for
travel
,
while
bea
just
want
to
go
to
a
school
and
learn
something
and
be
a
`
normal
'
girl
.
the
beauty
of
marrakech
be
match
by
the
terrific
performance
of
kate
winslet
,
as
the
film
accurately
encapsulate
the
timeless
city
and
its
bustling
street
scene
,
expansive
view
,
illustrious
mosque
,
and
grand
sunset
.
kate
enact
the
feel
of
what
it
be
like
to
be
a
westerner
,
live
out
the
countercultural
experience
while
await
to
gather
she
sensibility
again
and
be
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
go
home
the
better
off
for
she
experience
,
as
many
a
drop-out
reluctantly
have
to
do
after
they
stay
run
out
of
money
and
purpose
.
the
background
music
from
group
like
america
and
jefferson
airplane
,
provide
further
nostalgia
for
this
easy
to
look
at
and
easy
to
grasp
film
.
the
only
hope
be
that
the
two
innocent
girl
would
not
be
permanently
harm
while
on
this
sojourn
,
a
venture
that
should
be
reserve
only
for
those
of
college
age
or
older
who
choose
to
go
there
for
themselves
.
the
family
's
travel
,
which
be
on
the
edge
,
have
julium
wake
up
scream
from
dream
that
be
bleakly
haunt
;
but
,
when
she
get
up
,
all
there
be
,
be
this
splendid
emptiness
all
around
she
and
a
vacuous
life
that
be
start
to
bother
she
.
that
marrakech
be
disarmingly
gorgeous
and
that
london
be
old
hat
to
she
,
be
start
to
wear
thin
in
she
thought
.
it
will
dawn
on
she
,
when
bea
take
ill
,
as
she
reflect
on
what
the
sufi
guru
tell
she
,
whom
she
finally
meet
and
be
drive
to
tear
in
he
presence
.
he
be
the
guru
who
replace
the
one
she
want
to
see
but
who
die
before
she
get
a
chance
to
see
he
.
the
new
guru
be
ground
in
reality
,
something
she
be
not
ground
in
,
and
seem
to
tell
she
what
she
could
not
comprehend
from
anyone
else
,
even
comforting
she
,
by
tell
she
that
she
tear
be
memory
-
a
gift
from
god
.
the
film
's
weakness
be
the
empty
feeling
i
get
from
watch
the
story
unfold
in
its
risk
free
tenor
-lrb-
she
be
there
basically
to
be
just
escape
from
she
situation
-rrb-
and
how
unappealing
the
love
affair
seem
between
bilal
and
julium
.
the
storyline
about
a
helpless
single
parent
,
detract
from
the
vibrant
experience
many
other
of
she
same
baby-boom
generation
have
during
they
trip
to
morocco
,
who
be
take
in
by
the
mystical
culture
of
sufism
,
a
teaching
that
have
a
lot
to
offer
its
follower
,
contrary
to
the
impression
the
film
might
give
,
seem
to
pass
she
by
.
she
knowledge
of
that
trip
be
only
surface
deep
,
at
best
.
she
perhaps
would
have
be
better
off
not
take
the
kid
along
,
smoke
some
hashish
,
and
have
be
less
assure
of
herself
but
to
have
behave
more
like
a
hippie
and
she
would
not
have
be
so
uptight
all
the
time
and
have
some
fun
on
she
journey
.
after
all
,
the
mystical
trip
be
the
journey
.
the
film
's
strength
be
in
how
all
the
character
be
show
for
what
they
be
,
and
no
one
be
that
good
or
that
bad
,
or
judge
too
harshly
for
they
shortcoming
.
bilal
be
unreliable
but
be
capable
of
generosity
.
the
little
girl
be
precocious
but
they
be
lovable
.
julium
,
the
cornerstone
the
film
be
build
on
,
be
a
mother
who
care
about
the
child
but
do
not
know
how
to
take
care
of
they
without
unintentionally
harm
they
.
she
be
try
to
escape
from
reality
and
that
by
return
to
london
,
she
have
another
chance
to
see
if
she
can
find
the
key
to
this
world
or
whatever
world
she
be
look
for
and
should
no
longer
have
nightmare
about
where
she
be
at
.
this
be
a
very
freudian
way
to
look
at
thing
,
as
this
sudden
realization
,
that
thing
be
not
right
put
a
a
end
to
she
eastern
hippie
odyssey
,
at
least
,
for
the
time
be
.
and
,
after
all
be
say
and
do
,
who
be
to
say
if
the
child
be
also
not
better
off
for
survive
they
experience
,
just
like
she
probably
be
!
