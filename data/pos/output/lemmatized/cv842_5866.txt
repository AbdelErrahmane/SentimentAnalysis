if
beavi
and
butthead
have
a
favorite
movie
,
from
dusk
till
dawn
would
probably
be
it
.
script
by
quentin
tarantino
and
direct
by
robert
rodriguez
-lrb-
desperado
-rrb-
,
the
movie
pander
to
the
very
worst
in
sex
and
violence
--
and
be
incredibly
fun
to
watch
.
it
start
off
as
a
pulp
fiction-type
crime
story
,
with
criminal
brother
george
clooney
and
tarantino
rob
a
convenience
store
.
because
this
be
a
tarantino
movie
,
however
,
it
be
not
just
a
case
of
pull
the
gun
and
take
the
loot
,
it
be
a
case
of
a
hole
be
shoot
through
someone
's
hand
,
a
man
on
fire
jump
out
behind
the
counter
and
the
entire
store
blow
up
as
they
drive
away
.
the
opening
scene
set
the
tone
for
the
rest
of
the
movie
--
everything
overdo
and
nothing
as
it
seem
.
clooney
and
tarantino
bring
a
hostage
to
the
motel
and
then
hijack
a
rv
with
a
family
in
it
.
harvey
keitel
play
the
backslidden
ex-preacher
and
juliette
lewi
he
daughter
,
whom
register
sex-pervert
tarantino
eye
endlessly
.
you
know
you
be
mentally
unbalanced
when
you
find
lewi
the
least
bit
attractive
,
although
she
be
not
nearly
as
obnoxious
as
usual
in
from
dusk
till
dawn
.
the
first
half
of
the
movie
have
the
criminal
and
hostage
try
to
get
to
and
through
the
mexico
border
,
clooney
's
strategy
involve
hiding
in
the
rv
shower
while
lewi
be
on
the
toilet
.
it
do
its
trick
;
the
border
guard
take
one
look
at
lewi
relieve
herself
and
immediately
go
blind
,
never
notice
clooney
or
tarantino
.
once
they
get
to
mexico
,
it
be
time
to
wait
at
the
rendezvous
point
,
a
topless
bar
call
titty
twister
where
we
be
once
again
remind
tarantino
write
the
movie
as
he
drink
champagne
off
the
foot
of
a
stripper
.
finally
,
after
about
ten
minute
of
intercut
boob
shot
and
clooney
force
keitel
and
lewi
to
drink
with
he
,
the
stripper
turn
into
a
vampire
.
soon
half
the
people
in
the
bar
be
vampire
and
the
other
half
fall
or
fight
back
.
that
be
right
,
we
have
come
all
this
way
to
see
a
vampire
movie
.
but
like
everything
else
,
tarantino
take
this
age-old
genre
and
twist
it
to
he
own
end
to
produce
over-the-top
entertainment
.
so
we
get
holy
water
condom
balloon
,
head
roll
,
quadruple
impalement
on
a
overturn
table
and
keitel
get
bite
by
a
vampire
and
announce
he
only
have
a
few
minute
leave
before
he
become
''
a
lap
dog
of
satan
.
''
the
from
dusk
till
dawn
dialogue
be
100
%
tarantino
,
hover
between
absurd
and
disgusting
-lrb-
as
when
they
be
enter
the
nightclub
and
cheech
marin
announce
the
main
attraction
of
the
titty
twister
-rrb-
,
but
always
entertaining
,
and
be
a
huge
reason
the
movie
be
so
much
fun
to
watch
instead
of
be
one
more
second-rate
gorefest
.
clooney
,
keitel
and
especially
tarantino
be
so
over-the-top
with
they
delivery
that
the
dialogue
be
that
much
more
hilarious
,
ensure
not
one
second
of
from
dusk
till

take
the
least
bit
seriously
.
stuff
like
this
would
be
terrible
in
any
other
movie
,
but
tarantino
and
rodriguez
know
exactly
what
to
do
to
entertain
people
,
even
if
there
be
absolutely
no
message
or
mean
to
from
dusk
till
dawn
.
pulp
fiction
have
the
vulgarity
and
violence
for
a
reason
,
but
this
movie
just
throw
it
out
for
cheap
entertainment
.
from
dusk
till
dawn
be
not
the
classic
of
modern
cinema
that

be
do
prove
you
can

make
a
really
bad
movie
