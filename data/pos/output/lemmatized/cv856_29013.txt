as

-lrb-

,
it
be
up
in
the
air
whether
or
not
we
should
accept
he
detailed
monologue
about
life
after
the
polar
ice

have
melt
.
the
question
prove
to
be
moot
,
at

for
a
time
.
even
if
the
whole
thing
prove
to
be
a

,
one
agree
with

down
on

-rrb-
,
but
be
not
quite
sure
how
to
handle
''
sam

''
when
he
start
explain
the
barcode
on
he
arm
,
he
elaborately
construct
fake
identity
,
he
pathological
fear
of

,
he
ability
to
speak

and
he
mission
to
change
a

that
may
have
ramification
on

-lrb-
do
not

-rrb-
it
be
all
a

much
to

ya
can
not
have

without
the

,
though
nadium

invest
the
thankless
role
with
warmth
-rrb-
chalk
it
up
as
a
sexy
role-playing
game
,

warn
she
that

again
and
she

with

another

who
ya
gonna
believe
?
despite
she
win
a
academy
award
,
marisa
tomeus
have
always
strike
I
as
a
annoying
and
unwelcome
screen
presence
,
one
that
undermine
the
pleasure
of
watch
happy
accident
.
she
brassy
new
yawk
attitude
never
really
mesh
with
she
desperate
desire
to
appear
''
cute
''
to

adoring
fan

loud
and
flash
a

disingenuous
-rrb-

not
necessarily
equal

''
it
take
more
than
a
crack
team
of
hair
and
wardrobe
people
to
imbue
she
with
personality
.
then
there
be
that
damned
voice
,
which
strain
to
be
oh-so-adorable
.
look
,
this
stuff
be
purely
subjective
.
some
people
feel
this
way
about
richard
gere
,
other
can
not
bear
to
watch
robin
william
'
hyperactive
schtick
.
for
my
money
,
it
be
m

tomeus
with
a
bullet
.
happy

be
a
romantic
comedy
filter
through

employ
as

throughout

.
modern
manhattan
be
film
with
a
otherworldly
,
vaguely
alien
eye
with
a
color
scheme
oddly
reminiscent
of
logan
's
run
.
as
the
stranger
in
a
strange
land
,
d'onofrio
walk
slightly
out-of-step
,
wonderfully
affable
but
often
inscrutable
with
he
wayward
expression
and
bemused
detachment
.
this
be
science
fiction
tell
mainly
via
the
power
of
suggestion
-lrb-
though
it
often
fall
into
the
sci-fi
trap
of
have
entirely
too
much
force
exposition
--
we
want
deed
,
not
word
!
-rrb-
at
least
twenty
minute
too
long
,
happy
accident
eventually
get
around
to
a
race-against-time
scenario
that
put
''
sam
deed
''
to
the
ultimate
test
.
no
movie
can
live
in
ambiguity
forever
,
but
anderson
seem
terminally
unable
to
provide
satisfactory
conclusion
to
he
otherwise
well
structured
recent
narrative
.
-lrb-
let
's
pretend
the
loathsome
and
predictable
next
stop
wonderland
never
happen
,
shall
we
?
-rrb-
there
be
also
some
slow
,
repetitive
stretch
as
ruby
and
sam
go
over
the
same
argument
again
and
again
over
whether
or
not
he
be
crazy
.
the
premise
be
strong
enough
to
sustain
interest
,
but
it
be
enough
to
throw
a
nod
in
the
general
direction
of
rod
serling
for
wrap
up
he
idea
in
half-hour
time
slot
,

include
