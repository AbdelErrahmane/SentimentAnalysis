and

he
idea
of

come
under
attack
one
day
when
a
studio
light
fall
from
the
sky
.
the
radio
explain
that
a

start
come
apart

but
then
why
would
a

?
the
next
day
during

drive
to

,
the

start
pick
up
a
voice
that
exactly
describe

truman
be
really
suspicious
now
.
it
get
even
worse
the
next
day
when

,
describe
a
elevator
accident
in
the

,

to
see
who
or
what
be
behind
this
apparently
elaborate

at

be
stop
by
a
amazing
coincidence
that
just
happen
to
keep

he
last
hope
be
to
quell
he
fear
of
the
ocean
and
sail
to
the
edge
of
the
world
.
you
know
by
now
that
truman
's
life
be
the
subject
of
a
television
program
.
he
action
be
''
real
''

everything
else

the
all-seeing
creator
of

do
he
best
to
keep
he
unaware
and
happy
.
it
be
sort
of
like

,
or

we
root
for

elaborate
trap
.
the
story
,
write
by
andrew
niccol
-lrb-
writer\/director
of
gattaca
-rrb-
,
introduce
some
interesting
question
,
such
as
the
ethic
of
subject
a
person
to
this
type
of
life
,
or
the
psychological
impact
of
learn
that
you
entire
life
have
all
be
fake
.
although
these
question
come
to
mind
,
i
do
not
think
the
film
itself
ask
they
.
it
certainly
do
not
address
they
or
try
to
answer
they
.
i
be
particularly
disappoint
that
the
film
do
not
deal
more
with
the
trauma
of
learn
one
's
life
be
a
tv
show
.
carrey
's
performance
at
the
end
show
a
smidgen
of
truman
's
pain
,
but
i
almost
feel
that
he
get
over
it
too
easily
for
the
sake
of
the
film
's
pacing
.
earlier
in
the
movie
i
find
myself
wonder
if
it
would
be
better
for
truman
to
find
out
the
truth
or
whether
i
should
root
for
he
to
be
well
.
the
two
seem
exclusive
of
one
another
,
but
weir
and
niccol
do
not
see
it
that
way
.
perhaps
it
be
not
fair
to
criticize
a
movie
for
what
it
be
not
,
but
it
seem
like
there
be
some
miss
opportunity
here
.
but
on
its
own
term
,
the
movie
be
well
make
.
sight
,
sound
and
pacing
be
all
handle
competently
.
much
of
the
first
part
of
the
movie
be
the
truman
show
.
the
scene
be
all
apparently
shoot
from
hidden
camera
,
with
snoot
and
obstruction
cover
the
corner
of
the
screen
.
one
hidden
camera
be
apparently
in
he
car
radio
,
the
green
lead
number
obscure
the
lower
part
of
the
screen
.
the
music
be
well-chosen
and
score
.
the
film
open
with
what
sound
like
family
drama
theme
music
,
when
truman
's
world
be
still
beautiful
and
perfect
.
when
the
movie
end
,
the
score
sound
more
like
a
frantic
,
drive
,
tangerine
dream
opus
,
while
still
keep
the
same
timbre
.
philip
glass
'
epic
music
-lrb-
from
powaqqatsus
-rrb-
permeate
truman
's
scene
of
suspicion
and
awakening
.
-lrb-
glass
have
a
small
cameo
as
a
keyboardist
for
the
show
.
-rrb-
and
the
pacing
of
the
story
be
brisk
.
there
be
no
unnecessarily
long
setup
explain
the
concept
behind
the
truman
show
,
just
a
few
quick
title
card
,
a
few
interview
,
and
then
right
into
the
show
,
and
the
movie
.
one
of
the
first
scene
be
of
the
studio
light
fall
;
there
be
no
token
scene
of
truman
's
idyllic
life
before
it
fall
apart
,
because
it
be
not
necessary
,
we
pick
up
the
story
at
the
first
sign
of
trouble
,
and
no
sooner
.
there
be
also
no
point
in
the
movie
where
the
plot
slow
down
.
it
be
a
quick
,
straight
shot
to
the
movie
's
end
.
in
term
of
overall
quality
,
i
would
compare
the
truman
show
to
niccol
's
gattaca
.
both
film
be
well
make
with
interesting
story
set
in
interesting
world
.
but
neither
film
really
feel
like
it
capitalize
on
all
the
great
idea
;
neither
film
''
click
''
and
become
a
instant
classic
.
nevertheless
,
i
look
forward
to
niccol
's
next
film
,
whatever
it
may
be
.
