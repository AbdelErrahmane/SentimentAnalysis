reputation
at
the
sundance
film
festival
,
be
a
dazzling
and
kinetic
film
that
deal
with
the
subject
of
fate
and
chance
.
for
a
berserk
and
retroactive
81
minute
of
non-stop
movement
,
we
follow
a
fiery-haired
heroine
name
lolum
-lrb-
franka
potente
-rrb-
as
she
sprint
to
save
she
boyfriend
from
the
clutch
of
drug
dealer
.
lolum
have
roughly
twenty
minute
to
somehow
retrieve
100
,
000
mark
in
time
to
save
mannus
-lrb-
moritz
bleibtreu
-rrb-
from
be
kill
by
the
dealer
.
but
,
in
something
of
a
pseudo
-
`
groundhog
day
'
approach
,
director
tom
tykwer
give
lolum
three
separate
chance
to
best
navigate
she
way
toward
the
goal
.
in
these
trio
of
episode
,
we
gradually
learn
the
unique
effect
of
fate
,
for
even
if
tiny
change
be
make
in
lolum
's
journey
,
the
future
can
be
seriously
altered
.
`
run
lolum
run
'
be
a
experience
like
`
fight
club
'
or
`
the
matrix
'
,
in
that
each
film
take
you
through
a
super-charged
wormhole
of
bend
reality
in
surreal
and
exciting
way
.
in
addition
,
all
three
movie
have
a
visual
style
that
separate
they
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
.
`
lolum
'
be
no
exception
,
with
stylish
quick-flash
camera
work
and
cinematography
that
serve
as
scintillating
eye
candy
from
the
get-go
.
tykwer
's
world
be
a
landscape
of
mood
and
color
,
with
brilliant
shades
of
red
and
pink
-lrb-
include
lolum
's
fiery
hair
-rrb-
use
as
effective
symbolism
throughout
.
with
it
be
visual
style
and
mind-blowing
pace
,
`
run
lolum
run
'
be
one
of
the
more
invigorating
movie
of
the
year
.
even
more
so
when
consider
the
fact
it
be
all
stuff
rather
nonchalantly
into
a
81-minute
time
period
.
as
a
heroine
,
potente
do
little
more
than
run
wildly
through
the
street
-lrb-
as
the
title
suggest
-rrb-
,
but
she
have
a
certain
flair
and
charisma
.
she
exemplary
run
form
make
I
wonder
if
she
be
actually
a
track
star
.
meanwhile
,
bleibtreu
do
a
equally
fantastic
job
of
bring
the
dopey
but
passionate
mannus
to
life
.
both
actor
perform
beyond
the
call
of
duty
.
the
dazzling
fun
come
from
predict
what
each
episode
hold
in
store
for
lolum
,
and
the
outcome
be
ultimately
rewarding
-
several
twist
and
turn
be
unique
and
unexpected
.
the
other
character
lola
run
into
-lrb-
both
purposely
and
inadvertently
-rrb-
include
she
banker
father
-lrb-
herbert
kraup
-rrb-
and
a
friendly
security
guard
-lrb-
armin
rohde
-rrb-
,
but
aside
from
the
two
lead
,
no
one
have
more
than
a
few
minute
of
screen
time
.
additional
star
that
could
not
possibly
be
ignore
be
cinematographer
frank
griebe
and
editor
mathilde
bonnefroy
,
who
be
both
responsible
for
the
film
's
eye-catching
visual
elegance
.
`
run
lolum
run
'
be
subtitle
,
so
be
prepare
to
meet
the
challenge
of
read
the
lightning-fast
dialogue
-
occasional
section
of
it
be
especially
fast
.
this
be
only
one
of
the
minor
chore
involve
in
watch
.
the
other
be
the
sense
that
we
never
get
to
really
recognize
who
the
real
people
be
in
this
hyperactive
situation
.
most
be
just
chess
piece
in
tykwer
's
elaborate
game
of
visual
presentation
,
and
he
never
really
make
a
significant
move
with
any
.
but
,
the
average
viewer
be
likely
to
be
so
absorb
in
the
action
that
few
will
realize
the
lack
of
potency
in
a
few
element
of
the
screenplay
.
a
few
petty
gripe
aside
,
this
film
be
a
wild
,
exhilarating
ride
that
turn
maniacally
on
its
wheel
of
originality
.
most
people
believe
foreign
film
be
mainly
boring
,
talky
character
study
.
perhaps
`
run
lolum
run
'
will
recharge
they
battery
.
not
only
do
this
film
offer
insight
into
some
intriguing
question
of
fate
and
destiny
,
it
also
deliver
a
white-knuckle
visual
rollercoaster
ride
of
overwhelming
audacity
.
like
how
the
experience
must
have
be
for
the
persistent
title
character
,
`
run
lolum
run
'
be
exhausting
.
