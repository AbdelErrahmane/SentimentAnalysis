airplane
!
be
consider
among
many
to
be
the
epitome
of
satire
film-making
.
after
all
,
it
be
bring
to
we
by
one
of
the
best
know
satire
writing\/directing
team
.
even
if
most
people
do
not
recognize
the
name
behind
the
film
,
they
be
bind
to
recognize
the
title
:
airplane
!
,
top
secret
,
the
naked
gun
,
and
hot
shot
to
name
a
few
.
but
although
the
zucker\/abrahams\/zucker
team
be
first
introduce
with
the
kentucky
fried
movie
in
1977
,
airplane
!
remain
the
true
cornerstone
of
they
work
,
and
they
directorial
debut
.
in
the
seventy
,
disaster
film
seem
to
be
at
a
all
time
high
.
film
like
earthquake
,
the
towering
inferno
,
and
the
poseidon
adventure
be
big
hit
.
there
be
also
a
series
about
the
disaster
that
can
arise
when
travel
by
plane
-
a
series
that
span
the
entire
decade
.
and
so
,
in
1980
,
we
be
introduce
to
a
new
airplane
disaster
film
.
this
time
the
disaster
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
maniacal
hijacker
or
crash
into
the
ocean
.
.
.
it
have
to
do
with
bad
fish
.
airplane
!
be
the
story
of
ted
striker
-lrb-
robert
hay
-rrb-
-
a
ex-fighter-pilot
who
have
never
get
over
the
fact
that
a
decision
he
have
to
make
in
the
midst
of
war
lead
to
the
death
of
six
,
er
,
seven
comrade
.
unable
to
stop
live
in
the
past
,
ted
's
world
fall
apart
.
he
spend
he
time
move
from
city
to
city
without
ever
have
a
stable
job
,
and
eventually
,
as
we
begin
this
film
,
be
get
dump
by
he
lover
,
flight
attendant
elaine
dickinson
-lrb-
julie
hagerty
-rrb-
.
in
a
desperate
attempt
not
to
lose
she
,
ted
buy
a
ticket
for
the
same
flight
elaine
be
work
.
unfortunately
,
she
be
unsympathetic
and
even
criticize
ted
for
follow
she
,
which
leave
he
wallow
in
self-pity
.
in
the
midst
of
it
all
,
something
happen
.
someone
get
sick
.
then
another
.
then
another
.
soon
,
the
whole
plane
be
full
of
deathly-ill
chicago-bound
people
.
.
.
and
when
the
pilot
get
sick
-lrb-
play
by
peter
grave
,
kareem
abdul-jabbar
,
and
frank
ashmore
-rrb-
,
who
will
save
the
day
?
-lrb-
gee
,
i
wonder
-rrb-
of
course
the
main
draw
here
be
the
non-stop
''
whiz-bang
''
comedy
,
with
a
hefty
dose
of
both
visual
and
speak
gag
.
although
i
have
see
this
movie
a
few
time
before
,
i
be
still
laugh
thru
the
entire
thing
.
the
most
fun
character
by
far
be
the
doctor
,
play
by
leslie
nielsen
.
he
be
a
dry
,
subtle
,
sterotypically
straight-faced
doctor
that
end
up
say
some
of
the
funniest
line
of
the
film
.
in
a
film
like
this
,
you
be
not
really
expect
a
elaborate
production
,
so
one
can
not
complain
about
the
amateurish
quality
.
what
you
can
complain
about
be
the
absolutely
annoying
johnny
,
play
by
stephen
stucker
.
this
character
be
pointless
,
nauseating
,
and
very
unfunny
.
i
do
not
know
why
he
be
put
in
there
,
and
i
do
not
think
anybody
will
find
a
good
excuse
.
and
when
the
film
near
a
end
,
it
slow
down
quite
a
bit
,
almost
get
old
.
you
gotta
give
it
to
a
movie
that
only
run
88
minute
and
can
feel
two
hour
long
.
aside
from
that
,
airplane
!
be
really
a
top-notch
spoof
that
will
likely
forever
be
know
as
a
spoof
classic
.
it
would
be
a
good
choice
to
pop
in
the
vcr
with
a
group
of
friend
,
especially
if
they
have
not
see
it
.
and
if
they
ask
what
the
plot
be
,
just
tell
'em
''
it
be
a
synopsis
of
the
basic
storyline
of
the
film
,
but
that
be
not
important
right
now
.
''
if
you
have
see
the
film
,
you
'll
understand
