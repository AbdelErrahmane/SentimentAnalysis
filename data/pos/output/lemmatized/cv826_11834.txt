together
they
face
all
sort
of
sexual
allegation
,
the
irritatingly
discourteous
media
and
other
witty
politician
in
the
election
race
.
in
its
satire
and
controversy
,
primary
color
be
a
similar
film
to
wag
the
dog
:
they
both
be
not
afraid
to
wipe
they
nose
in
the
nitty-gritty
and
take
a
bold
look
at
something
that
will
never
have
honesty
as
a
virtue
.
but
whereas
wag
show
we
how
much
affect
a
few
people
can
have
on
the
media
,
primary
color
be
much
more
concerned
with
flesh
out
it
be
character
,
let
we
understand
what
they
want
and
why
,
and
make
we
truly
appreciate
the
humanity
and
rectitude
that
they
graciously
represent
.
see
john
travolta
play
bill
clinton
so
confidently
and
justly
be
enough
to
make
the
film
more
than
worth
a
look
.
and
the
rest
of
the
cast
also
make
superb
performance
-
adrian
lester
sharply
portray
the
intellect
of
henry
whilst
kathy
bate
be
perfect
as
the
robust
and
energetic
libby
holden
.
at
occasion
,
you
can
not
help
but
feel
that
these
terrific
character
be
go
to
waste
.
there
be
long
slab
of
time
where
john
travolta
-lrb-
unquestionably
the
most
interesting
to
watch
-rrb-
be
miss
from
the
screen
;
and
since
it
be
awkwardly
structure
as
henry
's
story
we
be
often
force
to
watch
scene
that
perhaps
be
not
so
necessary
to
the
central
plot
-
or
even
the
point
of
the
film
.
have
say
that
,
make
no
mistake
-
primary
color
be
always
enjoyable
to
watch
.
but
frequently
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
-
exactly
what
be
we
watch
?
most
of
the
first
half
of
its
duration
be
a
lightheaded
look
at
melodramatic
confrontation
that
seem
so
genuine
we
can
not
help
but
laugh
,
but
the
way
primary
color
choose
to
finish
tackle
aspect
that
be
very
contrary
,
and
almost
unsuitable
,
to
the
rest
of
the
film
.
but
as
i
mention
before
,
there
be
a
thin
line
between
satire
and
controversy
-
and
for
the
most
part
,
primary
color
deliver
a
entertaining
indulgence
of
political
matter
combine
with
a
far-from-overpowering
look
at
win
the
public
's
opinion
.
although
at
occasion
the
film
may
jump
around
a
little
too
freely
,
focus
be
never
lose
on
how
important
and
vulnerable
the
subject
matter
really
be
.
thankfully
,
it
be
clear
to
make
the
distinction
on
what
be
entertaining
movie
cosmetic
and
what
be
a
provocative
documentation
of
something
so
really
it
be
scary
.
