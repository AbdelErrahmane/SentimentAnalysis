i
be
originally
go
to
give
the
spanish
prisoner
two
and
half
star
.
from
my
first
viewing
,
i
notice
that
david
mamet
's
film
be
intense
and
clever
at
time
but
boring
and
cliched
at
other
time
especially
at
the
beginning
.
from
my
second
viewing
however
,
i
notice
that
mamet
's
script
be
actually
a
masterpiece
.
the
spanish
prisoner
,
like
the
usual
suspect
or
chinatown
,
beg
for
the
viewer
's
complete
attention
.
miss
a
scene
or
even
a
small
detail
,
and
you
could
miss
the
meaning
of
the
entire
film
.
also
like
the
aforementioned
film
,
it
reward
its
viewer
for
pay
attention
by
deliver
a
surprising
and
memorable
ending
.
mamet
be
success
do
again
what
he
once
tackle
in
1987
when
he
write
and
direct
house
of
game
.
like
he
past
gem
,
the
spanish
prisoner
fool
the
audience
as
much
-lrb-
or
even
more
-rrb-
than
the
victim
.
because
we
be
deceive
just
like
the
victim
,
we
feel
a
strong
attachment
to
the
main
character
and
consequently
be
more
interested
in
the
film
.
mamet
have
the
talent
of
not
completely
end
a
film
gift
wrap
,
but
rather
leave
some
ambiguity
towards
the
end
.
the
power
that
he
have
in
force
the
viewer
to
determine
who
the
good
guy
and
bad
guy
be
once
the
film
be
over
,
without
give
a
right
answer
,
be
unique
and
ingenious
.
the
spanish
prisoner
will
leave
you
seriously
puzzle
and
intrigue
.
after
see
the
film
again
,
i
notice
that
the
detail
mamet
use
be
so
incredibly
accurate
it
be
frightening
.
he
direction
be
very
subtle
;
as
he
leave
so
many
clue
explain
what
be
go
on
and
who
be
who
but
it
be
still
very
difficult
to
tell
what
exactly
be
happen
even
if
you
see
all
of
they
,
or
think
you
see
all
of
they
.
the
story
follow
a
young
up
and
come
businessman
,
joe
ross
,
-lrb-
campbell
scott
-rrb-
who
have
just
create
a
mysterious
and
lucrative
''
process
''
that
everyone
be
try
to
get
they
hand
on
.
soon
ross
do
not
know
who
he
can
trust
or
who
be
after
he
''
process
.
''
through
he
journey
ross
meet
a
number
of
mysterious
character
:
the
rich
and
popular
jimmy
dell
,
a
secretary
who
have
a
huge
crush
on
ross
,
and
ross
'
boss
mr
.
klein
.
play
by
steve
martin
,
rebecca
pidgeon
,
and
ben
gazarra
respectively
,
the
support
cast
be
very
solid
especially
martin
,
who
deserve
a
oscar
nomination
for
he
commanding
and
manipulative
role
.
the
most
interesting
character
in
the
film
,
though
,
be
campbell
scott
's
joe
ross
.
the
character
's
transformation
from
a
ingenuous
and
polite
rookie
to
a
paranoid
veteran
be
very
apparent
and
justifiable
.
david
mamet
's
script
be
so
interesting
because
we
know
people
do
not
actually
talk
like
the
character
in
the
film
,
yet
we
feel
so
connect
to
some
of
they
.
he
beguiling
style
could
fool
any
viewer
up
for
the
challenge
.
this
be
a
must
see
,
for
those
interested
in
solve
a
complex
puzzle
of
a
movie
.
