it

loosely

book
the
1973
thriller
''
the
day

''
,
comparison
between
the
two
film
be
inevitable
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
original
be
the
better
movie
,
play
the
story
for
suspense
rather
than
the
current
action\/adventure

as
a
mystery
,
''
the
jackal
''
have
enough
hole
in
it
to
ruin
the
tale
,
but
if
you
can
accept
it
for
what
it
be
,
there
be
entertainment
to
be
have

hole
?
let
's
see
?
a
pivotal
clue
for
mulqueen
be
so
obscure
that
he
must
possess
psychic
power
to
pick
it
up
.
for
a
20-year
veteran
that
can
command
the
big
buck
,
the
jackal
be
a
incredibly
poor
shot
.
the
final
scene
between
gere
and
willi
occur
in
a
location
that
should
be
mob
with
police
,
but
it
be
just
the
two
of
they
.
willi
'
disguise
usually
look
like
bruce
willi
and
be
just
as
interesting
as
val
kilmer
's
in
''
the
saint
''
.
-lrb-
and
lest
you
misunderstand
,
that
be
not
a
compliment
.
-rrb-
but
the
three
star
be
fun
to
watch
.
it
be
good
to
see
gere
in
something
other
than
a
business
suit
.
willi
have
a
mixed
history
in
pick
project
,
but
he
character
be
always
watchable
.
poitier
be
by
far
the
superior
actor
,
but
have
limit
screen
time
.
the
problem
in
logic
be
flaw
,
but
do
not
ruin
the
experience
.
occasionally
there
be
movie
that
transcend
they
blemish
.
this
be
one
of
they
