the
verdict
:
spine-chilling
drama
from
horror
maestro
stephen
king
,
feature
a
outstanding
,
oscar-winning
performance
from
kathy
bate
.
geez
,
french
and
saunder
have
a
field
day
when
they
set
to
work
on
parody
this
!
sorry
,
non-british
reader
may
not
be
familiar
with
french
and
saunder
-
my
apology
.
the
pair
be
british
comedienne
-lrb-
jennifer
saunder
later
go
on
to
become
edina
monsoon
in
''
absolutely
fabulous
''
-rrb-
,
who
do
a
series
of
film
spoof
a
few
year
back
,
include
alien
,
the
exorcist
and
misery
.
needless
to
say
,
amidst
she
chucklesome
impersonation
of
kathy
bate
-lrb-
the
resemblance
be
quite
uncanny
!
-rrb-
,
dawn
french
get
pretty
nasty
with
she
sledgehammer
when
in
reach
of
jennifer
saunder
's
leg
!
but
despite
the
linger
memory
of
they
sketch
,
and
although
i
have
now
see
the
film
a
couple
of
time
now
,
that
''
hobble
''
scene
be
no
less
disturbing
!
i
be
still
leave
scream
at
the
telly
in
revulsion
!
that
may
be
the
most
memorable
scene
,
but
it
be
certainly
not
the
only
worth
watch
.
stephen
king
,
whose
film
and
tv
adaptation
tend
to
vary
in
quality
,
strike
gold
with
this
simple
yet
strikingly
compelling
tale
.
it
be
a
nicely
craft
psychological
horror
,
which
effortlessly
succeed
in
draw
you
into
the
plight
of
writer
phil
sheldon
-lrb-
jame
caan
-rrb-
.
rescue
from
a
car
accident
by
annie
wilke
-lrb-
bate
-rrb-
,
who
introduce
herself
as
the
writer
's
''
number
one
fan
''
,
he
soon
become
she
prisoner
.
both
the
script
and
kathy
bate
'
beautifully
masterful
performance
-lrb-
for
which
she
win
a
oscar
-rrb-
work
arm-in-arm
as
we
quickly
begin
to
realize
that
beyond
she
bubbly
exterior
the
woman
be
basically
as
nutty
as
a
fruit-cake
-lrb-
or
be
that
fruity
as
a
nut-cake
?
-rrb-
.
bate
relish
she
demand
role
,
and
she
performance
be
nothing
short
of
a
masterpiece
.
at
time
she
seem
like
a
innocent
victim
of
she
own
obsessive
behavior
,
at
time
she
be
a
rather
tragic
character
,
and
more
often
than
not
she
be
just
damned
scary
!
this
be
basically
a
very
simple
tale
,
but
it
achieve
a
large
degree
of
eloquence
in
its
simplicity
.
it
be
a
involve
,
engross
experience
-
and
consider
it
be
basically
a
two-hander
,
mainly
set
in
one
locale
,
it
be
a
remarkable
piece
of
cinema
.
there
be
no
jazzy
special
effect
or
cheesy
action
sequence
-
this
one
rely
solely
upon
rob
reiner
's
stylish
directing
and
the
wonderful
performance
of
bate
and
caan
.
oh
,
i
have
not
really
mention
caan
yet
-
he
do
a
good
job
as
the
writer
who
be
a
prisoner
of
he
own
success
-lrb-
annie
be
obsess
with
he
and
he
book
-rrb-
.
but
,
as
you
no
doubt
gather
from
the
above
-
bate
be
well
and
truly
the
star
of
the
show
.
along
with
the
pig
,
of
course
!
anyway
,
the
tension
be
built-up
with
masterful
aplomb
,
and
some
scene
be
almost
agonisingly
tense
.
there
be
the
dinner
scene
where
seldon
go
to
nerve-shattering
length
to
poison
she
wine
.
he
succeed
,
but
...
she
knock
the
glass
over
!
i
bet
you
throw
a
pillow
at
the
screen
as
well
!
in
the
immortal
word
of
homer
j
.
simpson
-
''
d'oh
!
!
''
other
nerve-wracking
scene
include
the
bit
where
annie
have
go
off
to
town
and
sheldon
start
snoop
around
the
house
.
we
cut
to
annie
in
she
car
-
she
be
on
she
way
home
...
he
realize
this
and
try
to
get
back
to
he
room
...
cut
to
the
car
again
,
she
be
get
near
...
will
he
make
it
?
ok
,
so
these
sequence
be
not
exactly
original
,
nor
perhaps
unpredictable
-
but
they
work
!
boy
,
do
they
work
!
if
a
film
have
you
on
the
edge
of
you
couch
,
bite
you
nail
and
shout
at
the
screen
in
suspense
,
then
it
be
do
something
right
!
of
course
,
the
most
nauseating
sequence
be
the
aforementioned
''
hobble
''
!
annie
realize
she
captive
have
be
out
of
he
room
,
and
she
be
go
to
stop
he
once
and
for
all
.
cue
a
block
of
wood
place
strategically
between
he
ankle
and
a
huge
sledgehammer
,
and
...
i
feel
ill
just
think
about
it
!
nasty
.
it
all
build
up
nicely
to
the
final
scene
where
sheldon
finally
get
the
upper
hand
,
and
once
and
for
all
try
to
kill
the
crazy
psycho
!
and
then
we
be
give
one
of
the
most
ridiculously
over-the-top
fight
scene
i
have
ever
see
.
she
get
hit
over
the
head
with
a
typewriter
,
set
on
fire
,
head
smash
against
the
wall
-
and
she
just
will
not
die
!
sheldon
be
not
in
terribly
good
shape
either
.
if
it
be
not
so
gorey
it
would
almost
be
laughable
.
but
it
be
a
terrifically
effective
film
,
and
therefore
the
daft
climax
be
easily
overlook
.
misery
be
a
tight
,
tense
,
intense
and
chillingly
entertaining
thriller
.
the
directing
be
first-rate
,
and
the
performance
-
bate
in
particular
-
contribute
to
make
this
a
suitably
nightmarish
little
gem
.
wonderful
stuff
.
