devotee
of
robert
a
.
heinlein
,
be
forewarn
:
paul
verhoeven
's
starship
trooper
be
less
a
adaptation
of
heinlein
's
novel
than
it
be
a
literary
satire
.
the
author
's
jingo-all-the-way
militarism
and
he
tendency
to
create
plastic
character
with
plastic
conflict
have
I
expect
a
soulless
,
faceless
parade
of
carnage
from
the
film
version
.
and
i
suppose
that
be
exactly
what
verhoeven
deliver
,
with
sometimes
hilarious
result
.
heinlein
's
basic
motif
be
so
faithfully
render
that
they
flaw
become
a
source
of
amusement
,
while
they
strength
become
the
stuff
of
high-energy
entertainment
.
outline
the
plot
of
starship
trooper
be
a
fairly
silly
endeavor
,
since
it
be
basically
a
big
bug
hunt
...
alien
in
broad
daylight
.
sometime
in
the
future
,
humanity
be
threaten
by
giant
,
malevolent
insect
which
have
evolve
into
twenty-foot-tall
action
figure
-lrb-
arachnid
with
super-impaling
spike
,
beetle
that
spew
forth
lava
,
dragonfly
with
guillotine
leg
-rrb-
.
among
those
who
sign
on
to
save
the
earth
be
a
group
of
high
school
classmate
from
bueno
aire
:
conflicted
rich
kid
johnny
rico
-lrb-
casper
van
dien
-rrb-
;
he
math
whiz
girlfriend
carman
-lrb-
denise
richard
-rrb-
;
dizzy
-lrb-
dina
meyer
-rrb-
,
who
secretly
carry
a
torch
for
johnny
;
and
carl
-lrb-
neil
patrick
''
doogie
howser
''
harri
-rrb-
,
who
not-so-secretly
carry
a
torch
for
dizzy
,
and
also
have
a
talent
for
speak
telepathically
to
ferret
.
while
carman
head
for
flight
school
and
carl
join
military
intelligence
,
johnny
and
dizzy
become
mobile
infantry
,
they
various
battle
intertwine
with
romantic
sub-plot
out
of
a
third
season
episode
from
''
beverly
hill

so
if
starship
trooper
be
another
movie
where
one-dimensional
character
wade
through
trite
situation
on
they
way
to
kill
a
bunch
of
alien
,
what
make
it
any
better
than
,
say
,
independence
day
,
a
movie
where
one-dimensional
character
wade
through
trite
situation
on
they
way
to
kill
a
bunch
of
slightly
different
alien
?
for
one
thing
,
you
sense
that
the
film-maker
be
aware
of
the
pulp
nonsense
they
have
as
source
material
.
the
very
absence
of
major
star
in
the
cast
feel
thematically
appropriate
,
not
just
fiscally
prudent
.
if
starship
trooper
have
be
turn
into
a
tv-movie
,
aaron
spelling
would
have
produce
it
.
it
be
a
story
which
require
emoting
,
not
act
;
it
be
a
prime
time
soap
opera
with
big
gun
,
play
for
all
the
dopey
melodrama
it
be
worth
.
the
no-name
cast
also
play
into
verhoeven
's
treatment
of
heinlein
's
most
controversial
conceit
.
in
this
society
,
we
learn
,
one
can
only
be
a
full
citizen
after
complete
some
sort
of
federal
service
,
military
for
most
.
verhoeven
pay
the
notion
plenty
of
lip
service
,
then
proceed
to
skewer
it
with
brilliant
mock
recruitment
ad
-lrb-
name
after
the
world
war
ii-era
''
why
we
fight
''
series
-rrb-
in
which
youngster
be
indoctrinate
into
the
joy
of
firearm
,
or
the
pleasure
of
stomp
cockroach
.
these
character
really
be
just
''
fresh
meat
for
the
grinder
,
''
as
one
character
put
it
,
which
make
they
lack
of
familiarity
all
the
more
fitting
.
it
be
not
that
starship
trooper
be
anti-military
,
because
it
never
treat
the
true
horror
of
war
as
anything
but
a
great
big
,
violent
video
game
.
in
fact
,
the
character
be
live
the
propaganda
-lrb-
particularly
johnny
,
who
receive
so
many
field
promotion
he
may
not
remember
he
own
rank
by
the
time
the
film
end
-rrb-
.
verhoeven
be
actually
have
it
both
way
--
he
be
make
fun
of
gung-ho
boosterism
even
as
he
fire
he
fresh-faced
recruit
into
battle
on
a
gung-ho
booster
rocket
of
visual
effect
.
if
that
make
starship
trooper
hypocritical
,
at
least
it
be
enthusiastically
stage
hypocrisy
.
there
may
not
be
a
person
worth
care
about
in
the
whole
film
,
but
it
move
like
nobody
's
business
.
verhoeven
stage
some
thrilling
action
sequence
,
send
swarm
of
bug
after
the
anonymous
grunt
then
have
various
body
part
strew
about
the
screen
like
landscaping
.
it
be
that
rare
special
effect
blockbuster
which
demonstrate
a
sense
of
pacing
to
match
its
budget
;
i
be
catch
up
in
the
action
enough
of
the
time
that
i
be
not
perpetually
groan
over
the
absence
of
real
human
being
.
i
wish
i
could
find
it
in
myself
to
work
up
more
outrage
over
the
callous
way
human
be
dispatch
in
starship
trooper
,
but
it
do
not
work
out
that
way
.
that
would
be
punish
verhoeven
for
get
to
the
heart
of
he
material
.
