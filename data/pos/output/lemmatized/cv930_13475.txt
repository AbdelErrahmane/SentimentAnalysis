there
be
some
work
of
art
that
be
almost
impossible
to
review
,
not
because
of
they
own
complexity
,
but
because
of
they
legendary
status
which
prevent
the
reviewer
to
say
anything
original
.
one
of
such
masterpiece
be
casablanca
,
probably
not
the
best
film
in
the
history
of
the
seventh
art
,
but
definitely
the
most
popular
one
.
its
popularity
can
be
measure
not
in
a
multitude
of
more
or
less
disguised
remake
that
be
make
in
more
than
half
a
century
since
its
premiere
,
but
also
in
countless
tribute
and
reference
that
movie
maker
use
in
they
work
to
this
day
.
casablanca
be
also
a
movie
that
have
the
very
rare
virtue
of
both
be
praise
by
the
critic
and
love
by
general
audience
.
one
of
the
thing
that
make
this
film
even
more
unique
be
the
fact
that
it
be
doom
to
fail
,
at
least
judge
by
conventional
movie-making
wisdom
of
its
time
.
it
be
base
on
a
broadway
play
so
mediocre
that
it
have
not
be
produce
on
stage
;
screenplay
by
three
writer
-
julius
g
.
epstein
,
philip
j
.
epstein
and
howard
koch
-
be
bee
write
as
shooting
go
along
;
the
main
actor
be
producer
'
second
choice
,
and
,
finally
,
man
behind
camera
,
michael
curtiz
be
consider
to
be
capable
,
but
not
great
director
.
however
,
the
movie
be
commercially
successful
and
earn
three
''
oscar
''
,
include
the
one
for
the
best
film
.
until
this
very
day
,
it
be
consider
to
be
the
best
example
of
hollywood
film
-
make
in
its
own
golden
age
.
the
plot
of
the
movie
be
heavily
influence
by
the
need
of
ww2
propaganda
,
yet
it
also
use
rather
complicate
and
now
almost
forget
political
circumstance
of
that
global
conflict
in
order
to
make
intriguing
story
.
in
December
1941
,
casablanca
,
exotic
port
on
the
atlantic
coast
of
north
africa
be
control
by
officially
neutral
,
yet
nazi-collaborating
french
vichy
government
.
thousand
of
refugee
from
war-torn
europe
be
stick
there
on
the
way
to
lisbon
and
safety
of
america
,
and
ready
to
pay
any
price
for
precious
exit
visa
.
many
shady
character
thrive
on
they
misery
,
include
the
corrupt
police
chief
,
captain
renault
-lrb-
rain
-rrb-
.
he
best
friend
be
rick
blaine
-lrb-
bogart
-rrb-
,
who
use
to
be
idealistic
anti-fascist
,
and
now
own
popular
night
club
in
casablanca
and
life
by
he
own
cynical
philosophy
of
''
stick
he
neck
for
nobody
''
.
however
,
everything
change
when
he
get
in
possession
of
two
precious
extra
visa
.
this
event
coincide
with
the
arrival
of
two
new
refugee
to
casablanca
.
one
of
they
be
victor
laszlo
-lrb-
henreid
-rrb-
,
czech
resistance
leader
who
escape
three
time
from
nazi
concentration
camp
and
become
the
legend
of
enslaved
europe
.
he
be
accompany
by
he
beautiful
wife
ilsa
lund
-lrb-
bergman
-rrb-
,
with
whom
rick
have
a
stormy
affair
in
the
eve
of
nazi
occupation
of
pari
.
the
couple
need
visa
,
especially
because
of
the
gestapo
major
strasser
-lrb-
veidt
-rrb-
be
on
they
trail
.
rick
be
now
force
to
choose
between
love
,
wound
pride
,
self-preserving
interest
and
he
own
hatred
of
fascism
.
the
casting
for
this
movie
seem
influence
by
divine
inspiration
-
humphrey
bogart
,
most
legendary
actor
in
the
history
of
cinema
,
be
one
of
the
rare
character
actor
who
elevate
he
persona
to
the
star
status
.
bogart
's
portrayal
of
rick
as
complicated
man
,
tear
between
idealistic
past
and
bitter
present
,
be
so
perfect
,
that
he
icon
would
forever
be
connect
with
that
character
.
another
icon
in
he
company
be
ingrid
bergman
,
great
actress
of
old
hollywood
,
here
in
she
artistic
and
visual
prime
.
the
cinematic
coupling
of
bogart
and
bergman
become
one
of
the
main
symbol
of
that
era
of
filmmaking
-
some
happier
time
when
the
romance
on
the
screen
do
not
look
childish
nor
trite
like
in
some
more
contemporary
work
.
for
many
people
,
casablanca
be
probably
the
best
romantic
film
ever
make
.
but
the
reason
for
that
be
not
the
romance
itself
-
it
be
the
realistic
story
of
people
force
to
make
tough
,
and
often
wrong
choice
in
they
life
.
the
casting
of
casablanca
be
right
on
target
not
just
in
a
case
of
main
lead
.
the
support
actor
also
do
a
marvellous
job
.
sidney
longstreet
and
peter
lorre
be
here
mainly
to
give
a
mystic
flavor
spot
in
a
previous
bogart
classic
-
john
huston
's
maltese
falcon
;
yet
both
of
they
manage
to
portray
colorful
and
original
character
.
another
shine
example
of
good
casting
be
now
almost
forget
paul
henreid
as
the
weakest
part
of
love
triangle
;
character
of
victor
laszlo
have
believable
charisma
and
look
like
a
somebody
who
could
inspire
million
of
people
to
rise
against
nazi
tiranny
.
unfortunately
,
the
charisma
that
burden
laszlo
,
leave
little
place
for
difficult
choice
,
make
he
character
forever
overshadow
by
rick\/ilsa
coupling
.
however
,
rick
and
ilsa
actually
have
a
serious
competiton
for
most
memorable
character
in
casablanca
.
captain
renault
,
brilliantly
portray
by
claude
rain
in
a
role
of
a
lifetime
,
be
embodiment
of
perfect
,
almost
unmatched
balance
between
ethical
corruption
and
physical
charm
.
despite
be
the
undoubtful
villain
in
almost
entire
movie
,
rain
manage
to
make
renault
sympathetic
character
,
and
he
final
conversion
to
the
side
of
good
,
symbolize
in
not
so
subtle
gesture
at
the
end
of
movie
look
unnecessary
.
rain
also
give
another
dimension
to
the
movie
,
make
it
even
more
ambiguous
;
people
who
like
to
analyze
movie
to
death
discover
sign
of
homosexuality
in
renault
's
relationship
towards
rick
,
and
rick
's
final
word
leave
room
for
even
more
outrageous
speculation
.
together
with
well-drawn
character
and
exciting
story
,
the
movie
be
good
in
create
he
own
atmosphere
.
professional
nitpicker
would
probably
have
a
field
day
in
discover
numerous
historical
and
geographical
inaccuracy
,
but
casablanca
be
still
a
shine
example
of
hollywood
ww2
movie
that
be
beliavable
,
if
not
realistic
.
any
way
,
even
if
we
do
not
see
it
as
a
historical
document
,
casablanca
be
movie
that
can
be
source
of
entertainment
as
well
as
infinite
inspiration
.
