there
be
a
striking
scene
early
in
''
city
of
angel
,
''
where
all
the
angel
who
live
unseen
in
we
midst
,
gather
at
the
beach
to
watch
the
sun
rise
.
the
camera
move
above
they
,
show
the
endless
row
of
ethereal
man
and
woman
,
all
garb
in
black
.
then
the
camera
move
in
on
the
face
of
seth
,
a
angel
play
by
nicola
cage
,
and
as
the
sun
rise
,
he
smile
and
he
entire
face
light
up
.
you
see
,
the
angel
can
hear
music
in
sunrise
and
sunset
,
but
they
can
not
feel
a
human
touch
.
it
be
a
important
scene
for
several
reason
.
first
of
all
,
it
be
one
of
many
instance
in
the
film
that
make
angel
seem
thoroughly
plausible
.
the
film
present
these
fantastic
being
as
normal-looking
people
who
drift
amongst
the
inhabitant
of
earth
,
watch
what
go
on
with
little
interference
.
there
be
none
of
the
standard
,
hokey
angel
reference
use
in
recent
film
like
''
angel
in
the
outfield
''
-lrb-
1994
-rrb-
or
''
michael
''
-lrb-
1996
-rrb-
.
the
angel
here
be
stark
and
believable
.
this
early
scene
on
the
beach
be
also
a
important
scene
of
juxtaposition
,
for
its
show
how
god
's
angel
can
enjoy
aspect
of
the
earth
that
human
can
not
,
and
yet
they
be
deny
so
many
simple
human
pleasure
,
like
feel
the
sand
on
they
foot
or
the
wave
lap
at
they
leg
,
or
the
smell
of
the
salt
in
the
air
.
there
be
a
inherent
tragedy
in
be
a
angel
,
although
there
be
much
beauty
in
it
as
well
.
they
eternally
walk
the
earth
,
listen
to
we
thought
,
touch
we
in
we
pain
,
and
lead
the
die
to
heaven
.
like
human
existence
,
be
a
angel
be
often
confused
and
unsure
.
''
city
of
angel
''
be
essentially
a
love
story
,
between
seth
and
a
human
,
a
beautiful
but
sad
heart
surgeon
name
maggie
-lrb-
meg
ryan
-rrb-
.
he
first
see
she
when
he
be
in
she
operating
room
,
wait
to
lead
the
soul
of
she
die
patient
to
heaven
.
maggie
be
distraught
,
do
everything
in
she
power
to
stop
the
man
from
die
on
she
table
,
and
seth
be
move
by
she
effort
and
,
more
importantly
,
she
overwhelming
sadness
when
the
patient
die
.
angel
have
the
limited
power
to
soothe
human
in
time
of
misery
and
pain
,
and
seth
do
what
he
can
with
he
invisible
touch
,
but
it
be
not
enough
.
he
want
to
be
with
she
and
share
she
pain
,
not
just
stand
back
at
a
distance
.
he
learn
that
the
only
way
to
fulfill
he
desire
for
human
love
and
touch
be
for
he
to
''
fall
''
and
become
human
.
he
learn
this
from
another
fall
angel
,

franz
-lrb-

p

blue
''
-rrb-
in
a
touching
and
humorous
performance
.
sit
at
a
diner
together
,
franz
tell
cage
's
character
about
how
wonderful
it
be
to
be
human
-
to
be
able
to
taste
food
,
feel
another
person
's
skin
,
smell
the
air
,
and
most
importantly
,
have
a
loving
wife
and
child
.
of
course
,
there
be
pain
to
go
along
with
all
this
,
but
for
seth
,
it
will
be
worth
it
.
''
city
of
angel
''
be
something
of
a
reinterpretation
of
wim
wender
's
haunt
1988
film
''
wing
of
desire
.
''
wender
'
film
be
more
like
a
poem
-
it
be
the
feeling
,
the
emotion
that
truly
matter
over
what
actually
happen
.
the
americanize
version
move
the
location
from
divide
berlin
to
broken
lo
angele
,
and
the
emphasis
shift
onto
the
relationship
between
the
immortal
angel
and
the
mortal
human
.
and
,
unlike
most
foreign
film
that
be
re-made
into
hollywood
fare
,
it
do
not
suffer
extensive
damage
.
this
may
be
because
director
brad
silberling
-lrb-
''
casper
''
-rrb-
and
screenwriter
dana
steven
-lrb-
''
blink
''
-rrb-
want
to
make
''
city
of
angel
''
its
own
movie
-
inspire
by
''
wing
of
desire
,
''
but
not
a
attempt
to
copy
it
.
and
yet
,
''
city
of
angel
''
be
not
a
typical
hollywood
movie
.
it
be
beautifully
film
in
lush
color
by
cinematographer
john
seale
-lrb-
''
the
english
patient
''
-rrb-
,
whose
sweeping
aerial
shot
and
golden
lighting
make
lo
angele
into
a
almost
unrecognizable
new
world
.
seale
create
many
striking
visual
:
in
addition
to
the
beach
scene
,
there
be
a
wonderful
sequence
in
a
circular
library
where
all
the
angel
appear
at
banister
all
around
,
look
down
at
seth
as
he
watch
maggie
walk
by
.
while
the
film
travel
along
a
chart
plot
,
it
take
time
to
develop
its
character
and
situation
;
it
shed
light
on
the
boundary
between
what
be
earthly
and
what
be
heavenly
,
and
show
just
how
thin
those
boundary
be
.
both
cage
and
ryan
give
soulful
,
soft-spoken
performance
.
ryan
,
who
be
usually
so
bouncy
and
energetic
,
truly
embody
a
sadness
that
can
only
be
alleviate
by
a
heavenly
touch
.
cage
project
all
he
desire
and
longing
to
be
human
in
simple
,
heartfelt
gaze
,
and
speak
with
the
comforting
,
know
voice
that
only
a
angel
could
have
.
what
be
most
striking
about
''
city
of
angel
''
be
that
steven
have
add
a
new
end
to
the
screenplay
,
which
be
both
unexpected
and
challenging
.
it
be
not
a
formulaic
hollywood
end
,
because
it
be
both
sad
and
uplifting
at
the
same
time
.
it
do
not
give
the
audience
what
it
think
it
want
at
the
end
of
a
romance
.
instead
,
it
offer
something
much
better
,
something
that
speak
to
the
depths
of
what
it
mean
to
be
human
and
alive
.
