in
the

critique
:
a
pretty
intense
little
movie
with
solid
act
across
the
board
,
some
up
,
some
downs
and
a
thrilling
end
,
despite
a
couple
of
small
flaw
.
i
really
enjoy
this
movie
because
it
follow
two
extreme
character
and
put
they
in
situation
which
have
I
wonder
about
what
i
would
do
if
i
be
in
they
place
.
the
film
get
right
into
the
''
dirty
''
side
of
,
well
...
the
dirt
on
the
street
,
and
proceed
to
teach
the
rookie
cop
-lrb-
and
we
,
the
audience
-rrb-
how
thing
really
work
down
there
.
of
course
,
we
be
receive
this
lesson
from
a
man
who
have
put
away
a
lot
of
scum
in
he
time
,
but
the
thing
he
seem
to
be
do
be
not
exactly
on
the
up-and-up
either
.
and
therein
,
lie
the
fun
of
the
film
.
do
you
agree
that
you
yourself
would
need
to
break
a
few
small
law
in
order
to
put
away
the
people
who
break
the
really
big
one
?
well
,
as
the
film
move
along
,
we
be
give
two
point
of
view
in
respect
to
this
predicament
,
and
to
I
,
both
side
make
sense
at
some
point
or
another
.
and
you
gotta
give
a
lot
of
credit
to
the
screenplay
for
that
,
the
director
,
who
build
the
film
up
wonderfully
-lrb-
with
the
darkness
of
the
day
lead
to
the
darkness
in
the
script
-rrb-
and
the
two
actor
who
deliver
they
part
in
spade
.
hawke
,
first
off
,
because
he
rarely
play
these
''
commercial
''
role
but
do
so
perfectly
here
,
with
a
vulnerable
side
which
have
you
feel
for
the
bastard
right
off
the
top
.
and
denzel
,
well
,
what
can
you
say
about
mr
.
washington
that
have
not
already
be
say
before
?
he
come
through
as
per
he
usual
high-level
style
here
,
and
give
the
audience
a
completely
different
side
to
he
talent
,
of
which
,
i
personally
would
like
to
see
more
.
he
be
nice
,
he
be
not
so
nice
,
he
be
smart
,
he
be
not
so
smart
,
he
be
care
and
he
be
a
dog
all
the
way
.
the
few
problem
that
i
do
have
with
this
film
include
the
redundant
nature
of
the
whole
thing
at
some
point
-lrb-
okay
,
we
get
it
...
you
have
to
be
nasty
in
order
to
deal
with
these
nasty
people
...
move
on
-rrb-
and
this
one
really
major
''
coincidence
''
which
involve
a
bathtub
,
that
save
the
day
for
one
character
,
but
seem
a
little
too
''
convenient
''
for
my
taste
.
i
also
never
really
understand
how
washington
's
character
get
out
of
a
certain
dire
predicament
,
only
to
be
see
drive
he
car
in
the
very
next
scene
.
but
obviously
these
small
flaw
do
not
taint
my
overall
enjoyment
of
this
tense
drama
,
a
film
that
get
you
right
into
the
street
,
into
the
nook
and
the
cranny
,
and
into
the
moral
dilemma
which
lie
between
the
justice
system
and
the
day-to-day
drug
bust
.
see
it
if
you
want
to
wrestle
with
some
of
these
issue
yourself
,
see
it
if
you
want
to
see
denzel
and
ethan
strike
up
a
palpable
chemistry
on-screen
,
and
see
it
if
you
like
hold
on
to
you
seat-handle
real
tight
during
a
movie
.
in
fact
,
see
it
for
the
scene
in
which
ethan
hawke
play
card
with
a
host
of
gang-banger
alone
...
dang
,
now
that
be
intense
!
where
's
joblo
come
from
