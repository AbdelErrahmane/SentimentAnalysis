every
once
in
a
while
,
a
film
sneak
up
on
I
and
take
I
completely
by
surprise
.
i
do
not
necessarily
mean
in
term
of
quality
;
rather
,
i
be
refer
to
the
mere
knowledge
of
its
existence
.
usually
i
know
what
film
be
on
the
way
a
year
in
advance
,
but
two
week
ago
i
have
never
hear
of
princess
caraboo
.
it
have
slip
rather
quietly
into
limited
release
,
and
appear
destine
to
slip
out
just
as
quietly
.
that
be
a
shame
,
because
princess
caraboo
be
a
delightful
fable
,
romantic
,
gentle
and
very
appealing
.
what
be
more
,
it
be
surprisingly
insightful
and
provide
a
sharp-witted
lesson
in
english
social
history
.
princess
caraboo
be
base
on
a
actual
event
in
early
19th
century
england
,
involve
a
young
woman
-lrb-
phoebe
cate
-rrb-
who
be
find
wander
the
countryside
.
apparently
unable
to
speak
any
english
,
she
be
take
in
by
good-hearted
gentlewoman
mr
.
worrall
-lrb-
wendy
hughe
-rrb-
.
she
banker
husband
-lrb-
jim
broadbent
-rrb-
be
none-too-pleased
about
this
strange
houseguest
,
until
the
worrall
begin
to
believe
that
the
woman
may
be
royalty
from
a
east
indian
island
,
the
princess
caraboo
.
this
development
inspire
plan
for
a
lucrative
trading
venture
for
mr
.
worrall
,
and
a
introduction
into
elite
social
circle
for
mr
.
worrall
.
however
,
local
journalist
john
gutch
-lrb-
stephen
rea
-rrb-
be
not
convince
that
the
woman
be
what
she
seem
to
be
,
and
set
out
to
find
out
the
truth
about
princess
caraboo
.
as
a
social
satire
and
comedy
of
manners
,
princess
caraboo
be
a
winner
.
it
take
place
in
a
era
when
it
be
common
practice
in
england
to
jail
vagrant
and
hang
beggar
,
and
that
practice
come
in
for
a
obvious
hazing
.
but
it
be
handle
most
effectively
through
the
character
of
mr
.
worrall
,
a
drunken
womanizer
whose
bank
be
in
deep
trouble
thanks
to
he
corruption
and
ineptitude
.
he
be
worse
than
one
of
the
idle
rich
;
he
be
one
of
the
actively
odious
gentry
so
eager
to
distance
themselves
from
the
lower
class
they
think
nothing
of
simply
eliminate
they
,
and
since
the
house
and
money
be
all
from
mr
.
worrall
,
he
be
a
bit
too
close
to
they
for
comfort
.
while
hypocrisy
be
a
easy
target
for
ridicule
,
director
and
co-writer
michael
austin
keep
the
treatment
too
light-hearted
to
be
heavy-handed
.
he
also
take
a
unique
stab
at
the
trendiness
of
the
upper
class
,
as
the
princess
become
a
''
sensation
''
at
court
.
in
one
of
the
film
's
best
sequence
,
princess
caraboo
be
the
guest
of
honor
at
a
party
host
by
the
prince
regent
-lrb-
a
wonderfully
foppish
turn
by
comic
john
session
-rrb-
,
and
the
lord
and
lady
end
up
follow
she
around
in
a
thoroughly
silly
native
dance
.
it
be
then
that
princess
caraboo
show
how
easily
people
be
sweep
up
in
''
sensation
,
''
a
idea
that
take
on
a
timeless
quality
-lrb-
and
make
the
film
a
interesting
companion
piece
to
the
current
quiz
show
-rrb-
.
social
commentary
aside
,
princess
caraboo
be
simply
a
eminently
enjoyable
entertainment
.
the
performer
be
mostly
delightful
,
particularly
phoebe
cate
,
who
be
radiant
in
a
part
that
require
a
gift
for
pantomime
.
she
supporting
player
be
also
appeal
:
wendy
hughe
as
the
patient
and
kindly
mr
.
worrall
;
kevin
kline
as
frixo
,
the
worrall
'
suspicious
and
superior
greek
butler
;
stephen
rea
as
the
world-weary
but
ultimately
romantic
gutch
.
only
john
lithgow
be
a
disappointment
,
turn
in
a
limp
performance
as
a
scholar
who
attempt
to
verify
the
princess
's
identity
.
the
story
twist
and
turn
just
enough
so
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
princess
be
really
a
princess
be
always
in
some
doubt
,
without
become
gimmicky
.
it
be
unfortunate
that
the
grow
attraction
between
gutch
and
princess
caraboo
be
not
give
more
time
to
develop
,
because
the
potential
seem
to
be
there
.
when
it
finally
do
blossom
,
it
seem
too
quick
to
be
plausible
.
princess
caraboo
be
patient
enough
in
establish
its
sense
of
time
and
place
that
it
might
seem
a
bit
slow
to
viewer
seek
a
fantasy
romp
.
still
,
it
have
both
escapist
and
intellectual
appeal
,
and
be
well
worth
seek
out
.
it
be
the
kind
of
film
that
make
my
job
its
most
rewarding
--
a
hidden
gem
.
