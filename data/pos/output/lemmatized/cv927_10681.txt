comparison
to
''
seven
year

be
inevitable
.
both
film
cover
much
of
the
same
ground

the
earlier

so
from
a
westerner

point
of
view

''

''
feature
only
native
actor
and
be
more
of
a
insider
's
story
.
in
some
way
,
this
make
this
film
a
superior
concept
,
but
it
lack
the
movement
and
spark
that
make
''

such
a
audience-pleaser
.

contribute
to
the
realistic
feel
of

the
only
disappointment
be
chairman
mao
who
look
like
a
wax
dummy
and
move
as
if
he
be
a
computer-generated
character

on
a
intellectual
level
,
it
be
interesting
to
see
how
two
different
approach
handle
the
same
fact
.
some
event

differently

the
problem
with

at
here

''
we
be
just
about
to

after

the
film
be
magnificently
beautiful
thanks
primarily
to
the
cinematography
of
roger

.
he

show
the
exotic
tibetan
culture

especially
striking

the

more
than

create
a
poetic
meditation
for

something

to

,
this
be
he

film

oddly
enough
for
a
director
with
a
history
of
graphic
violence
present
a
history
fill
with
atrocity
by
the

,
most
of

in

as
grand
as
it
look
and
as
historically
accurate
as
it
be
,
there
be
a
distance
between
the
audience
and
the
movie
.
the
film
be
more
concerned
with
visual
and
history
and
less
so
with
human
being
.
with
the
exception
of
a
few
scene
,
involvement
with
the
character
be
slight
.
one
of
those
exception
be
the
portrayal
of
the
young
dalaus
lama
,
show
as
a
mischievous
boy
who
can
not

be
a
outstanding
moment
,
but
there
be
not
many
of
these
.
even
with
its
problem
,
the
''
kundun
''
experience
be
phenomenal
,
but
one
that
i
fear
most
will
miss
.
many
people
who
see
''
seven

''
will
have
a

do

attitude

it
be
likely
that
the
film
will
miss
a
wide-spread
appeal
and
public
response
will
be
the
sound
of
one
