here
be
a
film
that
be
so
unexpected
,
so
scary
,
and
so
original
that
it
catch
I
off
guard
and
throw
I
for
a
loop
.
okay
,
it
be
not
quite
original
,
consider
it
be
a
sequel
to
the
box
office
hit
species
,
but
it
certainly
be
smart
.
most
film
of
this
genre
be
reminiscent
of
those
cheesy
b-horror
film
from
the
50s
and
60
,
and
some
even
become
they
.
however
,
as
we
learn
with
the
1995
small-budget
horror\/sci-fus
film
,
sometimes
expectation
can
be
shatter
.
a
lot
of
criticism
have
go
against
this
film
-lrb-
from
what
i
have
read
so
far
,
anyway
--
yep
,
all
two
review
-rrb-
,
and
it
make
I
wonder
why
these
type
of
film
be
automatically
dismiss
as
gory
,
laughable
piece
of
trash
.
but
,
the
thing
be
,
it
be
not
.
it
be
well
make
,
well
act
,
and
quite
intelligent
.
i
can
see
most
of
the
critic
now
complain
about
the
level
of
gore
or
the
level
of
sexuality
in
the
film
.
but
the
species
series
be
not
about
the
lack
of
these
element
.
it
be
about
how
much
it
can
get
into
one
film
.
and
yet
,
behind
it
all
,
it
have
this
basic
premise
that
allow
it
to
get
away
with
do
so
.
species
ii
begin
in
the
present
day
,
though
it
seem
to
be
a
alternate
universe
.
many
film
-lrb-
especially
sci-fi
one
-rrb-
create
similar
timeline
as
we
realistic
one
,
but
change
it
to
fit
the
film
's
need
.
species
ii
begin
with
the
arrival
of
a
american
spacecraft
,
the
excursion
,
landing
on
the
surface
of
mar
.
aboard
be
patrick
ross
-lrb-
justin
lazard
-rrb-
,
a
very
bright
and
very
handsome
astronaut
.
patrick
be
the
son
of
senator
ross
-lrb-
jame
cromwell
-rrb-
,
who
just
want
patrick
to
succeed
.
well
,
it
would
seem
that
he
have
succeed
.
landing
on
the
surface
of
mar
,
he
be
the
first
human
be
to
ever
do
so
.
of
course
,
he
be
not
the
first
ever
.
about
a
billion
year
ago
,
a
alien
species
supposedly
land
on
mar
and
destroy
the
perfect
living
condition
that
be
able
to
sustain
life
.
now
,
of
course
,
the
red
planet
be
cold
and
rocky
.
no
life
live
on
it
.
that
be
,
no
visible
life
.
patrick
,
upon
leave
the
spacecraft
and
landing
on
the
red
soil
,
collect
sample
from
the
ground
.
he
take
they
aboard
,
and
put
they
in
storage
.
unfortunately
,
one
of
the
sample
contain
a
form
of
life
,
and
it
get
loose
when
it
be
heated
aboard
the
ship
.
just
prior
to
head
back
to
earth
,
this
life
form
creep
along
the
floor
and
inhabit
the
earthling
.
they
pass
out
for
approximately
seven
minute
,
and
then
shrug
it
off
as
nothing
,
because
they
can
not
even
remember
.
they
blame
it
on
a
technical
malfunction
.
back
on
earth
,
patrick
begin
to
have
strong
urge
to
mate
with
as
many
woman
as
possible
.
as
we
know
from
the
original
,
this
be
because
the
alien
want
to
breed
and
take
over
the
planet
.
however
,
the
child
that
be
breed
be
half-human
,
as
they
father
be
.
patrick
be
really
look
for
another
alien
to
breed
with
,
and
he
find
it
in
eve
-lrb-
natasha
henstridge
-rrb-
.
eve
be
clone
from
dna
take
from
sil
,
the
original
alien
.
however
,
this
time
around
,
most
of
she
''
alien
''
urge
have
be
either
decrease
dramatically
,
or
lie
dormant
.
the
project
be
lead
by
dr
.
laura
baker
-lrb-
marg
helgenberger
,
reprise
she
role
from
species
-rrb-
,
and
she
motive
seem
respectable
.
since
she
be
involve
with
the
original
alien
attack
,
she
want
to
learn
how
to
stop
the
alien
should
it
come
again
.
and
it
have
.
story-wise
,
species
ii
be
much
stronger
than
its
predecessor
,
but
it
be
also
much
stronger
than
,
say
,
alien
-lrb-
hey
,
i
love
the
film
,
but
you
can
not
tell
I
it
be
strong
on
story
-rrb-
.
what
surprised
I
the
most
with
this
film
be
the
incorporation
of
historical
fact
into
the
screenplay
.
in
my
search
for
extraterrestrial
intelligence
course
in
college
,
we
learn
about
a
piece
of
rock
from
mar
which
land
in
one
of
the
pole
.
this
piece
of
rock
contain
fossil
which
may
have
be
proof
of
life
on
mar
-lrb-
later
,
it
be
prove
that
it
be
not
a
living
creature
that
create
it
-rrb-
.
the
script
use
this
effectively
,
but
also
manage
to
provide
a
well-balanced
plot
.
begin
with
the
first
man
on
mar
-lrb-
something
i
have
always
dream
of
see
-rrb-
,
i
be
hope
that
the
film
would
turn
this
element
into
a
useful
start
point
for
the
movie
.
and
it
do
it
quite
well
.
the
character
be
all
smart
,
and
they
know
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
.
the
only
character
that
seem
a
little
cliched
be
the
general
-lrb-
george
dzundza
-rrb-
,
and
yet
,
he
remain
logical
in
everything
he
do
.
there
be
the
obvious
flaw
of
course
,
mostly
lie
in
the
technical
aspect
.
the
special
effect
be
only
mediocre
,
and
some
be
just
plain
bad
.
but
for
the
most
part
,
they
remain
believable
-lrb-
i
even
notice
a
homage
to
the
alien
series
when
the
mother
give
birth
to
alien
child
-rrb-
.
also
,
the
most
realistic
one
be
usually
the
goriest
,
range
from
people
be
tear
open
,
or
someone
's
head
be
blow
off
.
however
,
some
plot
element
also
may
elicit
laugh
from
the
audience
,
include
a
menage
a
trous
that
be
all
but
necessary
.
many
people
dislike
the
species
series
because
all
it
be
be
a
excuse
for
sex
,
nudity
,
and
gory
violence
.
however
,
i
tend
to
disagree
.
what
be
the
alien
film
about
?
and
,
if
a
alien
species
ever
do
come
to
earth
,
and
they
sole
purpose
be
to
destroy
we
,
would
not
you
mate
as
quickly
as
possible
with
as
many
people
as
possible
?
my
only
gripe
with
this
be
during
the
scene
where
patrick
go
search
for
a
mate
in
a
grocery
store
.
i
do
not
realize
that
alien
be
that
picky
on
choose
woman
to
mate
with
-lrb-
i
just
assume
it
be
he
part-human
side
look
for
the
most
beautiful
one
-rrb-
.
the
acting
be
quite
good
for
this
kind
of
film
.
it
be
a
vast
improvement
over
the
first
film
,
at
least
.
the
acting
be
the
key
element
to
this
film
:
if
it
be
bad
,
it
would
have
lower
itself
into
camp
;
if
it
be
good
,
it
would
have
ask
for
comparison
with
film
like
alien
.
okay
,
so
it
be
not
that
good
.
george
dzundza
be
probably
the
most
obvious
mistake
on
casting
,
as
he
over-the-top
impersonation
of
a
general
make
he
annoying
and
distracting
.
natasha
henstridge
be
limit
this
time
around
,
as
she
be
usually
enclose
in
a
cage
.
however
,
she
do
manage
a
very
impressive
performance
with
this
aspect
hinder
any
of
she
talent
.
oh
yeah
,
and
she
be
quite
fun
to
just
plain
watch
.
marg
helgenberger
be
immensely
better
this
time
around
,
and
she
performance
be
probably
the
best
in
this
film
.
michael
madsen
be
so-so
,
but
he
be
not
annoying
,
and
he
soon
become
rather
appealing
-lrb-
with
he
nice
cynic
personality
-rrb-
.
jame
cromwell
have
a
small
part
,
but
he
make
it
much
better
than
what
it
could
have
be
with
a
more
incapable
actor
.
as
i
say
,
any
film
with
jame
cromwell
dramatically
increase
in
likeability
.
mykeltus
williamson
give
a
enjoyable
performance
,
and
he
give
the
film
a
more
down-to-earth
feel
.
and
,
of
course
,
justin
lazard
.
lazard
have
so
far
be
ridicule
for
he
performance
,
but
i
think
he
be
effective
.
sure
,
he
be
wooden
,
but
be
not
that
what
he
character
be
like
?
the
moment
when
he
touch
the
glass
separate
henstridge
from
he
be
extremely
well
do
,
due
to
the
couple
's
acting
.
species
ii
be
rate
r
for
strong
sexuality
,
sci-fi
violence\/gore
and
language
.
this
be
definitely
a
r
rate
film
that
young
kid
should
not
see
.
more
than
likely
,
they
would
probably
have
nightmare
and
never
have
sex
for
the
rest
of
they
life
.
hell
,
i
do
not
even
know
if
i
will
.
what
be
sure
to
be
a
critically
lambast
film
turn
out
to
be
the
surprise
film
of
the
year
.
i
probably
will
not
see
another
film
where
i
be
expect
so
little
and
get
so
much
for
quite
a
while
.
director
peter
medak
have
craft
a
very
suspenseful
,
and
sometimes
very
scary
movie
out
of
a
mediocre
series
.
medak
have
also
master
the
wonderful
''
jump
!
''
moment
,
and
have
probably
the
second
scariest
moment
i
have
ever
see
on
film
-lrb-
scream
still
have
the
first
-rrb-
.
strong
acting
,
smart
dialogue
,
intelligent
plot
,
and
a
sure-handed
director
,
species
ii
be
exactly
what
these
film
should
be
:
entertaining
.
