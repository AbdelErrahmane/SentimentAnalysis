when
i
first
hear
about
scream
in
1996
,
i
be
tell
that
it
be
a
spoof
of
horror
movie
.
from
the
master
of
the
horror
himself
,
we
craven
,
it
ridicule
the
cliche
of
the
genre
by
overemphasize
they
,
by
make
the
teenager
do
what
they
know
they
be
not
suppose
to
do
when
a
serial
killer
be
stalk
they
-lrb-
do
not
run
up
the
stair
when
you
can
easily
go
out
the
front
door
,
never
say
''
i
'll
be
right
back
,
''
etc
.
-rrb-
.
when
i
first
hear
this
description
,
i
figure
that
it
be
a
easy
way
out
of
make
a
bad
movie
.
how
hard
be
it
to
make
a
extremely
terrible
film
but
claim
it
be
actually
a
mockery
of
other
bad
movie
.
be
this
we
craven
's
remedy
from
make
''
real
''
bad
movie
such
as
vampire
in
brooklyn
?
it
just
seem
cheap
to
I
.
then
i
actually
see
the
movie
and
the
first
twenty
minute
,
involve
draw
barrymore
and
a
nail-bitingly
intense
phone
conversation
,
completely
change
my
attitude
.
scream
be
not
only
a
clever
parody
of
you
standard
horror
flick
,
it
be
also
a
pretty
scary
movie
.
if
you
have
see
a
million
of
these
kind
of
film
,
you
know
exactly
what
be
go
to
happen
.
this
be
part
of
the
fun
of
watch
scream
.
the
movie
remind
avid
horror
fan
how
similar
and
repetitive
the
genre
be
and
it
also
remind
they
how
great
a
guilty
pleasure
it
can
be
to
watch
pointless
and
predictable
violence
to
innocent
,
attractive
teenager
.
to
those
who
rarely
see
these
type
of
movie
,
scream
be
a
thrilling
unpredictable
ride
that
could
be
mistake
as
a
serious
slasher
film
.
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
that
misjudgment
though
.
i
have
witness
viewer
from
both
side
of
the
audience
,
the
newby
to
horror
and
the
fanatic
.
they
opinion
on
the
film
be
so
different
but
both
very
positive
.
from
these
varied
review
,
i
be
convince
that
scream
have
not
only
revive
the
teen
horror
movie
and
the
normal
teen
romance
movie
but
also
the
hilarious
parody
of
these
and
other
category
.
film
that
both
deride
and
celebrate
genre
like
galaxy
quest
and
the
big
hit
would
not
have
exist
,
in
my
opinion
,
if
it
be
not
for
the
outstanding
success
of
scream
.
the
low
-
budget
1996
gem
may
,
alongside
pulp
fiction
,
be
the
most
influential
film
of
the
1990
's
.
this
influence
may
exist
to
the
chagrin
of
some
moviegoer
who
despise
movie
like
teaching
mr
.
tingle
or
television
program
such
as
dawson
's
creek
but
to
other
such
as
myself
,
we
congratulate
the
movie
that
have
open
new
door
for
excellent
young
actor
,
screenwriter
,
and
director
.
scream
be
also
a
extremely
funny
movie
thanks
to
its
quickly-paced
script
by
kevin
williamson
.
within
the
film
be
character
who
tell
other
character
,
as
well
as
the
audience
,
the
basic
rule
and
cliche
of
a
horror
movie
.
mainly
from
the
rant
of
randy
-lrb-
jamie
kennedy
-rrb-
and
stu
-lrb-
matthew
lillard
-rrb-
,
we
be
remind
not
only
of
the
obvious
and
hilarious
rule
but
also
some
of
the
more
subtle
stereotype
that
when
think
over
be
mostly
true
as
well
-lrb-
the
virgin
always
survive
;
have
sex
and
you
be
dead
meat
-rrb-
.
not
only
be
we
treat
these
rule
on
a
plate
but
also
the
rule
be
reference
to
a
number
of
different
film
and
actor
.
the
script
feel
like
a
obsessive
essay
from
a
college
film
geek
who
have
nothing
better
to
do
but
find
every
little
blunder
from
every
little
film
for
he
own
self-satisfaction
.
in
this
case
,
williamson
find
these
error
for
the
audience
's
satisfaction
and
amusement
.
i
hear
there
be
a
new
movie
come
out
call
scary
movie
which
be
a
spoof
of
scream
,
which
be
a
spoof
of
scary
movie
.
i
will
certainly
see
the
film
but
i
have
the
feeling
that
this
parody
will
be
more
obviously
ridicule
the
genre
rather
than
scream
's
perfect
subtlety
.
however
my
last
gut
feeling
about
this
stuff
,
scream
,
be
dead
wrong
...
so
who
know
.
