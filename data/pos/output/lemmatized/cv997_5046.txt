glory
--
star
matthew
broderick
,
denzel
washington
,
and
morgan
freeman
--
be
the
true
story
of
the
54th
regiment
of
massachusett
,
the
first
black
fighting
unit
recruit
by
the
north
during
the
civil
war
.
broderick
play
robert
gould
shaw
,
the
young
white
officer
who
lead
the
black
soldier
into
battle
.
shaw
,
the
son
of
well-to-do
abolitionist
,
hail
from
boston
high
society
.
the
letter
he
write
home
to
he
parent
during
the
war
be
on
display
at
harvard
,
and
be
,
evidently
,
the
inspiration
for
glory
.
as
the
film
begin
in
1862
,
shaw
be
a
captain
in
the
northern
force
.
like
private
eriksson
-lrb-
michael
j
.
fox
-rrb-
in
casualty
of
war
,
shaw
initially
be
naive
and
idealistic
about
the
war
--
that
be
,
until
he
company
be
attack
by
enemy
force
.
shaw
experience
first
hand
the
horror
and
chaos
of
battle
,
witness
mass
slaughter
and
receive
a
minor
wound
himself
when
a
bullet
graze
he
neck
.
soon
after
he
recovery
,
shaw
be
promote
to
colonel
and
assign
to
enlist
and
train
black
in
the
war
effort
.
glory
be
the
story
not
only
of
colonel
shaw
,
but
also
of
the
black
soldier
who
lay
down
they
life
to
free
they
brother
from
slavery
.
the
film
periodically
jump
between
shaw
's
point
of
view
and
the
perspective
of
the
black
soldier
.
the
movie
introduce
we
to
a
handful
of
black
recruit
,
and
we
follow
they
from
they
enlistment
through
basic
training
and
finally
into
action
.
the
large
black
cast
be
uniformly
outstanding
,
especially
washington
who
be
electrifying
as
a
runaway
slave
with
a
big
mouth
.
he
be
brash
and
pushy
,
always
get
into
trouble
and
always
look
for
a
fight
.
he
bitter
,
tough
guy
facade
be
really
just
a
mask
for
he
loneliness
and
vulnerability
.
washington
provide
much
of
the
film
's
intensity
and
emotional
power
.
in
one
heartbreaking
scene
,
he
be
whip
for
allegedly
desert
the
army
.
when
he
remove
he
shirt
to
receive
the
punishment
,
you
cringe
at
the
sight
of
he
back
,
which
be
riddled
with
ugly
scar
from
he
day
as
a
slave
.
it
make
you
blood
boil
.
the
humiliation
of
the
beating
be
far
more
traumatic
than
the
actual
physical
pain
it
bring
;
a
tear
roll
down
washington
's
cheek
--
and
will
probably
run
down
you
cheek
as
well
.
the
episode
become
even
more
tragic
when
we
learn
that
washington
be
not
desert
the
army
at
all
;
he
leave
camp
to
look
for
shoe
because
he
foot
be
cover
with
ooze
sore
.
freeman
be
,
as
usual
,
a
strong
presence
,
even
in
a
small
support
role
.
he
play
a
grave
digger
who
have
bury
more
white
soldier
than
he
care
to
remember
.
he
quickly
become
a
leader
among
the
black
soldier
,
hold
the
group
together
and
serve
as
a
liaison
to
the
white
officer
.
colonel
shaw
recognize
freeman
's
leadership
ability
and
promote
he
to
sergeant
major
,
make
he
the
first
black
officer
in
the
army
.
andre
braugher
make
a
impressive
film
debut
in
the
role
of
thoma
searle
,
a
free
black
who
be
one
of
shaw
's
close
childhood
friend
.
searle
be
educate
and
refine
,
like
a
white
man
,
prompt
washington
to
nickname
he
''
snow
flake
.
''
the
burn
question
be
whether
searle
be
tough
enough
to
survive
basic
training
and
to
kill
in
combat
.
the
road
from
march
drill
to
battle
action
be
a
bumpy
one
for
the
black
regiment
.
the
soldier
suffer
innumerable
hardship
,
but
somehow
they
never
lose
they
morale
.
the
army
treat
the
black
soldier
like
second
class
citizen
,
subject
they
to
racism
and
discrimination
.
they
be
pay
only
$
10
a
month
,
whereas
they
white
counterpart
earn
thirteen
,
and
,
for
a
long
time
,
they
have
to
go
without
shoe
,
gun
,
or
uniform
.
to
make
matter
worse
,
the
white
military
hierarchy
be
extremely
reluctant
to
allow
the
black
into
action
,
prefer
instead
to
use
they
for
manual
labor
.
eventually
,
however
,
the
regiment
receive
its
boot
,
uniform
,
rifle
,
and
right
to
fight
,
thanks
to
the
stubborn
resolve
of
colonel
shaw
.
shaw
have
absolute
faith
in
he
soldier
,
and
he
fight
tooth
and
nail
to
get
they
what
they
deserve
,
even
if
it
mean
threaten
a
general
with
blackmail
.
broderick
,
in
fact
,
be
most
convincing
in
the
scene
where
shaw
stand
up
for
the
regiment
.
unfortunately
,
however
,
broderick
's
uneven
performance
be
,
in
many
respects
,
the
weak
link
in
the
movie
.
in
a
effort
to
look
more
mature
,
broderick
sport
a
mustache
and
a
goatee
,
and
throughout
the
film
he
slip
in
and
out
of
a
phony
boston
accent
.
he
be
never
altogether
convincing
as
shaw
since
much
of
the
time
he
emotion
seem
force
.
the
film
place
too
much
weight
on
broderick
's
character
and
not
enough
on
the
black
soldier
,
who
be
more
intriguing
.
glory
regain
lose
ground
with
its
harrowing
depiction
of
war
.
the
movie
show
the
devastation
of
war
without
resort
to
the
unnecessarily
graphic
gore
which
mar
bear
on
the
fourth
of
July
.
glory
do
not
try
to
rattle
you
with
nauseating
blood
and
gut
.
except
for
a
few
bullet
wound
and
one
explode
head
,
the
film
,
for
the
most
part
,
leave
the
gore
to
you
imagination
,
which
be
not
to
say
that
the
battle
scene
in
glory
be
timid
.
to
the
contrary
,
they
be
chaotic
and
horrifying
;
it
be
just
that
director
edward
zwick
-lrb-
the
co-creator
of
''
thirtysomething
''
-rrb-
film
they
with
far
more
subtlety
and
restraint
than
oliver
stone
could
ever
muster
.
the
key
to
glory
be
the
group
dynamic
among
the
black
soldier
.
the
movie
depict
some
of
-lrb-
but
not
enough
of
-rrb-
they
custom
and
ritual
.
in
one
scene
,
for
example
,
the
soldier
motivate
themselves
by
singing
prayer
around
the
campfire
.
each
man
have
a
chance
to
relay
a
few
word
of
inspiration
.
a
couple
of
the
movie
's
most
touching
moment
involve
young
black
child
look
up
to
the
black
soldier
with
awe
,
disbelief
and
pride
.
the
regiment
's
greatest
triumph
come
when
the
soldier
distinguish
themselves
in
battle
,
thereby
earn
the
respect
of
they
white
peer
and
earn
the
honor
of
lead
the
climactic
assault
on
fort
wagner
.
like
any
war
film
,
glory
have
its
share
of
gloom
and
despair
,
but
ultimately
it
prove
to
be
a
truly
uplifting
experience
and
a
important
history
lesson
,
a
valuable
reminder
that
despite
what
the
history
book
say
-lrb-
or
,
more
precisely
,
what
they
do
not
say
-rrb-
,
black
play
a
critically
important
role
in
the
north
's
victory
over
the
south
--
forever
change
the
evolution
of
america
.
