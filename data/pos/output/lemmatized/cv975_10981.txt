martin
scorsese
's
film
use
to
intimidate
I
.
because
of
he
reputation
,
i
feel
obligate
to
appreciate
they
as
deep
film
art
rather
than
as
great
flick
.
as
much
as
i
enjoy
they
,
i
usually
feel
like
i
miss
something
.
i
learn
from
scorsese
's
casino
that
whatever
technique
he
use
be
merely
there
to
enhance
the
story
.
no
mystical
interpretation
be
require
to
appreciate
he
movie
.
for
example
,
in
casino
he
use
subtitle
when
robert
deniro
and
joe
pescus
be
use
code
word
with
each
other
.
there
be
no
meaning
more
exotic
than
that
subtitle
be
the
most
succinct
way
for
he
to
tell
the
audience
what
be
really
go
on
.
or
toward
the
end
,
when
he
use
three
quick
dissolve
to
compress
a
scene
of
a
car
backing
away
from
a
building
.
again
,
the
simple
,
mundane
explanation
be
that
it
help
the
pacing
.
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
technique
be
not
creative
or
good-looking
.
but
he
simply
use
the
best
tool
for
the
job
.
it
should
not
have
surprise
I
,
then
,
that
kundun
,
a
film
about
a
mystical
religion
,
actually
turn
out
to
be
quite
straightforward
.
the
movie
follow
the
life
of
the
14th
dalaus
lama
,
the
spiritual
and
political
leader
of
tibet
.
the
movie
's
title
be
another
name
for
the
dalaus
lama
which
mean
''
ocean
of
wisdom
.
''
he
story
be
tell
in
strict
chronological
order
and
there
be
only
a
few
cinematic
vision
to
embellish
the
literal
story
.
-lrb-
one
of
which
make
a
interesting
statement
:
pay
attention
to
the
film
's
opening
shot
and
watch
where
it
be
repeat
.
-rrb-
we
first
glimpse
the
dalaus
lama
when
he
be
two
year
old
.
he
curiosity
and
self-assuredness
capture
the
attention
of
a
monk
wander
in
search
of
the
new
lama
.
a
test
be
arrange
to
see
if
this
boy
really
be
the
reincarnation
of
the
13
dalaus
lama
who
have
go
before
.
several
item
belong
to
the
previous
dalai
lama
be
lay
before
the
boy
alongside
some
other
item
.
the
child
be
ask
if
he
recognize
any
of
the
item
as
he
own
.
the
boy
pick
correctly
,
prove
that
he
be
the
new
,
and
the
old
,
dalai
lama
.
scorsese
and
long-time
editor
thelma
schoonmaker
be
kind
enough
to
allow
the
possibility
that
the
child
be
take
he
cue
from
the
monk
.
before
select
a
item
,
he
would
look
at
the
monk
,
perhaps
for
some
sort
of
confirmation
.
sometimes
he
pick
right
the
first
time
,
and
sometimes
he
make
a
second
choice
.
either
way
,
whether
through
reincarnation
or
quick
human
perception
,
the
tibetan
be
assure
of
choose
a
boy
who
could
be
a
wise
,
perceptive
leader
.
-rrb-
from
this
point
on
,
the
boy
be
raise
as
the
reincarnation
of
the
lama
's
spirit
and
the
future
leader
of
a
nation
.
it
be
a
great
weight
to
put
on
the
mind
of
a
child
.
in
the
u
.
s
.
it
might
be
grounds
for
a
call
to
social
service
.
but
the
young
lama
accept
he
destiny
without
any
apparent
emotional
damage
.
neither
the
great
power
nor
the
awesome
responsibility
keep
he
from
become
a
genuinely
likeable
,
well-rounded
person
.
certain
pattern
take
shape
over
the
year
.
for
example
,
the
dalaus
lama
be
fascinate
by
technology
.
radio
,
clock
,
and
telescope
be
some
of
he
favorite
toy
.
when
he
be
old
enough
to
accept
he
leadership
,
he
make
plan
to
modernize
isolate
tibet
.
he
also
have
a
soft
spot
for
creature
who
be
suffer
or
in
pain
,
include
herd
animal
.
it
be
nearly
a
run
gag
that
he
will
buy
sheep
to
keep
they
from
be
herd
to
slaughter
.
but
the
most
ominous
constant
throughout
he
life
be
the
presence
and
threat
of
tibet
's
gigantic
neighbor
,
china
.
tibet
and
its
leader
prove
correct
in
fear
china
,
as
,
first
the
propaganda
,
then
the
political
pressure
,
and
finally
the
army
,
come
across
they
common
border
.
the
chinese
invasion
be
so
successful
that
the
lama
's
life
be
in
danger
if
he
stay
.
the
movie
end
when
,
after
much
agonizing
,
the
dalaus
lama
leave
tibet
for
indium
.
the
story
do
not
lead
up
to
a
cinematic
climax
as
strongly
as
most
feature
film
do
.
it
just
do
not
fit
that
mold
.
if
it
be
force
into
such
a
shape
it
would
have
be
a
completely
different
movie
-lrb-
perhaps
more
like
seven
year
in
tibet
,
which
be
good
in
its
own
right
-rrb-
.
the
pacing
of
kundun
be
more
calm
and
level
than
that
.
the
structure
of
the
film
be
make
to
fit
the
character
and
event
,
not
vice-versa
.
perhaps
because
the
pace
be
slower
,
we
have
more
time
to
notice
the
beautiful
art
,
vestment
,
and
architecture
of
tibet
.
a
mandalum
,
-lrb-
tibetan
sand
painting
-rrb-
with
beautiful
,
vibrant
color
be
show
throughout
the
movie
.
the
robe
and
hat
of
state
be
bright
red
and
gold
.
the
brick
be
a
rich
reddish
brown
,
not
unlike
the
skin
tone
of
the
tibetan
.
even
the
touchstone
picture
logo
before
the
movie
-lrb-
which
be
usually
light
blue
-rrb-
be
the
red
and
gold
of
tibet
.
philip
glass
compose
the
music
for
kundun
,
and
he
be
the
perfect
choice
.
for
those
who
do
not
know
of
glass
,
he
music
be
like
a
tibetan
mandalum
.
he
building
block
be
lot
of
small
note
,
tiny
grain
of
music
,
which
be
first
group
,
then
repeat
in
pattern
.
these
pattern
create
interesting
texture
which
be
themselves
part
of
a
larger
composition
.
people
will
not
be
flock
to
kundun
for
it
be
great
end
,
or
talk
about
its
outstanding
plot
,
but
it
do
have
a
lot
to
offer
:
a
interesting
lifetime
,
exotic
sight
,
rich
cinematography
,
and
innovative
music
.
it
give
interesting
insight
into
tibetan
buddhism
and
take
a
warm
look
at
the
dalaus
lama
as
a
person
.
on
top
of
it
all
be
the
cinematic
mastery
of
martin
scorsese
,
who
give
the
film
a
strong
,
beautiful
,
consistent
look
.
