i
can
hear
the
question
already
.
what
on
earth
do
these
two
movie
have
in
common
?
to
most
people
,
not
a
lot
,
except
that
both
be
by
renowned
director
.
as
i
see
they
,
however
,
both
movie
have
flaw
romantic
script
wrap
in
distinctive
packaging
of
lavish
visual
musical
number
.
but
oh
,
how
differently
the
package
affect
they
film
.
while
''
everyone
's
''
production
number
make
a
otherwise
ordinary
woody
tale
something
special
,
jane
campion
's
imaginative
visual
only
serve
to
emphasize
how
pompous
and
uninvolving
laura
jone
'
script
be
.
i
leave
''
everyone
say
i
love
you
''
not
remember
a
lot
about
who
love
whom
,
but
its
infectious
happiness
put
a
grin
on
my
face
.
i
leave
''
the
portrait
of
a
lady
''
not
remember
a
lot
about
who
love
whom
,
and
i
could
have
care
less
.
''
everyone
''
feature
nothing
allen
have
not
do
before
storywise
.
woody
be
again
desperately
in
love
with
a
beautiful
woman
-lrb-
robert
-rrb-
,
and
against
the
odds
they
manage
to
click
for
awhile
before
allen
be
leave
wonder
what
go
wrong
--
again
.
similar
situation
happen
to
he
family
and
friend
.
some
of
the
more
outlandish
comedy
scene
even
hark
back
to
he
''
early
,
funny
''
film
.
the
scene
between
tim
roth
and
draw
barrymore
could
have
come
out
of
''
take
the
money
and
run
,
''
he
directorial
debut
.
however
,
nothing
allen
have
ever
do
prepared
I
for
this
one-of-a-kind
display
of
sheer
good
spirit
.
in
fact
,
in
this
movie
,
the
feeling
itself
be
what
be
most
important
.
yes
,
the
movie
would
have
be
better
--
among
he
very
best
,
i
think
--
if
it
have
a
meatier
story
.
but
what
it
lack
in
substance
it
make
up
for
in
feeling
.
and
what
better
way
to
express
feeling
than
through
music
?
love
be
often
best
express
in
a
song
,
and
the
number
the
cast
break
into
here
cut
straight
to
the
heart
.
some
be
a
tad
too
goofy
,
such
as
the
number
where
a
lot
of
ghost
prance
around
in
a
funeral
parlor
,
but
i
admire
allen
for
even
put
they
in
there
.
it
also
help
that
as
usual
,
allen
have
a
top-flight
cast
work
with
he
.
they
singing
voice
range
from
quite
good
-lrb-
goldie
hawn
-rrb-
to
not
quite
good
-lrb-
allen
-rrb-
to
literally
unlistenable
-lrb-
barrymore
,
whose
real
voice
be
dub
by
a
professional
-rrb-
.
but
while
they
vocal
ability
differ
,
all
the
actor
do
a
great
job
of
put
joy
up
there
on
the
screen
,
and
make
it
rub
off
on
the
audience
.
grant
,
some
people
will
simply
never
accept
character
singing
in
movie
,
but
for
those
attuned
to
it
,
this
film
should
work
wonder
.
jane
campion
,
too
,
have
a
top-flight
cast
work
for
she
in
''
portrait
of
a
lady
,
''
too
,
but
even
they
considerable
skill
can
do
nothing
to
keep
the
film
from
be
a
stilted
,
virtually
lifeless
mess
,
albeit
a
visually
interesting
one
.
campion
and
she
cinematographer
stuart
dryburgh
come
up
with
a
great
variety
of
eye-filling
image
that
linger
in
the
mind
.
unfortunately
,
what
do
not
linger
in
the
mind
for
I
be
the
story
the
visual
be
suppose
to
be
reflect
.
i
remember
very
well
shot
of
a
train
with
its
light
beam
and
shot
of
man
vanish
around
nicole
kidman
,
but
i
can
remember
very
little
of
what
happen
between
all
these
people
.
even
worse
,
i
do
not
find
myself
feel
bad
that
i
have
forget
.
the
problem
,
i
think
,
lie
not
with
the
cast
,
which
seem
to
be
try
very
hard
for
the
material
.
it
be
the
script
that
could
not
convince
I
to
care
about
anyone
.
the
character
be
put
out
all
kind
of
emotion
,
but
i
find
no
reason
to
connect
with
any
of
they
.
i
understand
that
the
story
be
about
cold
,
emotionally
vacant
character
,
but
for
I
to
care
about
they
,
i
have
to
identify
with
they
somehow
and
want
they
to
inject
feeling
into
they
life
.
jone
'
script
never
simply
give
I
that
opportunity
.
in
the
end
,
it
almost
seem
as
if
campion
be
try
to
inject
some
life
of
she
own
into
the
proceedings
with
she
visual
flourish
.
unfortunately
,
as
she
keep
paint
these
dazzling
picture
,
they
only
serve
to
push
I
further
away
from
the
material
and
remind
I
that
there
be
no
connection
between
I
and
the
film
.
in
the
end
,
the
movie
's
one
strength
end
up
hurt
it
.
so
here
we
have
two
film
with
pretty
uninteresting
plot
,
and
yet
i
be
able
to
truly
enjoy
one
of
they
.
why
?
with
both
film
,
my
head
care
about
neither
story
,
but
only
''
everyone
say
i
love
you
''
be
able
to
make
my
heart
sing
.
