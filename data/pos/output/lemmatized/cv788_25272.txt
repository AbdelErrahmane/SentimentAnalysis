movie
just
be
not
as
delightfully
funny
as
this
one
be
.
every
line
of
neil

flow
like
comedic
poetry
,
and
all
the
actor
be
just
perfect
in
they

and
who
can
forget
that
catchy
score
by
neal
heftus
?
the
best
thing
about
the
film
-lrb-
and
this
be
a
testament
to
the
quality
of
the
writing
-rrb-
be
that
it
be
a
comedy
with
substance
.
these
two

,
even
while
at

throat
,
genuinely
care
for
one
another
as

when
they
clash
,
it
be
not
cartoonish
hatred
be
display
,
but
genuine
frustration
with
the
fact
that
they
be
such
good

but
just
can
not
manage
to
co-exist
.
movie
nowadays
,
take
grumpy
old
man
for
example
,
just
do
not
have
that
extra
spark
there
.
these
day
it
be
just
animosity
for
the
sake
of
comedy
.
a
television
series

star
jack

tony
randall
-rrb-

which
i
'll
admit
i
have
never
see
a
episode
of
in
its
entirety
,
and
neil
simon
even
script
the
sequel
,
the
odd
couple
ii
,
which
be
release
in
1998
.
neither
of
they
compare
to
this
comic
masterpiece
though
.
it
be
one
of
the
best
comedy
of
all
time
and
easily
earn
its
spot
in
my
top
ten
favorite
film
