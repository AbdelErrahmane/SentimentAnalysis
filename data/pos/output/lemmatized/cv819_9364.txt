one
of
the
biggest
cliche
of
any
serial
killer
film
be
also
one
of
the
most
believable
.
you
know
,
the
one
where
the
detective
look
at
a
wall
of
picture
and
other
police
information
,
and
suddenly
spot
the
clue
which
reveal
who
the
killer
be
.
sure
,
it
be
be
use
over
and
over
,
but
for
some
reason
,
it
be
always
fun
to
watch
.
this
cliche
pretty
much
describe
the
level
kiss
the
girl
work
on
:
overuse
,
but
always
fun
.
one
of
my
personal
rule
about
watch
a
film
be
not
how
original
the
film
be
,
but
how
it
go
around
give
its
story
.
this
rule
apply
highly
to
kiss
the
girl
.
there
be
something
psychologically
stimulate
in
a
well-crafted
serial
killer
movie
,
and
kiss
the
girl
be
certainly
well
make
.
however
,
the
whole
film
scream
of
unoriginality
,
and
so
it
rely
on
the
power
of
its
actor
and
the
technical
detail
to
pull
it
through
.
well
,
not
only
be
the
actor
capable
of
pull
it
through
,
but
they
add
so
much
to
the
film
that
nearly
every
flaw
be
cover
up
.
unfortunately
,
one
of
the
most
revealing
and
rather
insulting
choice
by
the
filmmaker
-lrb-
one
that
seven
,
a
film
a
lot
like
this
one
,
know
not
to
make
-rrb-
be
to
put
the
name
of
the
killer
in
the
opening
credit
.
that
may
give
the
actor
credit
for
the
role
,
but
throughout
the
film
,
hide
in
my
mind
,
i
be
wait
for
he
to
appear
on
screen
,
which
spoil
the
mystery
.
however
,
credit
must
be
give
to
the
director
for
suspend
this
knowledge
through
most
of
the
film
.
plotwise
,
kiss
the
girl
show
almost
no
originality
.
we
be
introduce
to
detective
alex
cross
-lrb-
morgan
freeman
-rrb-
,
a
forensic
psychologist
,
and
immediately
we
be
give
the
cliched
scene
establish
he
as
the
hero
.
he
get
a
call
about
a
woman
who
have
shoot
she
husband
and
be
now
threaten
to
kill
herself
.
obviously
cross
succeed
at
get
the
gun
,
but
this
scene
be
quickly
forget
during
the
next
scene
.
at
he
house
,
cross
be
tell
that
he
neice
,
naomus
-lrb-
gina
ravera
-rrb-
,
have
be
miss
for
four
day
.
this
provide
the
motivation
for
cross
to
find
the
killer
,
but
we
be
never
give
a
chance
to
establish
the
relationship
between
the
two
,
and
as
a
result
,
we
can
not
sympathize
with
detective
cross
.
however
,
what
make
kiss
the
girl
slightly
original
be
the
introduction
of
one
of
the
abductee
...
before
she
be
abducted
.
dr
.
kate
mctiernan
-lrb-
ashley
judd
,
the
actress
of
the
judd
family
-rrb-
be
a
smart
,
athletic
woman
,
and
because
of
these
trait
,
become
a
target
for
casanova
--
what
the
serial
killer
like
to
call
himself
.
because
of
these
character-developing
scene
,
we
care
for
mctiernan
,
make
the
abduction
scene
all
that
more
suspenseful
.
after
be
abducted
,
mctiernan
wake
up
and
find
herself
in
a
cell
somewhere
in
the
wood
.
remember
that
the
killer
give
she
certain
rule
,
she
decide
to
break
one
of
they
by
call
out
.
when
casanova
come
to
punish
she
,
she
break
out
and
escape
by
jump
over
a
waterfall
.
after
she
be
find
,
she
begin
to
help
cross
find
he
neice
.
from
this
moment
on
,
kiss
the
girl
take
on
the
form
of
every
other
serial
killer
film
,
as
the
two
lead
search
for
the
rest
of
the
victim
hold
captive
.
many
people
will
compare
this
film
to
1995
's
seven
,
another
killer
film
star
morgan
freeman
,
but
i
presume
that
the
similarity
be
intentional
.
the
screenplay
,
by
david
klass
,
be
adapt
from
the
novel
write
by
jame
patterson
,
and
yet
i
do
not
quite
see
how
this
story
could
have
work
in
novel
form
.
what
make
kiss
the
girl
so
good
be
the
act
and
the
technical
and
visual
impressiveness
.
the
cinematography
,
by
aaron
schneider
,
be
reminiscient
of
seven
,
and
sometimes
i
feel
that
many
of
the
shot
be
try
too
hard
to
impress
we
.
sometimes
a
simple
shot
be
the
best
one
.
however
,
many
of
the
shot
be
stunning
,
and
unlike
seven
,
most
of
they
take
place
during
the
day
,
in
sunlight
.
the
scene
when
ashley
judd
be
run
through
the
forest
be
extremely
well
do
,
in
more
than
one
way
.
the
camera
work
be
terrific
,
but
the
editing
make
this
scene
work
so
well
.
the
chaotic
and
mtv-type
cut
give
the
audience
a
sense
of
confusion
and
unawareness
,
exactly
what
judd
's
character
be
experience
.
however
,
the
best
aspect
of
kiss
the
girl
be
its
actor
.
morgan
freeman
be
one
of
today
's
most
powerful
and
believable
actor
.
detective
cross
be
a
very
good
character
for
he
,
although
it
be
just
a
similar
one
to
the
character
in
seven
.
because
of
freeman
's
powerful
presence
,
he
carry
half
the
film
by
himself
.
the
other
half
be
carry
by
ashley
judd
,
one
of
today
's
most
promising
dramatic
actress
.
in
fact
,
she
performance
be
better
than
freeman
's
,
if
that
be
even
possible
.
she
character
be
more
original
than
freeman
's
,
and
she
handle
it
wonderfully
.
we
finally
have
a
female
character
in
a
movie
like
this
who
do
more
than
just
scream
.
the
support
cast
be
highly
underdeveloped
,
but
the
cast
member
do
as
much
as
they
can
with
it
.
cary
elwe
portray
a
cop
in
north
carolina
,
and
unfortunately
have
scrap
for
a
character
.
tony
goldwyn
fair
slightly
better
,
but
we
do
not
really
get
to
know
he
character
either
.
gina
ravera
give
a
good
performance
,
but
again
she
be
not
in
many
of
the
scene
.
so
as
a
result
of
all
these
small
support
part
,
the
weight
of
the
film
lie
on
the
two
lead
,
and
they
do
a
phenomenal
job
.
some
of
the
best
acting
of
this
genre
,
and
some
of
the
best
acting
of
the
year
.
two
other
essential
aspect
of
the
film
be
quite
good
.
director
gary
fleder
do
a
good
job
of
control
he
actor
,
but
the
second
half
of
the
film
lose
believability
,
especially
during
the
revelation
of
the
killer
.
he
also
do
not
handle
the
suspenseful
scene
as
a
better
director
would
have
,
lose
a
lot
of
tension
during
many
scene
.
however
,
to
he
credit
,
he
do
manage
a
terrific
first
half
.
part
of
the
blame
fall
on
david
klass
.
i
be
sure
the
book
develop
many
of
the
lesser
character
more
,
but
klass
focus
on
the
two
main
part
.
while
this
may
give
the
two
lead
more
screentime
,
many
of
the
small
character
be
one-dimensional
,
and
the
killer
,
when
reveal
,
be
extremely
implausible
.
thanks
to
the
smart
dialogue
adapt
from
the
novel
,
kiss
the
girl
always
seem
intelligent
.
none
of
the
conversation
be
laughable
,
and
all
move
the
plot
forward
without
seem
force
.
one
of
the
biggest
problem
i
have
with
the
movie
be
the
motive
of
the
killer
.
i
blame
this
mainly
on
the
casting
director
,
because
the
killer
's
motive
be
because
of
rejection
from
woman
-lrb-
or
so
i
assume
from
the
opening
monologue
-rrb-
,
but
the
killer
himself
be
very
attractive
-lrb-
one
of
my
friend
be
a
,
shall
we
say
,
big
admirer
of
the
killer
-rrb-
.
kiss
the
girl
be
rate
r
for
terror
,
violence
,
language
,
and
suggest
sex
.
with
all
the
implausibility
of
this
film
,
and
with
the
mediocre
second
half
,
kiss
the
girl
somehow
manage
to
thoroughly
entertain
.
in
fact
,
i
have
the
urge
to
see
it
again
just
for
the
performance
.
the
cinematography
add
a
lot
of
mood
to
the
already
creepy
tone
,
and
the
script
be
usually
smart
.
this
be
clearly
one
of
those
movie
which
rely
on
the
act
to
pull
it
through
.
morgan
freeman
be
possibly
today
be
most
convincing
actor
,
and
ashley
judd
add
another
notch
on
she
act
belt
.
i
must
also
say
that
i
love
the
end
.
the
showdown
between
good
and
evil
be
quite
tense
,
and
the
resolution
of
the
scene
make
almost
anyone
cheer
.
perhaps
it
may
not
be
possible
,
but
most
of
the
film
be
not
anyway
.
