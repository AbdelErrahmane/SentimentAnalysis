present
itself
as
remarkably
ordinary

it
achieve
the
difficult
task

also
have
its
share
of
fun
humor
,
such
as
when
will
,
in
a

therapy
session
,
pretend
to
be
hypnotize
and
smoothly
parody
the
alien
abduction
scenario
that
have
become
so
well
know
in

and
in
the
one
scene
in

will
blow

off
with
a
hilariously
scathing

use

the

well

add
all
this
to
the
fact
that
''

even
manage
to
pull
off
a
uplifting
happy
end
without

excessively
sentimental

you
might
be
wonder

not
give

four

well
,
for

thing
,
no

how
well
damon

,
who
write
the
screenplay
,
and
director
gus
van

pull
it
off
,
the
story
be
still
rather
contrived
and
not
particularly
original
.
there
be
also
a
few
scene
that
do
feel
a
bit
formulaic
,
include
one
that
be
suppose
to
be
emotional
but
really
just
seem
like
the
obligatory
cry
scene
for
any
movie

session

still
,
''
good
will
hunting
''
take
its
premise
a
lot
farther
than
i
think
it
would
,
and
be
definitely
one
of
the
better
personal
drama
i
have
see
in
the
last
few
year
,
and
as
of
right
now
it
stand
as
one
of
the
top
five
on
my
list
of
'97
film
.
