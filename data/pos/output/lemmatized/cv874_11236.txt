:
what
if
you
wake
up
one
day
,
and
suspect
you
be
not
on
earth
,
and
instead
be
part
of
a
experiment
in
a
giant
space
terrarium
manipulate
by
intergalactic
alien
zookeeper
?
in
dark
city
john
murdoch
-lrb-
rufus
sewell
-rrb-
have
this
problem
.
dark
city
start
out
like
a
1940s
noir
amnesia
detective
mystery
.
poor
john
wake
up
with
amnesia
in
a
hotel
room
with
a
dead
dame
in
one
corner
.
a
mysterious
phone
call
tell
he
to
get
the
heck
out
of
there
,
and
soon
enough
john
be
chase
all
over
town
by
a
murderous
army
of
pale
people
in
black
trench-coat
,
as
well
as
by
the
police
,
and
the
dogged
inspector
bumstead
-lrb-
william
hurt
-rrb-
.
be
john
a
murderer
,
and
what
can
he
miss
memory
tell
he
?
he
search
through
he
own
wallet
for
possible
contact
and
clue
.
but
when
the
clue
do
not
fit
,
it
do
not
just
confuse
he
;
it
cause
john
to
go
so
far
as
to
question
the
whole
nature
of
reality
in
the
dark
city
.
to
john
,
something
be
fishy
,
and
very
unreal
about
this
city
.
how
come
it
be
always
dark
,
and
nobody
seem
to
remember
what
they
do
this
morning
?
and
how
come
nobody
seem
to
remember
how
to
leave
the
city
,
or
how
to
get
to
nearby
shell
beach
?
every
night
,
around
midnight
,
john
notice
that
the
whole
city
enter
a
state
of
suspend
animation
,
and
at
this
time
,
creepy
alien
experimenter
know
as
the
`
stranger
'
come
out
and
do
nasty
thing
like
inject
fake
memory
into
people
's
head
with
big
hypodermic
needle
.
the
stranger
have
the
ability
to
`
tune
,
'
or
warp
reality
use
telepathic
power
.
turn
out
,
the
city
be
not
on
earth
at
all
.
and
the
reason
why
john
do
not
fall
victim
to
the
nightly
suspend
animation
,
be
because
he
be
a
human
mutation
that
possess
the
same
god-like
reality-warping
ability
as
the
stranger
.
even
with
the
help
of
scientist
dr
.
daniel
schreber
,
can
john
take
back
the
dark
city
?
opinion
:
director
alex
proya
-lrb-
he
also
direct
the
crow
-rrb-
mention
this
in
the
dark
city
press
kit
:
in
film
,
science
fiction
be
always
''
use
to
have
big
spaceship
blow
up
city
.
i
think
we
be
a
little
tired
of
that
.
''
accord
to
director
proya
,
probably
the
most
interesting
thing
about
dark
city
be
its
layer
.
it
be
design
so
that
you
can
watch
the
film
over
again
,
and
examine
it
from
the
perspective
of
a
main
character
other
than
murdoch
.
it
be
a
philosophical
piece
.
cinematic
science
fiction
be
basically
a
thinly
disguise
shootout
between
the
good
human
and
the
bad
alien
-lrb-
whether
they
be
klingon
,
giant
bug
,
or
proponent
of
the
dark
side
of
the
force
-rrb-
.
but
science
fiction
in
book
reach
beyond
the
`
shoot-em-up
'
level
and
target
the
big
question
,
question
like
who
be
we
?
what
be
the
human
condition
?
what
be
ethical
?
what
would
a
true
human
be
do
?
far
from
comic
book
style
on
the
order
of
spawn
,
batman
,
or
the
mutant
ninja
turtle
,
dark
city
not
only
feature
the
showdown
between
good
human
and
powerful
alien
,
but
it
also
ask
question
worthy
of
film
such
as
brazil
or
blade
runner
.
dark
city
be
what
philosopher
would
call
a
existentialist
screenplay
.
a
little
more
than
200
year
ago
,
the
world
be
fill
with
unhappy
peasant
-
-
unhappy
because
nearly
every
aspect
of
they
life
be
control
by
totalitarian
,
military
,
conformist
,
medieval
regime
.
the
people
take
refuge
in
religion
,
the
idea
be
that
earthly
life
be
a
time
of
suffering
,
but
after
death
,
heaven
would
be
available
.
meanwhile
,
the
state
use
these
same
idea
to
prop
up
they
regime
;
the
king
be
often
head
of
the
religion
and
therefore
sanction
by
heaven
.
when
science
finally
overturn
religion
,
the
medieval
dictatorship
come
tumble
down
and
be
replace
by
democratic
government
.
but
the
new
fear
be
that
the
power
of
science
and
experimentation
would
be
use
to
create
a
world
order
as
darkly
totalitarian
as
the
old
.
this
be
the
time
period
when
writer
and
philosopher
such
as
freud
,
kant
,
kafka
,
nietzsche
,
and
dostoevsky
ponder
what
society
should
be
,
and
what
place
the
individual
have
in
it
.
the
existentialist
'
in
particular
write
about
the
power
of
the
lone
individual
against
what
may
be
a
hostile
,
indifferent
,
or
alienate
universe
.
in
dark
city
,
when
the
last
die
,
defeat
alien
ask
john
murdoch
why
the
alien
'
scientific
experiment
on
the
human
being
'
brain
fail
,
murdoch
reply
,
point
to
he
head
,
''
because
the
human
condition
be
not
locate
in
here
.
