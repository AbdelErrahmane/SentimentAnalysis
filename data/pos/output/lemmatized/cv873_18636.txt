to

quickly
enamor
of
each
other
,
the
two
embark
upon
a
on-again
,
off-again
love
affair
replete
with
romance
,
humor
,
and
the
occasional
lump
in
the
throat
.
the
film
open
with
a
non-verbal
cue
to
anna
's
stardom
as
the
title
credit
appear
over
a
montage
of
slow
motion
sequence
feature
the
actress
's
appearance
in
film
and
at
premiere
-
come
out
of
limousine
,
walk
the
red
carpet
and
such
.
without
word
,
this
sequence
give
we
a
background
to
she
character
.
follow
,
however
,
be
a
set-up
narration
by
william
indicate
what
he
do
and
where
he
live
.
i
do
not
know
why
the
filmmaker
choose
to
go
with
a
narration
which
tell
we
nothing
we
could
not
have
figure
out
by
watch
the
first
ten
minute
of
film
,
and
which
never
resurface
after
the
movie
's
beginning
,
but
there
it
be
.
if
there
be
ever
a
clear
case
for
''
less
be
more
,
''
this
would
be
it
.
the
film
be
tell
nearly
first
person
from
william
's
point
of
view
,
as
he
be
in
every
scene
.
by
nature
of
this
arrangement
,
we
get
a
very
definite
sense
of
what
he
be
all
about
,
and
he
nice
guy
personality
win
we
over
easily
.
in
fact
,
much
of
notting
hill
's
strength
lie
in
the
great
dialog
write
for
this
character
by
richard
curti
.
a
scene
where
william
be
still
in
shock
over
the
fact
that
he
be
even
talk
to
a
silver
screen
goddess
be
make
golden
by
the
way
bumble
through
he
attempt
to
offer
she
some
honey-soaked
apricot
from
he
refrigerator
.
or
take
a
instance
where
anna
kiss
william
and
ask
he
never
to
tell
anyone
for
fear
of
the
incident
hurt
she
image
.
william
assure
she
he
would
not
say
a
word
,
then
add
,
''
well
,
i
'll
probably
tell
myself
now
and
then
,
but
i
would
never
believe
it
.
''
great
stuff
.
the
downside
to
spend
so
much
time
with
william
be
that
we
do
not
get
to
see
enough
of
anna
to
make
they
relationship
whole
and
plausible
.
we
be
constantly
expose
to
william
's
thought
,
feeling
,
action
and
desire
,
but
do
not
actually
get
the
sense
of
how
much
anna
really
feel
for
he
.
there
be
a
couple
of
instance
where
she
declare
she
obvious
interest
,
but
they
nearly
come
out
of
nowhere
due
to
the
fact
that
we
be
not
sure
what
she
be
be
think
all
the
time
in
between
.
this
,
combine
with
the
sheer
iniquity
of
screen
time
between
the
two
,
make
this
hugh
grant
's
film
hand
down
.
he
get
the
great
scene
-lrb-
look
for
one
in
which
he
have
to
portray
a
interviewer
from
horse
and
hound
magazine
in
order
to
speak
with
anna
-rrb-
,
the
great
line
,
and
give
a
overall
wonderful
performance
.
julium
robert
fan
will
probably
be
disappoint
by
the
actress
's
top
billing
and
subsequent
lack
of
involvement
in
the
film
-lrb-
alum
sandra
bullock
in
a
time
to
kill
-rrb-
along
with
she
detach
performance
which
be
only
worsen
by
she
character
's
unpredictable
behavior
.
anna
do
not
get
a
lot
of
we
compassion
.
this
romantic
comedy
lean
a
little
more
toward
the
comedy
than
the
romance
,
much
of
it
supply
by
grant
himself
,
but
with
considerable
help
from
the
support
cast
.
most
notable
be
rhy
ifan
as
spike
,
william
's
eccentric
roommate
,
who
be
in
the
film
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
make
we
laugh
.
hugh
bonneville
,
emma
chamber
,
jame
dreyfus
,
and
gina
mckee
bring
up
the
guard
as
william
's
friend
and
family
,
particularly
shine
in
a
scene
where
william
bring
anna
to
he
sister
's
birthday
dinner
,
and
we
get
to
see
how
these
common
folk
react
to
the
presence
of
a
movie
star
in
they
midst
.
it
be
a
scene
most
of
we
will
probably
think
would
play
out
in
we
own
living
room
be
we
face
with
a
similar
situation
.
roger
michell
's
use
of
visual
do
not
sweep
we
off
we
foot
,
but
do
give
we
more
than
you
typical
movie
of
this
type
.
for
example
,
there
be
a
couple
of
instance
in
this
film
where
large
amount
of
time
pass
.
whereas
some
film
be
content
to
simply
put
in
a
caption
say
''
eight
month
later
,
''
michell
present
we
with
more
interesting
cue
,
such
as
william
's
walk
though
he
neighborhood
while
the
season
change
around
he
.
another
memorable
shot
occur
in
a
park
where
the
camera
be
lift
from
ground
level
to
a
couple
of
hundred
foot
in
the
air
.
we
be
generally
use
to
scene
where
we
point
of
view
be
lift
from
the
earth
to
treetop
level
or
so
,
but
in
this
case
,
the
camera
just
keep
go
up
and
up
until
we
have
a
bird
's
eye
view
of
the
ground
below
.
music
be
use
rather
glaringly
as
a
enhancement
to
many
of
the
film
's
scene
,
and
some
of
this
might
have
be
better
tone
down
,
but
in
other
area
it
work
to
full
effect
.
it
be
kind
of
a
mixed
bag
,
but
still
fare
better
than
many
of
today
's
lighthearted
movie
which
be
so
influence
by
the
mtv
fare
that
the
film
become
one
long
music
video
.
at
least
this
film
have
some
pretty
good
music
that
for
the
most
part
remain
relevant
and
appropriate
.
not
hill
's
grant
and
robert
will
not
go
down
in
history
as
one
of
the
all-time
greatest
film
pairing
,
but
the
chemistry
be
decent
and
the
comedic
aspect
of
the
movie
more
than
make
up
for
it
.
for
a
couple
of
hour
,
you
should
expect
to
laugh
more
than
cry
,
and
that
be
not
so
bad
,
now
be
it
?
