if
there
be
one
thing
that
bother
I
about
hollywood
film
it
be
they
predictable
ending
.
the
devil
's
advocate
have
the
atypical
hollywood
end
,
when
everything
that
should
happen
do
.
unfortunately
for
the
devil
's
advocate
,
this
end
nearly
collapse
in
on
itself
,
and
ruin
the
entire
film
.
nevertheless
,
the
film
do
provide
two
and
a
half
hour
of
pure
entertainment
-lrb-
note
to
self
:

whomever

for
this
film
-rrb-
.
i
do
not
think
i
be
quite
prepared
for
this

make
it
appear
to
be
some
supernatural
horror
film
about
satan

do
contain
this
element
,
but
what
be
not

more
interesting
one

meanwhile
,

-lrb-
craig
t
.
nelson
-rrb-
who
apparently
murder
three
people
.
he
spend
hour
upon
hour
with
this
case
,
while
forget
he
loving
wife
,
who
may
or
may
not
be
go
insane
.
all
of
this
while
john
milton
may
or
may
not
be
the
devil
himself
.
after
a
while
,
thing
turn
completely
upside-down
,
as
kevin
's
wife
claim
to
have
see
monstrous
image
superimpose
on
she
friend
.
a
fellow
employee
be
murder
in
the
park
,
and
he
mother
-lrb-
judith
ivey
-rrb-
reveal
information
about
kevin
's
real
father
.
be
it
all
just
a
big
nightmare
?
or
be
john
milton
really
satan
,
play
trick
with
kevin
's
life
?
the
devil
's
advocate
play
out
fairly
straight-forward
,
but
for
some
odd
reason
,
the
screenwriter
want
to
surprise
everyone
by
give
we
something
we
do
not
expect
.
be
this
surprise
conclusion
suppose
to
make
we
feel
good
and
go
home
without
feel
depressed
or
disturb
?
if
so
,
the
devil
's
advocate
mess
up
completely
,
and
ironically
,
i
feel
more
depressed
because
of
the
end
as
be
now
,
than
i
would
have
if
it
have
end
ten
minute
early
.
i
go
into
the
devil
's
advocate
expect
a
shocking
horror
film
,
and
that
be
exactly
what
i
get
.
i
be
settle
in
to
be
disturbed
mentally
and
emotionally
,
and
that
be
what
i
get
.
but
what
be
the
most
disturbing
and
horrible
aspect
of
the
movie
be
the
poor
ending
-lrb-
do
i
mention
that
i
do
not
like
the
end
?
-rrb-
.
the
producer
of
this
film
take
you
on
a
thrilling
roller
coaster
ride
and
just
as
it
be
end
,
they
pull
the
rug
out
from
under
you
.
film
like
se7en
and
the
usual
suspect
can
survive
with
this
surprise
end
because
it
be
expect
,
more
or
less
.
we
know
it
be
go
to
end
in
a
unpredictable
way
.
the
devil
's
advocate
,
on
the
other
hand
,
end
unpredictably
,
not
from
we
know
a
lot
,
but
know
nothing
at
all
.
if
that
be
confusing
,
i
recommend
watch
the
film
,
and
then
read
that
again
.
as
for
the
film
overall
,
i
enjoy
the
entire
first
two
hour
,
be
draw
in
by
a
terrific
character
study
and
then
add
the
supernatural
plot
to
increase
the
tension
build
from
the
character
study
.
the
film
run
like
a
well-built
clock
,
slowly
build
until
finally
explode
with
a
highly
charge
climax
-lrb-
and
a
unpredictable
one
at
that
-rrb-
.
and
then
you
settle
in
for
a
nice
resolution
,
which
do
not
occur
.
it
be
at
this
point
that
i
feel
cheat
.
take
we
on
a
terror
ride
of
intrigue
,
we
follow
kevin
lomax
around
,
as
he
be
the
centerpiece
of
the
film
.
everything
occur
from
he
perspective
.
he
be
we
representation
on
screen
-lrb-
sort
of
-rrb-
.
but
we
be
force
to
witness
a
conclusion
which
make
most
of
the
film
seem
like
a
game
.
i
do
not
want
to
spoil
the
end
,
so
all
i
can
say
be
go
see
the
film
and
decide
for
yourself
.
perhaps
the
most
shocking
thing
about
the
devil
's
advocate
be
the
extreme
amount
of
everything
.
it
earn
its
r
rating
for
a
reason
.
there
be
plenty
of
nudity
,
sex
,
violence
,
gore
,
and
then
you
have
gore
,
violence
,
sex
,
and
more
nudity
.
this
film
really
be
not
subtle
about
anything
,
show
we
everything
.
it
actually
surprise
I
that
this
film
do
not
receive
a
nc-17
rating
,
as
it
be
quite
harsh
.
however
,
the
movie
do
have
its
merit
,
and
nudity
and
sex
be
among
those
.
i
do
not
condone
sex
and
nudity
in
film
,
but
if
its
there
,
i
might
as
well
enjoy
it
.
the
biggest
merit
of
this
film
be
also
the
most
interesting
to
watch
.
the
confrontation
between
kevin
lomax
and
john
milton
be
entertaining
,
but
what
stand
out
amidst
this
extreme
hatred
be
the
decline
of
the
wife
,
mary
ann
.
portray
by
the
extremely
effective
charlize
theron
,
mary
ann
's
problem
be
incredibly
intense
,
and
i
find
myself
want
to
witness
she
decline
.
this
may
sound
uncaring
,
but
i
want
to
watch
because
i
feel
sorry
for
she
.
she
be
the
most
interesting
character
on
the
screen
,
who
be
force
into
a
world
where
she
be
not
want
.
something
the
devil
's
advocate
contain
actually
shock
I
for
reason
other
than
extreme
violence
and
nudity
,
especially
for
a
film
of
this
nature
.
the
story
actually
have
something
to
say
about
humanity
.
in
one
of
the
last
scene
,
john
milton
explain
to
kevin
lomax
the
game
god
play
with
he
child
-lrb-
he
be
satan
,
of
course
-rrb-
.
he
comment
that
it
be
human
nature
to
lust
and
loathe
in
vanity
.
then
,
god
set
up
rule
which
contradict
human
nature
.
this
semi-religious
bash
be
more
humorous
than
frightening
.
what
milton
say
be
so
true
about
we
society
that
i
find
myself
laugh
out
loud
,
partially
think
it
be
funny
,
but
patially
realize
it
be
true
.
these
moral
dilemma
be
present
throughout
the
devil
's
advocate
,
give
it
a
add
depth
many
film
skip
over
in
they
writing
-lrb-
but
i
be
sure
they
come
straight
from
the
novel
it
be
base
on
-rrb-
.
when
a
film
have
something
to
say
about
we
society
,
it
deserve
to
be
watch
.
the
cast
of
the
devil
's
advocate
be
one
of
the
highlight
,
as
we
see
memorable
face
,
and
they
put
spin
on
those
memorable
face
we
do
not
expect
.
heather
matarazzo
make
a
brief
appearance
as
the
terrorize
victim
in
the
opening
court
case
,
and
she
do
a
great
job
.
probably
the
big
surprise
of
this
film
be
keanu
reeve
.
he
have
prove
himself
a
uneven
actor
-lrb-
success
such
as
speed
and
bomb
such
as
johnny
mnemonic
-rrb-
,
but
he
top
himself
with
this
performance
.
i
have
never
see
he
more
believable
to
date
.
al
pacino
be
of
course
the
scene
stealer
.
he
devilish
performance
be
equal
to
those
of
jack
nicholson
-lrb-
the
witch
of
eastwick
-rrb-
and
max
von
sydow
-lrb-
needful
thing
-rrb-
.
he
could
have
easily
go
too
far
over
the
top
in
many
scene
,
but
he
remain
completely
believable
-lrb-
if
that
be
the
correct
term
-rrb-
.
jeffrey
jone
-lrb-
mostly
know
as
the
principal
in
ferris
bueller
's
day
off
-rrb-
also
give
a
good
performance
as
eddie
barzoon
.
judith
ivey
manage
a
credible
performance
as
the
mother
who
hold
a
secret
to
kevin
's
past
.
connie
nielson
be
very
effective
in
she
role
,
and
she
also
appear
naked
several
time
.
one
familiar
face
with
a
twist
be
''
coach
''
star
,
craig
t
.
nelson
,
who
give
a
very
good
performance
.
the
devil
's
advocate
be
rate
r
for
sexuality
,
nudity
,
violence
,
language
,
and
some
gore
.
at
144
minute
,
this
film
move
along
fairly
quickly
.
for
the
first
two
hour
,
i
sit
completely
engage
in
the
good
performance
and
strong
character
.
the
technical
quality
be
also
remarkable
,
with
great
special
effect
and
a
good
musical
score
.
director
taylor
hackford
have
manage
to
create
a
very
disturbing
motion
picture
,
only
to
ruin
a
good
chunk
of
tension
with
the
final
fifteen
minute
.
i
guess
my
biggest
problem
with
the
end
be
the
fact
that
i
go
into
the
theater
expect
a
disturbing
film
,
and
hackford
give
I
just
that
for
a
long
time
.
but
just
before
the
end
,
he
get
jitterish
and
rely
on
the
hollywood
safety
net
in
order
to
make
he
film
more
mainstream
.
personally
,
i
would
have
prefer
it
end
fifteen
minute
early
.
