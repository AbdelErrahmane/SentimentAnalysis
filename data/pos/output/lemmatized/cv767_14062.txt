be
jimmy
stewart
the
greatest
actor
of
all-time
?
it
be
quite
possible
.
he
career
span
over
40
year
,
and
he
act
in
more
movie
than
most
actor
ever
could
.
yet
,
when
he
be
talk
about
in
the
media
,
he
be
generally
think
of
as
a
actor
who
play
one
type
of
role
:
the
nice
guy
.
and
that
be
really
a
shame
.
''
the
naked
spur
''
feature
jimmy
stewart
in
a
role
completely
different
than
what
people
would
expect
from
he
.
it
be
a
western
,
which
stewart
specialize
in
around
this
period
,
and
it
cast
he
as
a
desperate
man
out
to
collect
a
bounty
on
a
man
who
use
to
be
he
friend
.
before
he
find
that
man
,
though
,
he
run
into
two
man
who
agree
to
help
he
,
think
he
be
a
sheriff
.
when
the
criminal
be
eventually
catch
,
the
two
man
discover
stewart
's
secret
,
and
decide
they
want
a
piece
of
the
action
too
.
the
rest
of
the
film
be
a
suspenseful
journey
in
which
each
man
suspect
the
other
constantly
.
also
feature
be
the
woman
travel
with
the
criminal
,
well
play
by
janet
leigh
.
we
be
never
too
sure
who
be
side
she
be
really
on
until
the
end
.
leigh
be
a
actress
probably
best
know
for
she
role
as
the
''
shower
lady
''
from
''
psycho
''
,
and
that
be
unfair
.
she
give
a
strong
performance
as
a
woman
who
be
pull
between
these
two
man
.
stewart
give
a
performance
unlike
anything
i
have
ever
see
from
he
.
he
usually
keep
cool
no
matter
what
occur
,
but
here
,
he
get
downright
hysterical
at
time
.
i
think
perhaps
he
take
this
role
to
prove
to
the
public
that
he
be
more
than
just
a
''
nice
guy
''
.
he
performance
border
on
psychotic
at
time
,
but
i
love
watch
every
second
of
it
.
it
be
role
like
this
one
that
make
I
admire
he
as
much
as
i
do
.
he
be
a
actor
unafraid
to
take
chance
,
and
even
ruin
he
public
image
.
