in
these
day
of
overlong
movie
-lrb-
meet
joe
black
,
the
thin
red
line
,
the
mask
of
zorro
-rrb-
it
be
a
shame
that
film
like
wake
ned
devine
can
not
be
longer
than
a
paltry
90
minute
.
this
be
just
a
cute
movie
,
even
through
its
mildly
risque
subject
matter
.
old
friend
jackie
-lrb-
bannen
-rrb-
and
michael
-lrb-
kelley
-rrb-
try
to
find
the
lottery
winner
-lrb-
they
deduce
must
live
in
they
dinky
town
of
about
60
-rrb-
so
that
they
might
kiss
up
to
he
and
share
the
winnings
.
through
process
of
elimination
,
they
find
that
it
must
be
lovable
old
ned
devine
,
who
they
find
sit
in
front
of
he
tv
,
clutch
the
win
lottery
ticket
in
he
cold
dead
hand
.
what
result
be
thuroughly
amusing
,
as
jackie
try
to
convince
he
wife
that
not
claim
it
would
be
wrong
,
and
that
they
could
really
benefit
.
after
all
,
old
ned
will
not
miss
it
.
rather
than
divulge
the
later
twist
and
turn
,
i
'll
stop
here
merely
point
out
that
jackie
and
michael
get
into
all
sort
of
trouble
in
they
little
sleepy
irish
villiage
.
bannen
and
kelly
be
a
perfect
pair
.
one
slightly
stout
,
the
other
as
thin
as
a
rail
.
both
get
on
in
year
,
they
make
such
a
cute
pair
of
old
codger
.
wake
ned
devine
may
even
be
see
as
a
''
full
monty
''
for
the
geriatric
set
,
especially
since
kelly
get
buff-o
for
one
amusing
scene
.
wake
ned
devine
be
by
no
means
perfect
,
but
it
be
so
sincere
and
touch
that
it
look
so
much
better
than
most
film
.
the
performance
by
everyone
in
the
town
be
great
,
particularly
the
two
lead
.
there
be
one
twist
at
the
end
which
i
find
unnecessary
,
but
it
hardly
ruin
the
picture
.
writer\/director
kirk
jone
should
be
hold
up
as
a
example
to
all
those
hollywood
screenwriter
.
script
as
creative
and
endearing
as
this
should
be
the
norm
,
not
the
exception
.
perhaps
it
make
we
appreciate
this
wonderful
film
even
more
.
have
i
hold
off
on
my
year
's
best\/worst
list
for
another
day
,
wake
ned
devine
-lrb-
officially
release
in
late
November
of
98
-rrb-
surely
would
have
grace
the
short
group
of
the
year
's
finest
film
.
it
be
light
,
but
think
provoke
and
sweet
.
i
can
not
think
of
anyone
who
should
not
see
-lrb-
or
would
not
enjoy
-rrb-
this
film
.
