young
recruit
get
pluck
out
of
nowhere
by
the
number
one
gangster
in
london
and
quickly
become
a
staple
by
he
side
.
but
this
new
guy
be
not
like
all
the
other
,
he
be
get
ambition
,
he
be
get
goal
and
he
love
everything
he
see
about
be
the
number
one
gangster
.
violence
,
lot
of
swearing
and
betrayal
ensue
.
critique
:
a
very
good
,
serious-minded
,
unique
british
gangster
flick
which
miss
the
''
great
''
mark
by
way
of
a
annoying
voice-over
pop
up
throughout
the
film
and
a
so-so
ending
.
here
's
yet
another
cool
crime
movie
that
actually
manage
to
bring
something
new
into
the
mix
.
okay
,
so
it
be
not
entirely
new
,
but
it
be
definitely
original
when
all
put
together
as
do
here
.
the
thing
i
like
most
about
this
movie
be
its
authentic
portrayal
of
the
time
period
in
which
it
be
take
place
.
it
be
1968
and
these
dude
be
look
good
!
yes
,
it
be
all
about
the
suit
,
fella
...
the
italian
shoe
,
the
cufflink
,
the
tie
and
the
bird
-lrb-
that
be
lady
,
for
those
uninitiated
-rrb-
hang
around
you
.
here
be
a
bunch
of
horrible
man
,
gangster
if
you
will
,
look
sharp
,
talk
shit
and
bust
head
all
over
the
place
.
but
that
be
not
the
basis
of
this
movie
.
the
basis
of
this
film
come
in
the
relationship
between
the
number
one
gangster
in
the
group
,
the
excellent
david
thewli
,
and
one
of
he
crony
,
paul
bettany
,
also
extremely
good
in
this
film
,
and
how
the
power
,
sex
appeal
and
coolness
of
one
,
affect
the
other
.
you
know
how
there
be
always
these
''
hanger-on
''
gangster
type
who
latch
on
to
the
godfather
,
the
leader
,
the
top
dog
of
every
crime
organization
?
well
,
most
of
the
time
,
these
dude
be
screen
beforehand
and
be
loyal
to
only
one
person
...
that
be
,
they
boss
.
so
all
the
gangster
number
one
need
to
worry
about
be
he
enemy
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
.
but
this
film
bring
the
betrayal
,
the
mess
up
loyalty
,
the
honor
code
among
bad
guy
into
play
within
the
same
group
and
present
it
in
quite
the
stylistic
package
.
of
course
,
director
paul
mcguigan
be
not
try
to
be
guy
ritchie
here
,
and
do
not
over-stylize
he
presentation
,
jazz
it
all
up
with
a
hip
soundtrack
or
add
any
humor
to
the
mix
.
nope
,
he
go
straight
for
the
serious
stuff
and
develop
at
least
two
particular
scene
which
be
still
embed
in
my
mind
as
i
type
this
.
the
first
be
a
confrontation
sequence
between
bettany
and
a
man
from
which
he
be
attempt
to
sway
some
information
and
it
be
downright
nasty
!
-lrb-
''
look
into
my
eye
!
''
-rrb-
in
fact
,
the
last
time
that
i
have
see
a
guy
so
scared
in
a
movie
be
john
turturro
in
that
forest
scene
from
the
coen
brother
'
miller
's
cross
.
scary
shite
.
but
there
be
a
ever
better
scene
than
that
in
this
film
.
this
one
feature
bettany
,
once
again
,
slowly
torture
,
hacking
and
beat
the
living
piss
out
of
a
rival
gangster
-lrb-
from
that
man
's
point-of-view
-rrb-
,
but
not
before
turn
on
a
quaint
little
tune
in
the
background
and
remove
all
of
he
own
expensive
clothes
,
one
by
one
-lrb-
that
be
right
,
he
''
do
''
the
guy
in
he
underwear
-rrb-
.
that
scene
be
also
in
tune
with
some
of
the
obvious
phallic
and
homoerotic
undertone
present
throughout
this
film
,
especially
in
the
relationship
between
bettany
and
he
boss
-lrb-
why
do
he
get
so
upset
when
he
fall
in
love
with
that
woman
?
-rrb-
.
but
the
flick
's
not
perfect
.
in
fact
,
i
do
not
mind
malcolm
mcdowell
's
voice-over
narration
at
first
,
but
as
the
film
grow
into
a
major
flashback
-lrb-
most
of
the
film
be
present
as
such
-rrb-
,
he
come
in
every
now
and
then
,
and
rarely
add
anything
of
interest
to
the
plot
.
all
he
seem
to
do
be
swear
and
call
people
the
c-word
umpteen
time
,
and
even
describe
one
scene
as
it
be
happen
-lrb-
''
...
so
i
open
the
door
,
then
go
up
the
lift
,
etc
...
''
-
it
be
like
,
yeah
,
i
know
that
already
,
i
could
see
it
on
the
screen
!
!
overdo
.
-rrb-
.
i
also
do
not
quite
''
buy
''
the
ending
of
the
movie
,
which
despite
be
original
,
seem
a
little
unbelievable
,
especially
when
you
consider
that
it
be
suppose
to
be
take
place
30
year
later
,
and
folk
still
seem
to
be
hold
grudge
,
still
in
love
,
still
live
in
the
same
apartment
?
?
!
?
i
mean
,
c'mon
...
it
be
30
year
,
man
!
!
i
do
not
know
,
somehow
it
do
not
work
all
that
well
for
I
.
but
one
of
my
favorite
genre
have
always
be
the
crime
movie
,
and
this
one
be
a
decent
addition
to
the
lot
.
forget
the
lame
title
and
malcolm
mcdowell
's
narration
of
the
obvious
plot
point
,
and
concentrate
on
the
film
's
stronger
attribute
such
as
its
style
,
the
exquisite
atmosphere
of
the
time
period
,
its
original
look
at
the
gangster
dynamic
within
the
same
group
,
its
memorable
sequence
and
the
solid
performance
from
its
two
main
lead
,
bettany
and
thewli
.
incidentally
,
unlike
a
few
of
the
gangster
flick
that
i
mention
below
,
this
one
be
in
no
way
a
parody
or
homage
to
this
genre
of
film
...
it
be
the
real
deal
!
note
:
this
film
be
pack
with
strong
accent
all
around
,
which
make
it
hard
to
make
out
some
of
the
word
from
time
to
time
.
it
be
also
quite
violent
and
i
do
not
remember
any
film
that
use
the
c-word
as
much
as
this
one
,
so
leave
the
kid
at
home
for
this
one
