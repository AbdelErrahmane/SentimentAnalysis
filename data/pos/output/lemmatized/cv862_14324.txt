it
be
very
rare
that
any
medium
of
entertainment
can
give
one
a
authentic
,
vivid
sense
of
reality
and
life
.
all
story
be
about
select
moment
of
time
and
place
in
the
character
'
life
,
but
only
the
truly
great
one
be
able
to
define
they
reality
well
enough
so
the
audience
can
experience
it
just
as
the
character
do
.
therefore
,
''
go
with

wind
''
deserve
accolade
for
its
ability
to
tell
the
epic
story
it
do
,
in
such
a
craft
,
intricate
,
and
entertaining
manner
.
it
be
a
crowning
achievement
,
not
only
in
filmmaking
,
but
for
storytelling
itself
.
the
film
take
place
in
georgium
before
,
during
,
and
after
the
civil
war
.
this
play
a
major
factor
in
the
film
's
success
.
to
use
such
a
historic
setting
present
many
possibility
and
problem
since
no
one
be
alive
at
the
time
to
verify
its
accuracy
.
it
might
also
seem
cliche
,
boring
and
other
such
deterent
factor
to
potential
viewer
.
can
a
story
set
so
long
ago
be
relatable
now
?
the
film
confront
all
these
problem
,
paradoxically
,
by
not
cronfront
they
.
it
do
not
simply
plug
in
the
''
right
thing
''
at
the
''
right
time
,
''
it
create
a
entire
reality
where
everything
make
sense
and
say
concern
be
irrelevant
.

about

wherein
everything

and
will

in
the

life
and
those
around
she
.
right
from
the

we
realize
how

the
man

,
a
modest
gentleman
who
do
not
seem
to
have
the
same
passion
for
she
as
she
do
for
he
.
he
be
not
so
arrogant
and
demand
as
scarlett
,
in
fact
,
he
be
engage
to
a
woman
with
a
personality
much
more
like
he
.
she
name
be
melanie
-lrb-
de
havilland
-rrb-
,
and
she
be
one
of
the
sweetest
,
kindest
,
and
most
likable
character
one
will
ever
see
.
she
and
scarlett
become
very
dear
friend
,
but
she
never
suspect
the
jealously
scarlett
have
for
she
,
and
the
love
she
have
for
she
husband
.
she
meekness
be
both
she
strongest
and
weakest
characteristic
-
it
define
who
she
be
,
but
do
not
give
she
much
emotional
self-defense
.
act
a
catalyst
to
the
love
triangle
,
and
to
the
story
as
a
whole
be
the
daper
,
stong-willed
,
cunning
,
cocky
southern
business
and
military
man
captain
rhett
butler
-lrb-
gable
-rrb-
.
he
be
quite
a
character
all
right
-
everyone
listen
to
what
he
have
to
say
even
though
he
be
get
a
bad
reputation
.
butler
make
no
apology
for
he
vast
amount
of
money
nor
he
behavior
.
he
tell
everyone
the
much-needed
truth
in
the
rigid
caste-like
society
where
freewill
do
not
seem
to
exist
,
everything
be
do
out
of
honor
and
tradition
.
for
example
,
in
he
first
appearance
butler
tell
he
fellow
southerner
there
be
no
way
the
south
could
defeat
the
north
if
war
be
to
break
out
.
this
anger
they
,
not
for
he
lack
of
faith
,
but
because
he
have
the
gall
to
say
it
aloud
and
boastfully
at
that
.
''
do
we
have
ammunition
factory
?
do
we
have
food
?
do
we
have
a
navy
?
all
we
have
be
tobacco
.
''
all
true
statement
and
yet
the
south
still
insist
he
be
wrong
.
butler
be
a
shifty
character
to
be
sure
,
but
he
take
such
pride
in
he
arrogance
it
be
appeal
.
scarlett
notice
this
too
when
she
first
see
he
,
and
from
the
look
butler
give
she
,
we
know
he
be
not
go
to
stop
until
he
have
she
.
but
scarlett
can
not
get
past
she
need
for
ashley
,
and
during
a
scene
which
set
the
stage
for
the
grand
story
,
butler
learn
of
this
and
continue
to
throw
it
back
at
scarlett
forever
.
and
so
the
story
go
on
,
with
scarlett
be
throw
obstacle
after
obstacle
in
she
life
.
the
conflict
she
must
overcome
range
from
take
care
of
she
entire
family
to
find
a
proper
husband
,
especially
after
she
be
''
marked
''
for
life
when
she
first
husband
die
.
this
give
the
film
many
opportunity
to
bring
in
more
character
into
the
epic
story
.
some
be
vital
for
only
a
few
scene
,
but
they
true
signifcance
will
endure
throughout
the
film
.
in
most
film
only
a
few
character
exist
for
support
in
background
,
but
this
film
be
more
realistic
and
believable
as
it
incorporate
a
support
cast
the
size
of
a
small
town
and
everyone
have
signficance
.
even
people
in
the
background
seem
more
than
just
extra
wander
the
set
.
the
costuming
design
be
outstanding
so
that
the
film
make
for
a
real
sense
of
time
and
place
.
the
filmmaker
could
have
easily
set
more
scene
indoors
and
narrowly
focus
to
avoid
have
to
show
the
outside
,
real
world
,
but
these
type
of
simple
approach
be
never
take
.
the
first
half
of
the
film
depict
the
traumatic
experience
the
south
face
at
the
last
day
of
the
civil
war
.
fleming
be
able
to
convey
the
horror
of
it
all
by
paint
a
image
of
destruction
and
let
the
viewer
decide
just
how
bad
it
be
.
one
scene
have
scarlett
work
as
a
nurse
at
a
military
hospital
while
we
hear
a
soldier
in
the
background
scream
,
''
no
!
not
my
leg
!
do
not
cut
off
my
leg
!
''
another
scene
show
she
simplying
try
to
cross
a
street
,
but
as
the
camera
pull
back
,
we
see
that
she
path
be
block
by
hundred
of
wounded
soldier
,
but
it
be
they
moan
that
be
more
graphic
than
all
the
bloody
gore
could
ever
be
.
as
the
second
half
begin
,
the
film
concentrate
more
on
scarlett
as
a
completely
independent
woman
who
single-handedly
take
care
of
she
family
and
melanie
just
to
spite
the
tyrany
of
the
north
.
she
manage
to
resurrect
the
family
plantation
,
but
all
the
willpower
she
have
can
not
help
she
when
she
must
pay
exuberhant
tax
set
by
the
north
after
the
south
's
ultimate
defeat
.
this
bring
rhett
butler
back
into
the
picture
and
thus
begin
they
torrid
love
-
hate
relationship
.
most
of
the
second
half
of
the
film
be
somehow
related
to
the
relationship
-lrb-
or
lack
thereof
-rrb-
between
rhett
and
scarlett
.
each
use
the
other
for
personal
gain
,
but
at
the
same
time
they
still
feel
a
intimate
connection
with
each
other
.
scarlett
continue
to
use
she
manipulative
power
over
man
to
get
what
she
want
and
because
rhett
can
not
help
but
want
she
more
every
time
she
try
to
one-up
he
such
as
marry
another
man
and
take
over
he
business
.
they
say
opposite
attract
,
but
the
conflict
between
rhett
and
scarlett
go
way
beyond
oppose
personality
,
it
border
on
magnetic
polarization
.
they
need
each
other
and
know
this
,
yet
they
never
seem
truly
happy
together
.
perhaps
they
mistake
love
for
passion
,
and
the
film
leave
it
up
to
we
to
make
this
call
.
both
have
thing
the
other
want
and
vice
versa
,
but
when
they
compromise
,
be
it
just
to
get
they
own
way
or
because
they
actually
care
for
each
other
.
love
and
the
perception
of
love
be
two
completely
separate
thing
and
throughout
the
final
act
of
the
film
,
we
be
leave
wonder
if
rhett
and
scarlett
ever
truly
love
each
other
and
why
.
gable
and
leigh
do
have
great
chemistry
,
always
leave
the
viewer
wonder
which
emotion
be
authentic
and
which
be
manufacture
.
all
?
none
?
either
way
be
possible
and
it
be
a
mystery
that
can
not
be
solve
even
upon
repeat
viewing
.
it
be
safe
to
say
most
of
we
will
not
live
such
overly
dramatic
life
as
those
in
''
go
with
the
wind
,
''
but
it
be
still
a
masterpiece
for
its
ability
to
give
we
a
sense
that
we
have
just
experience
a
life
's
worth
of
joy
and
pain
.
