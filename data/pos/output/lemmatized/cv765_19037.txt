triumphant
return
.
as
spectacular
as
it
sound
,
the
black
cauldron
really
suffer
a
lot
in
its
past
time
.
before
ron
miller
be
fire
from
he
position
as
chairman
of
walt
disney
production
,
he
have
buy
a
novel
by
lloyd
alexander
call
the
black
cauldron
,
a
sword
and
sorcery
tale
for
the
studio
.
bring
this
book
to
the
screen
be
the
studio
's
fondest
dream
.
miller
,
who
entitle
himself
as
the
executive
producer
,
promise
that
they
would
do
so
after
they
have
prove
themselves
on
other
project
.
when
micheal
eisner
and
he
executive
arrive
at
the
disney
animation
studio
,
the
animator
be
struggle
to
complete
the
black
cauldron
.
by
this
time
,
thing
have
go
really
rocky
for
the
animation
department
.
many
of
the
studio
's
old
man
have
retire
or
die
.
therefore
,
the
animator
suffer
a
hard
time
make
this
film
.
originally
budget
at
$
25
million
,
the
cost
raise
to
$
40
million
because
of
constant
change
on
everything
?
and
when
it
be
finally
release
on
June
24
,
1985
,
the
black
cauldron
be
greet
by
praise
review
from
some
critic
,
but
somehow
the
film
flop
.
the
film
be
rate
pg
and
the
film
,
although
`
disneyfied
'
from
lloyd
alexander
's
chronicle
of
prydain
-lrb-
which
be
what
this
film
be
base
on
-rrb-
,
be
much
more
scarier
and
darker
than
disney
's
other
previous
effort
,
such
as
the
rescuer
and
the
fox
and
the
hound
,
which
be
probably
why
so
many
people
consider
it
too
scary
and
stay
away
from
it
.
in
addition
,
other
critic
reject
it
for
have
`
no
heart
'
and
`
unmemorable
'
,
compare
to
other
disney
animated
feature
.
but
whatever
the
real
reason
,
the
black
cauldron
be
a
financial
disaster
,
gross
only
$
21
million
.
the
failure
of
the
film
ground
the
studio
's
animation
department
,
and
exile
the
animation
team
to
annex
building
in
nearby
glendale
,
and
it
seem
like
animated
feature
would
no
longer
become
a
part
of
the
studio
's
reputation
.
the
next
two
disney
animated
feature
,
the
great
mouse
detective
and
oliver
and
company
,
although
a
little
more
lighthearted
than
the
black
cauldron
,
do
not
do
much
better
-lrb-
although
oliver
and
company
gross
much
more
than
the
black
cauldron
and
the
great
mouse
detective
-rrb-
.
only
with
the
little
mermaid
do
the
studio
regain
its
reputation
for
successful
animated
feature
.
as
for
the
black
cauldron
,
it
be
rerelease
in
some
city
for
a
temporary
time
under
the
title
taran
and
the
magic
cauldron
.
finally
,
the
studio
lock
the
film
in
the
film
vault
and
deny
that
it
ever
even
be
release
.
because
of
all
this
,
you
might
ask
yourself
,
be
the
black
cauldron
really
such
a
bad
movie
?
the
people
who
have
see
the
film
do
not
think
so
.
in
fact
,
many
people
have
call
to
buena
vista
home
video
request
for
the
film
,
but
of
course
,
they
deny
it
.
for
a
while
,
it
seem
like
the
black
cauldron
would
never
be
release
to
video
?
until
September
1997
,
disney
release
the
black
cauldron
to
video
in
the
unite
kingdom
.
few
people
import
the
video
from
england
and
convert
to
ntsc
-lrb-
include
I
-rrb-
and
for
those
who
have
not
see
the
film
yet
-lrb-
i
be
include
here
-rrb-
,
they
get
quite
a
treat
.
but
people
who
have
bootleg
copy
of
the
black
cauldron
notice
that
in
the
scene
where
the
horn
king
raise
he
army
of
deathless
warrior
,
about
12
seconds
of
ghoulish
look
skeleton
be
slightly
trim
so
that
the
film
would
get
a
u
rating
-lrb-
in
the
uk
,
the
u
rating
mean
universal
:
suitable
for
all
age
,
kinda
like
they
own
version
of
g
-rrb-
.
somewhere
online
,
a
team
of
diehard
the
black
cauldron
fan
sign
a
petition
that
say
,
`
bring
back
the
black
cauldron
!
'
,
and
because
of
that
,
disney
finally
decide
to
release
the
video
to
the
united
state
.
before
that
time
,
rumor
online
have
be
make
that
the
video
would
be
trim
,
like
the
uk
video
,
so
that
it
would
get
a
g
rating
,
and
that
they
would
add
in
song
.
those
rumor
be
put
to
rest
when
the
walt
disney
company
announce
that
the
black
cauldron
\*
would
\*
be
release
in
its
pg
rate
version
.
even
still
,
when
it
be
finally
release
to
the
we
,
some
reaction
be
mix
.
some
feel
that
it
be
indeed
cut
,
but
some
feel
that
it
be
not
.
but
these
where
only
minor
criticism
which
seem
laughable
,
since
a
film
that
be
absent
for
thirteen
year
be
finally
available
.
as
for
myself
,
when
i
see
the
movie
for
the
first
time
-lrb-
on
convert
ntsc
video
-rrb-
,
i
do
not
expect
much
at
all
.
in
fact
,
i
have
hear
so
many
mediocre
thing
about
it
,
that
i
do
not
think
the
film
would
ever
be
such
a
good
film
.
much
to
my
surprise
,
when
i
see
the
first
few
minute
of
the
film
,
i
be
ask
myself
,
''
this
be
the
same
film
everyone
saw
?
the
one
that
flop
at
the
box
office
?
the
one
that
critic
and
filmgoer
alike
call
''
a
bad
movie
''
?
this
do
not
seem
like
all
of
the
above
.
instead
,
it
be
a
classic
in
its
own
right
.
the
film
have
a
wonderful
cast
of
character
.
there
be
taran
-lrb-
grant
bardsley
-rrb-
,
a
assistant
pig
keeper
who
would
rather
be
a
warrior
than
a
pig-keeper
,
the
story
's
hero
.
the
critic
have
say
that
taran
be
not
likeable
at
all
,
but
the
opposite
be
true
.
he
be
brave
,
loyal
,
and
eventually
learn
a
lesson
about
friendship
later
on
.
there
be
a
likeable
character
here
!
not
that
he
be
the
only
likeable
character
in
the
film
.
there
be
gurgus
-lrb-
john
biner
-rrb-
,
a
lovable
little
,
uh
,
thing
who
remain
loyal
to
taran
,
even
though
they
do
not
quite
hit
it
off
at
first
.
but
another
likeable
character
be
the
bad
guy
comic
henchman
,
a
dwarf
name
creeper
-lrb-
phil
fondacairo
-rrb-
,
who
be
loyal
to
the
film
's
imaginative
and
sinister
villain
,
the
horn
king
-lrb-
voice
gruesomely
by
john
hurt
-rrb-
,
yet
he
also
fear
he
neck
.
the
other
character
,
include
the
sidekick
,
a
spunky
,
but
sweet
princess
name
eilonwy
and
the
comic
bard
fflewdurr
flamm
,
and
three
comically
wicked
witch
who
hide
a
dark
secret
,
although
pleasant
and
likeable
,
be
not
quite
as
well
round
as
they
should
be
.
the
story
itself
be
a
adventurous
one
,
a
quest
involve
the
mystical
pig
,
hen
wen
,
the
black
cauldron
itself
,
and
a
army
of
deathless
one
with
everything
:
a
hook
opening
to
a
spectacular
finale
.
elmer
bernstein
's
music
also
tell
the
story
perfectly
,
in
a
dark
,
yet
calming
manner
.
the
animation
itself
be
surprisingly
good
consider
that
this
film
be
create
in
the
darkest
time
of
the
studio
.
even
though
there
be
some
occasional
effect
that
be
not
quite
good
,
like
the
ground
opening
when
the
black
cauldron
rise
out
of
the
earth
,
the
animation
overall
be
top
notch
.
overall
?
this
film
be
a
entertaining
endeavor
.
fan
unfamiliar
to
the
lloyd
alexander
chronicle
of
prydain
will
get
a
kick
out
of
this
one
,
except
young
kid
.
there
be
some
extremely
scary
scene
which
be
more
darker
than
disney
's
other
film
-lrb-
although
some
consider
the
stampede
sequence
from
the
lion
king
and
frollo
observe
esmeralda
in
the
fire
of
hell
in
the
hunchback
of
notre
dame
be
just
as
scary
-rrb-
,
which
be
the
main
reason
why
this
film
be
rate
pg
.
fan
familiar
to
the
lloyd
alexander
series
will
recognize
the
difference
between
the
novel
and
the
movie
.
even
though
it
do
not
have
all
of
the
ingredient
of
a
true
disney
film
,
this
film
be
a
classic
in
its
own
right
,
and
deserve
a
far
better
chance
than
what
it
have
be
give
.
that
better
chance
have
finally
come
.
whatever
reason
about
why
the
black
cauldron
be
such
a
big
failure
seem
to
have
disappear
,
and
the
film
have
finally
achieve
its
place
among
disney
's
most
proudest
achievement
.
i
can
not
help
but
think
though
,
whatever
would
have
happen
if
the
black
cauldron
\*
be
\*
a
box
office
success
?
