i
have
see
several
-lrb-
but
not
that
many
-rrb-
woody
allen
movie
.
i
do
not
particulary
like
radio
day
,
the
purple
rose
of
cairo
,
play
it
again
,
sam
.
i
quite
enjoy
manhatten
murder
mystery
and
everything
...
sex
,
and
i
love
might
aphrodite
.
however
i
find
bullet
over
broadway
to
be
a
snooze
bear
.
and
bullet
get
some
very
raving
review
,
but
i
do
not
think
i
would
like
.
but
i
finally
see
it
-lrb-
double
feature
with
ready
to
wear
i
think
-rrb-
and
hate
it
.
since
...
i
love
you
also
seem
to
be
get
rave
review
i
be
not
sure
if
i
would
want
to
see
...
thankfully
i
do
!
people
burst
into
singing
and
dancing
,
something
i
hardly
ever
like
.
but
this
movie
be
so
infectious
.
and
funny
!
and
entertaining
!
-lrb-
and
unlike
evita
,
they
only
sing
when
they
need
to
.
-rrb-
sure
some
of
the
actor
may
not
be
great
singer
,
but
they
seem
to
be
have
a
great
time
,
and
so
do
the
audience
.
that
be
all
i
have
to
say
.
really
,
if
you
think
that
be
go
to
be
a
dull
movie
,
you
be
probably
dead
.
and
dead
people
should
not
be
force
into
movie
theater
.
be
mark
leeper
dead
?
he
say
that
''
this
be
a
almost
ghastly
misfire
''
.
the
movie
be
rate
r
,
for
\*
one
\*
use
of
the
word
motherf
\*
\*
\*
\*
\*
