about

really

the

for

thus
,
the
possible

include

as

up

but
why
?
like
the
first
scream
,
craven
and
screenwriter
kevin
williamson
inaugurate
thing
with
a
bang
.
this
time
,
it
be
a
extended
sequence
that
find
a
african-american
couple
-lrb-
jada
pinkett
and
omar
epp
-rrb-
attend
a
sneak
preview
of
''

,
''
make
sly
reference
about
everything
from
sandra
bullock
to
the
lunchmeat
non-role
of
black
in
slasher
cinema
.
before
tragedy
ensue
at
the
screening
,
the
movie-within-a-movie
setup
allow
for
plenty
of
jokey
moment
,
include
a
scene
from
''
stab
''
which
turn
scream

now-famous
draw
barrymore
prologue
on
its
ear
.

-rrb-
it
be

creepy
stuff
-lrb-
i
do
not

i
'll
ever
feel
safe
in
a

theater
again
-rrb-
that
effectively
foreshadow
the
ratio
of
smart
scare
and
spoofy
laugh
down
the
road
.
another
flawless
example
of
this
be
a
riotous
cell
phone-assault
of
the
killer
on
randy
,
dewey
and
gale
in
broad
daylight
;
it
build
comedically
and
end
with
genuine
terror
because
of
the
emotional
investment
make
on
these
delicious
character
.
there
be
other
superb
set
piece
,
but
explain
they
risk
ruin
they
effect
.
there
be
more
player
this
time
around
as
to
provide
both
a
higher
number
suspect
and
a
staggering
body
count
.
it
be
something
of
a
trade-in
--
the
new
character
be
too
large
in
number
to
be
as
fully-developed
as
the
original
''
scream
''
gang
,
but
this
movie
pack
in
know
performance
-lrb-
especially
by
kennedy
and
cox
-rrb-
and
more
death
for
you
dollar
.
it
can
be
argue
that
,
while
the
original
might
outclass
it
by
a
tad
,
scream
2
be
both
scarier
and
funnier
.
it
certainly
do
not
skimp
with
shock
--
a
major
one
be
the
killing
of
one
cast
member
very
near
and
dear
to
my
heart
-lrb-
i
actually
question
craven
and
williamson
's
judgment
here
,
consider
how
much
this
person
have
add
to
these
film
-rrb-
.
sometimes
you
wish
that
more
could
have
be
do
with
stab
--
the
two
scene
we
be
show
be
dead-on
--
but
for
film
fan
,
there
be
plenty
of
subtle
nod
to
movie
like
''
the
usual
suspect
,
''
''
alien
''
and
''
the
empire
strike
back
.
''
still
,
''

do
so
many
thing
right
,
it
be
petty
to
quibble
.
its
penchant
for
parody
be
irresistible
,
discussion
of
the
merit
of
film
sequel
and
all
.
the
attractive
,
solid
cast
be
a
definite
bonus
.
and
the
denouement
-lrb-
while
not
as
shocking
as
''
scream
''
's
-rrb-
be
priceless
;
the
film
's
final
revelation
incorporate

refer

with
one
