critique
:
i
have
give
this
movie
two
separate
rating
because
i
believe
that
the
enjoyment
of
this
psychedelic
picture
be
highly
correlate
with
the
amount
of
drug
or
alcohol
that
would
be
float
around
in
the
viewer
's
own
mind
,
whilst
inhale
this
cinematic
vision
of
excess
.
if
you
be
prepare
to
get
high
or
intoxicate
before
watch
this
film
,
i
would
say
that
this
be
one
picture
that
you
will
thoroughly
enjoy
on
a
multitude
of
colorful
level
.
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
you
decide
to
stray
from
the
addition
of
nefarious
element
to
you
system
,
i
could
not
imagine
you
truly
appreciate
much
of
this
drug-induced
picture

entire
ride

have
say
that
,
joblo
do
engage
in
a
alcohol-based
consumatory
session
before
-lrb-
and
during
-rrb-
the
viewing
of
this
film
,
so
he
critique
of
the
film
should
be
appreciate
on
that
level
.
this
movie
rely
heavily
on
style
and
peculiar
humor
,
rather
than
substance
or
plot
.
it
move
admirably
from
one
scene
to
the
next
,
without
much
basis
of
they
be
,
while
present
we
with
the
two
day
in
the
life
of
writer
hunter
s
.
thompson
during
which
he
seem
to
consume
more
drug
and
alcohol
than
anyone
could
ever
imagine
.
it
be
1971
,
and
the
time
be
apparently
''
a
'
change
''
in
the
state
.
johnny
depp
chew
into
he
role
like
a
overgrown
child
suck
on
a
chocolate
lollipop
.
during
the
film
,
depp
apparently
become
fast
friend
with
real-life
writer
thompson
,
and
be
know
to
wander
off
the
set
from
time
to
time
,
for
the
sake
of
check
out
the
newest
barmaid
at
the
local
watering
hole
.
i
think
he
do
seem
to
exaggerate
he
walk
a
little
bit
too
much
,
but
then
again
,
this
movie
be
suppose
to
be
a
wild
exaggeration
of
everything
and
anything
,
so
who
be
i
to
talk
.
the
one
thing
that
do
blow
my
mind
be
the
actual
physical
transformation
endure
by
actor
benicio
del
toro
for
he
role
as
dr
.
gonzo
.
i
could
not
believe
that
this
fat
,
samoan
lawyer
,
be
the
same
guy
who
play
the
slick
mumble
criminal
in

usual

word
on
the
street
be
that
gain
over
40
pound
for
this
role
,
and
i
must
say
that
he
look
be
deliciously
reprehensible
.
plenty
of
cameo
also
pepper
this
kaleidoscopic

picture
in
the
form
of
ellen

christina
riccus

tobey
maguire

cameron
diaz
,
along
with
a
bunch
of
other
.
other
than
that
,
the
soundtrack
be
expectedly
eclectic
,
the
style
be
not
as
wild
as
i
think
it
would
be
,
and
the
end
be
certainly
not
much
of
a
barn-burner
,
but
then
again
,
who
really
notice
.
this
movie
be
about
vision
of
bat
float
through
you
head
,
johnny
depp
look
goofy
and
be
bald
,
and
the
cornucopia
of
drug-ravaged
scene
fill
you
own
intoxicated
system
with
idea
of
anarchy
,
rebellion
and
the
lose

dream

and
for
all
those
who
plan
on
see
this
movie
without
the
partnership
of
a
mean
drink

a
mighty
doobie

move
