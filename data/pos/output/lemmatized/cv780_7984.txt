some

portion
of

text
to
be
spoiler

forewarn

the
teaser
trailer
for
my
best
friend
's
wedding
scarsely
give
reason
for
hope
-
it
look
like
the
sort
of
goofy
,
light-hearted
comedy
than
might
put
julium
robert
back
in
the
limelight
,
but
little
more
;
i
would
frankly
rarely
see
a
trailer
place
such
a
emphasis
on
people
fall
over
for
laugh
so
often
.
it
be
then
to
both
my
surprise
and
my
delight
to
find
that
my
best
friend
's
wedding
be
such
a
success
-
a
strong
,
bouyant
romantic-comedy
with
some
decidedly
unconventionally
quirky
comic
aspect
,
feature
a
triumphant
performance
from
m
.
robert
.
the
heroine
of
my
best
friend
's
wedding
be
julianne
potter
-lrb-
julium
robert
-rrb-
,
a
successful
new
york
restaurant
critic
,
and
we
open
the
film
with
a
whimsical
revelation
to
she
editor
george
downe
-lrb-
rupert
everett
-rrb-
that
year
ago
,
she
have
make
a
pact
with
she
dear
best
friend
and
ex-lover
michael
o'neal
-lrb-
dermot
mulroney
-rrb-
,
a
sport
writer
,
that
if
they
both
have
not
marry
by
the
time
they
reach
28
,
they
have
promise
to
marry
each
other
.
both
julianne
and
michael
be
both
single
,
of
course
,
and
when
george
inquire
about
michael
's
age
,
julianne
realize
that
he
be
mere
week
away
from
he
28th
birthday
,
and
be
quite
distressed
when
she
receive
a
phone
call
from
michael
later
that
day
.
however
,
she
find
herself
even
more
distraught
when
michael
's
call
be
in
regard
to
he
impend
marriage
to
heiress
kimmy
wallace
-lrb-
cameron
diaz
-rrb-
,
and
when
he
ask
julianne
to
fly
down
to
chicago
for
the
wedding
,
julianne
suddenly
realize
that
she
love
michael
,
and
resolve
to
break
up
the
wedding
and
steal
the
groom
by
any
means
necessary
.
the
setup
for
my
best
friend
's
wedding
,
then
,
be
a
fairly
conventional
one
,
and
in
many
way
the
film
's
storyline
be
formulaic
-
but
only
to
a
certain
extent
:
the
film
be
direct
by
p
.
j
.
hogan
,
whose
first
feature
,
muriel
's
wedding
,
have
quite
a
offbeat
tone
for
a
traditional
uplifting
ugly-duckling
story
,
and
the
same
hold
true
for
my
best
friend
's
wedding
,
which
confidently
combine
traditional
romantic-comedy
element
with
a
really
eccentric
sense
of
humor
.
the
film
be
innundate
with
sly
mischievousness
which
seem
clearly
the
influence
of
mr
.
hogan
.
for
example
,
there
be
a
heartfelt
,
emotional
exchange
between
julianne
and
michael
late
in
the
film
-
with
a
trio
of
teenager
,
inhale
helium
and
sound
every
bit
like
alvin
and
the
chipmunk
,
harmonize
in
the
background
.
my
best
friend
's
wedding
open
with
a
inspired
open
credit
sequence
which
set
the
tone
for
the
film
,
and
there
be
scene
where
actor
spontaneously
burst
into
song
to
good
comic
effect
-
it
could
almost
be
argue
that
this
film
be
nearly
as
much
of
a
musical
as
woody
allen
's
everyone
say
i
love
you
;
i
would
even
assert
it
be
a
more
successful
one
.
my
best
friend
's
wedding
keep
break
conventionality
with
its
character
as
well
.
in
a
typical
romantic-comedy
,
kimmy
would
be
portray
as
a
snooty
,
connive
ice
queen
,
and
the
audience
would
be
cheer
for
julianne
to
rescue
michael
from
she
grasp
;
this
film
be
smarter
than
that
-
here
,
kimmy
be
sweet
,
sincere
,
and
innocent
;
julianne
even
admit
at
one
point
that
have
she
not
resolve
to
utterly
destroy
kimmy
's
life
,
she
would
actually
like
she
too
.
the
george
character
be
almost
a
staple
of
recent
film
-
the
homosexual
male
friend
of
the
heroine
who
act
as
a
confidant
and
provide
the
guide
voice
of
reason
-
but
in
my
best
friend
's
wedding
,
he
get
to
have
a
playful
,
mischievous
and
charming
personality
.
throughout
the
film
,
the
formulaism
one
often
see
be
romantic-comedy
be
give
little
twist
,
and
the
result
be
a
film
which
be
compelling
all
the
way
to
its
somewhat
unorthodox
conclusion
.
there
be
a
lot
of
smart
writing
in
the
well-paced
screenplay
by
ronald
bass
;
we
be
give
four
interesting
,
vivid
,
and
likeable
character
,
with
some
good
dialogue
and
some
genuinely
charming
and
touching
moment
.
my
best
friend
's
wedding
mark
a
strong
career
rebound
for
julium
robert
,
who
turn
in
a
top-notch
,
confident
and
reassure
performance
as
julianne
.
this
be
not
the
sort
of
role
one
usually
associate
with
m
.
robert
-
the
julianne
character
's
neurotic
,
fumble
characteristic
be
more
in
line
with
a
meg
ryan
role
-
but
m
.
robert
work
wonderfully
in
the
film
and
demonstrate
she
aptitude
at
comedy
here
,
remain
compelling
and
empathetic
to
the
audience
,
if
not
entirely
sympathetic
,
even
when
she
deed
do
to
destroy
the
wedding
plan
of
she
best
friend
be
less
than
honorable
.
even
better
than
m
.
robert
though
be
cameron
diaz
,
who
turn
in
a
shine
performance
in
my
best
friend
's
weddding
.
with
a
smile
which
light
up
the
screen
,
she
effectively
convey
kimmy
's
insecurity
and
utter
sweetness
in
a
endearing
manner
,
and
never
hit
a
false
note
in
the
film
.
she
even
sing
-
i
will
not
soon
forget
she
charming
serenade
of
''
i
just
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
myself
''
.
rupert
everett
be
give
a
very
juicy
role
as
george
,
and
he
make
the
most
of
it
with
a
hilarious
turn
which
make
he
character
perhaps
the
most
vivid
and
most
memorable
in
the
film
.
he
george
be
a
bit
of
a
devilish
rogue
,
entirely
affable
,
and
mr
.
everett
's
performance
be
a
delight
to
watch
;
he
be
clearly
have
fun
,
and
he
joy
be
infectuous
.
dermot
mulroney
be
adequate
in
a
thankless
role
-
unlike
the
other
character
in
the
film
,
he
be
not
give
a
lot
to
do
,
but
there
be
a
genuine
onscreen
chemistry
between
m
.
robert
and
mr
.
mulroney
,
and
consequently
the
longstanding
friendship
between
he
michael
character
and
the
julianne
character
always
seem
completely
authentic
.
when
julium
robert
'
lustre
begin
to
fade
,
and
she
be
usurp
from
she
title
as
''
america
's
sweetheart
''
by
sandra
bullock
,
i
think
it
be
a
canny
career
move
on
she
part
to
take
support
role
in
prestige
project
like
michael
collin
and
everyone
say
i
love
you
to
raise
she
profile
.
while
that
do
not
quite
work
out
,
it
be
near-certain
that
she
successful
return
to
the
genre
which
make
she
a
big
star
back
in
1990
,
the
romantic-comedy
,
will
once
again
raise
she
ante
in
the
hollywood
game
.
my
best
friend
's
wedding
mark
a
return
to
form
for
m
.
robert
,
and
cement
p
.
j
.
hogan
's
reputation
as
a
skilled
director
of
comedy
.
