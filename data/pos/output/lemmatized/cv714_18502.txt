have
be
receive
,
it
seem
almost
impossible
to
avoid
interest
in
see
the

.
the

the
most
anticipated
motion
picture
ever
,
with
a
marketing
campaign
so
strong
it

and

together
.
can
george

succeed
yet
again
with
transport
we
back
a
long
time
ago
,
in
a
galaxy
far
,
far
away
...
?
yes
.
this
star
war
prequel
may
be
the
worst
of
the
bunch
,
with
amateurish
dialogue
and
a
overall
lack
of
humanity
.
but
that
do
not
mean
it
fail
to
comply
on
the
basis
of
solid
entertainment
.
the
phantom
menace
feature
the
most
eye-catching
,
jaw-dropping
visual
look
in
cinematic
history
.
the
tremendous
action
sequence
will
have
you
cling
to
you
arm
rest
,
and
the
special
effect
be
nothing
short
of
the
best
-lrb-
and
most
plentiful
-rrb-
to
ever
be
catch
on
film
.
the
vast
digitized
world
and
sheer
imagination
that
be
apply
to
this
project
be
astounding
.
the
phantom
menace
be
a
delectable
feast
for
the
sens
,
even
if
it
have
some
disappointing
aspect
.
after
we
be
treat
to
the
famous
prologue
in
the
sky
,
with
john
william
'
thundering
score
,
we
meet
qui-gon
jonn
-lrb-
liam
neeson
-rrb-
and
young
obi-wan
kenobus
-lrb-
ewan
mcgregor
-rrb-
,
a
jedus
master
and
he
trainee
`
padawan
'
.
they
be
on
the
ship
accommodate
the
fleet
headquarters
for
the
evil
trade
federation
,
and
have
be
send
to
settle
dispute
regard
the
taxation
of
trade
route
to
the
planet
of
naboo
.
oh
,
but
enough
about
that
.
the
prime
concern
for
this
prequel
be
introduce
young
anakin
skywalker
-lrb-
jake
lloyd
-rrb-
into
the
picture
.
as
you
already
know
,
this
seemingly
charming
lad
be
the
boy
who
will
soon
become
darth
vader
.
a
spectacular
pod
race
come
soon
hereafter
.
this
particular
race
be
the
most
exciting
,
energetic
,
high-octane
action
sequence
that
you
'll
ever
see
.
one
of
the
delight
of
the
series
be
meet
the
newest
set
of
strange
alien
creature
that
luca
have
devise
,
and
the
phantom
menace
be
no
exception
.
i
love
sebulba
,
the
rat-like
scoundrel
whom
anakin
have
to
face
in
the
pod
race
,
and
boss
nass
,
the
leader
of
the
gungan
-lrb-
who
be
a
neighbouring
species
to
naboo
-rrb-
.
one
character
who
have
be
subject
to
criticism
be
jar-jar
bink
,
a
member
of
the
gungan
race
.
jar-jar
speak
like
roger
rabbit
on
a
hallucinogenic
drug
,
and
be
there
for
the
sole
purpose
of
supply
comic
relief
.
yes
,
he
be
initially
annoying
,
but
i
can
admit
to
laugh
over
some
of
he
harmless
,
goofy
antic
.
there
be
some
lack
of
dramatic
pull
in
this
star
war
entry
,
but
the
presentation
almost
make
you
forget
the
plot
and
character
lapse
.
the
final
light-saber
battle
,
between
the
jedus
's
and
the
horrific
-lrb-
and
terminally
underused
-rrb-
villain
darth
maul
,
be
spectacular
to
behold
.
jabba
the
hutt
,
yoda
,
c-3po
and
r2-d2
have
cameo
appearance
.
luca
have
not
forget
how
to
captivate
a
audience
,
even
if
he
latest
show
obvious
sign
of
tiredness
.
one
can
only
wonder
what
the
possible
technology
will
present
for
the
next
two
installment
,
episode
's
i
and
ii
.
when
they
arrive
,
you
'll
know
where
to
find
I
.
