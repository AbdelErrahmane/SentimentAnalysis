this

could
be
the
most
godawful

the
film
,
plus
some
comedy
,

to
keep
the
child

amazingly
detail

the
film
seem
a
little
catch
up
with
it
be
amazing
visual
by
show
a
lot
of
sweeping
visual
and
`
move
'
shot
,
but
they
_
do
_
look
incredible
.
the
final
`
plague
'
where
god
kill
every
first
bear

and
jeff
goldblum
be
great
,
and
steve
martin
and

they
be
well

aswell
.
-rrb-
the
musical

suitably
epic
,
with
some
beautiful
tune
