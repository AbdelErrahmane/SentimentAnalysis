the
latest
epo
from
lar
be
a
blast
,
although
a
rather
moody
one
.
this
lovestory
be
situate
in
a
small
town
in
the
rough
dreary
cliff
in
the
vestern
part
of
scotland
in
the
1970
something
.
the
church
-lrb-
calvinistic
-rrb-
be
so
strict
that
the
church
bell
have
be
remove
from
the
clocktower
,
they
be
consider
be
too
unrestrained
.
in
these
surroundings
we
find
the
to-be-wed
jan
and
bess
,
play
by
stellan
skarsgaard
and
the
remarkable
new
movie
actress
emily
watson
.
jan
be
on
leave
from
the
oilrig
and
bess
.
.
be
just
bess
,
a
bit
naive
and
innocent
-lrb-
in
every
aspect
of
the
word
-rrb-
,
at
first
.
at
the
wedding
party
we
be
tell
a
anecdote
,
illustrate
she
infinite
kindness
,
she
once
lend
a
bike
to
a
stranger
,
she
best
friend
bike
however
.
but
bess
be
suffer
in
this
scary
religious
society
.
we
soon
take
part
in
a
funeral
where
a
man
,
fall
off
the
orthodox
path
,
be
lay
to
rest
while
doom
to
hell
.
woman
be
not
allow
to
attend
funeral
or
speak
up
in
the
church
.
when
the
end
of
the
honeymoon
approach
we
see
bess
idolize
jan
in
such
a
intend
,
almost
manic
,
that
she
friend
try
to
calm
she
down
a
bit
.
the
time
have
come
when
jan
be
to
return
to
the
rig
,
bess
be
fall
into
the
darkness
of
depression
,
she
yell
of
grief
and
sorrow
be
hear
above
the
breaking
of
the
wave
.
she
can
not
stand
the
thought
of
life
without
she
husband
.
we
witness
she
dialogue
with
god
-lrb-
she
speak
both
part
,
paranoia
?
-rrb-
convince
god
to
return
jan
from
the
oilrig
,
and
she
prayer
be
hear
.
a
accident
on
the
rig
bring
he
back
,
paralyse
from
the
neck
and
down
.
now
he
can
not
satisfy
she
need
for
physical
love
,
he
try
to
persuade
she
into
find
a
lover
,
with
the
ulterior
motive
to
make
she
describe
these
affair
to
he
in
every
detail
.
at
first
she
resist
,
but
she
love
for
jan
and
he
assurance
that
this
will
make
he
recover
more
rapidly
make
she
comply
.
imagine
what
this
be
do
to
the
poor
girl
?
the
story
be
cleverly
divide
into
eight
chapter
part
by
beautiful
picture
make
by
danish
artist
per
kirkeby
,
accompany
by
music
from
the
era
;
procol
harum
,
deep
purple
,
t-rex
and
other
.
the
use
of
hand-held
camera
and
lack
of
any
make-up
make
the
character
solid
and
help
to
separate
this
movie
from
other
in
the
sentimental
genre
.
the
incredible
performance
from
the
actor
make
the
movie
brilliant
,
though
a
bit
too
gloomy
for
my
taste
.
i
would
say
that
it
be
in
the
genre
of
betty
blue

katrin
cartlidge
as

must
be
the
reason
for

although
we
have
hope
