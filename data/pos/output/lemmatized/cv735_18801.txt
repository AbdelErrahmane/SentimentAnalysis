-lrb-
verne
troyer
-rrb-
,
a
pint-sized
clone
who
be
the
result
of
a
experiment
go
awry
.
mini-me
be
the
most
perfect
new
character
that
any
fan
could
ask
for
,
and
troyer
do
a
terrific
job
of
mimic
everything
that
he
big

,
pinkie
and
all
.
mindy
sterling

assassin
sidekick

and
here
we
be
treat
to
a
brief
romantic
liaison
between
the
two
in
a
underground
bedroom
chamber
.
this
work
surprisingly
well
.
afterward
,
there
be
even
a
meeting
at
the
coffee
machine
,
where
they
awkwardness
be
express
in
a
scene
you
would
expect
in
any
normal
office
environment
.
oh
,
yes
...
the
plot
.
after
a
short
honeymoon
with
vanessa

-lrb-
elizabeth
hurley
-rrb-
that

disastrously
wrong
,
power
be
back
on
the
case
to
thwart
the
diabolical
plan
of
dr
.
evil
.
in
the
original
,
the
subject
of
the
day
be
cryogenic
freezing
that
enable
the
character
to
hop
between
two
time
period
.
here
,
it
be
time
travel
.
dr
.
evil
have
this
crazy
plan
to
steal
austin
's
mojo
-lrb-
the
source
of
he
sexual
power
-rrb-
,
so
he
jump
through
a
time
portal
back
into
1969
when
power
be
still
be
he
freezing
chamber
.
there
,
he
employ
a
grotesque
600-pound
scottish
assassin
name
fat
bastard
-lrb-
also
myer
-rrb-
to
commandeer
the
mojo
,
so
that
we
future
hero
be
leave
completely
shagless
.
meanwhile
,
austin
be
inform
of
evil
's
wrong-doing
by
basil
exposition
-lrb-
michael
york
-rrb-
,
and
be
supply
with
he
very
own
time-traveling
device
in
the
form
of
a
volkswagen
beetle
.
once
back
in
1969
,
power
meet
a
foxy
cium
operative
name
felicity
shagwell
-lrb-
heather
graham
-rrb-
,
and
learn
of
dr
.
evil
's
plan
to
destroy
washington
dc
with
a
lazer
on
the
moon
.
in
one
of
the
many
uproarious
jab
at
star
war
,
evil
call
the
moon
base
a
`
death
star
'
.
if
there
ever
be
a
movie
that
know
from
the
start
it
be
a
complete
joke
,
it
be
austin
power
:
the
spy
who
shag
I
.
ap2
have
many
hilarious
moment
,
much
more
so
,
than
the
original
austin
power
.
but
what
it
do
not
have
be
the
confident
support
system
that
the
first
boast
,
and
the
joke
be
now
more
scattershot
and
hit-and-miss
.
while
myer
have
a
knack
for
deliver
clever
,
inspired
gag
,
he
sometimes
do
not
know
when
to
call
it
quit
.
the
hilarious
scene
in
the
original
involve
mustafa
-lrb-
will
ferrell
-rrb-
and
he
refusal
to
die
be
play
out
here
in
a
disappointing
and
tired
manner
.
robert
wagner
,
as
dr
.
evil
's
#
2
man
,
have
only
one
scene
early
on
in
the
film
,
where
he
lack
all
the
focus
of
the
character
.
one
nice
surprise
be
rob
lowe
,
as
the
young
#
2
,
who
pattern
wagner
's
voice
and
movement
right
down
to
a
tee
.
there
be
more
recycled
joke
from
the
predecessor
,
include
kristen
johnston
as
ivana
humpalot
-lrb-
a
unfunny
rendition
of
alotta
fagina
-rrb-
.
but
myer
have
clearly
put
so
much
dedication
into
this
project
,
and
many
bit
be
side-splittingly
funny
.
do
not
miss
a
extended
visual
gag
in
a
tent
,
where
the
shadow
leave
much
to
the
imagination
...
of
the
new
character
,
graham
do
not
leave
much
of
a
impression
.
she
performance
be
merely
okay
,
and
she
lack
the
gung-ho
enthusiasm
that
make
elizabeth
hurley
so
enjoyable
before
she
.
and
as
for
fat
bastard
...
well
,
he
provide
one
or
two
hilarious
moment
,
but
all
of
the
obesity
joke
and
bathroom
talk
go
too
far
.
but
my
most
severe
complaint
:
mr
.
bigglesworth
be
only
in
one
scene
!
!
but
,
with
gritted
tooth
,
i
manage
to
get
over
that
.
this
sequel
will
not
leave
fan
disappoint
;
it
be
more
often
than
not
a
laugh
riot
.
and
,
i
look
optimistically
to
the
future
,
where
i
foresee
more
installment
to
the
austin
power
collection
.
if
myer
can
up
the
quota
of
fresh
idea
,
we
should
be
in
store
for
much
more
.
