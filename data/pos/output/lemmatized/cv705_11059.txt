mary
norton
's
child
's
book
series
,
the
borrower
,
have
be
make
into
several
below-average
television
movie
.
so
,
i
be
not
too
enthused
as
i
enter
the
theater
for
the
big-screen
debut
of
the
minute
clan
.
but
i
be
in
for
a
shock
,
the
borrower
be
actually
a
thoroughly
delightful
movie
with
plenty
of
good
laugh
and
even
some
decent
special
effect
.
the
lender
family
be
be
throw
out
of
they
longtime
home
.
they
aunt
,
who
own
the
property
,
never
leave
a
will
.
now
,
a
unscrupulous
lawyer
,
ocious
potter
-lrb-
john
goodman
-rrb-
plan
to
demolish
the
house
and
replace
it
with
a
ultra-modern
housing
development
.
but
the
lender
be
not
alone
in
they
house
.
live
under
the
floorboard
be
a
family
of
borrower
,
4
inch
tall
people
who
make
they
living
as
scavenger
from
the
human
''
bean
''
above
.
the
clock
family
of
borrower
be
as
distressed
as
the
lender
,
especially
once
they
discover
the
evil
potter
actually
have
a
copy
of
the
will
which
leave
the
home
to
the
lender
.
so
it
be
up
to
the
clock
-lrb-
pod
-lrb-
jim
broadbent
-rrb-
and
homily
-lrb-
celium
imrie
-rrb-
,
along
with
they
kid
,
arrietty
-lrb-
flora
newbigin
-rrb-
and
peagreen
-lrb-
tom
felton
-rrb-
-rrb-
to
recover
the
will
and
save
the
household
.
but
when
potter
learn
of
the
tiny
people
,
he
enlist
the
skill
of
exterminator
jeff
-lrb-
mark
william
-rrb-
to
kill
off
the
clan
.
there
be
plenty
of
attention
to
detail
in
the
borrower
,
especially
in
the
furnishings
of
the
clock
family
house
,
make
out
of
lose
board
game
part
and
credit
card
.
the
background
detail
be
nearly
as
rich
as
the
entertaining
story
.
the
various
predicament
of
the
clock
family
be
clever
and
thrilling
.
base
on
a
original
story
,
the
screenwriter
do
a
good
job
at
imagine
all
the
potential
and
unusual
peril
that
could
exist
for
a
4-inch
tall
person
.
as
the
villain
,
john
goodman
's
performance
veer
on
the
edge
of
be
over-the-top
.
but
he
performance
suit
the
role
well
,
and
he
do
very
well
in
the
film
's
many
slapstick
moment
.
with
a
nearly
seamless
mix
of
oversized
set
,
bluescreen
shot
and
cgus
,
the
special
effect
in
the
borrower
be
very
well
do
.
there
be
a
few
time
when
you
can
spot
the
effect
at
work
,
but
none
of
they
be
so
jarring
that
you
lose
the
suspension
of
disbelief
.
hopefully
the
borrower
will
surpass
the
curse
of
be
label
a
children-only
movie
,
for
it
be
surprisingly
entertaining
and
fun
to
watch
.
