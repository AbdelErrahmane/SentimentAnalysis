seven
be
a
powerful
,
fully-realized
film
on
the
level
of
the
silence
of
the
lamb
.
it
be
a
disturbing
film
that
accomplish
its
biggest
of
goal
--
it
occupy
the
viewer
mind
long
after
the
closing
credit
have
roll
.
while
this
film
be
not
for
the
squeamish
,
there
be
no
deny
that
seven
demand
attention
,
for
it
be
a
film
that
transcend
its
genre
in
both
style
and
substance
.
for
starter
,
classify
seven
as
a
''
thriller
''
would
not
be
a
altogether
complete
classification
of
this
film
.
while
i
be
genuinely
thrill
throughout
,
i
would
rather
call
seven
a
''
intense
drama
,
''
because
that
be
what
it
deliver
--
meaningful
scene
with
a
relentlessness
that
do
not
readily
let
up
.
part
of
director
david
fincher
accomplishment
be
in
style
.
he
seem
to
have
a
knack
for
know
exactly
how
the
average
person
fear
something
as
''
simple
''
as
a
corpse
.
and
visually
,
fincher
show
we
the
remains
of
murder
victim
in
all-too-realistic
and
graphic
term
-lrb-
courtesy
of
rob
bottin
's
always-grisly
special
effect
-rrb-
.
throw
in
the
appropriate
but
not-to-be-underestimated
effect
of
lighting
and
a
foreboding
score
and
the
result
be
a
technical
masterpiece
of
the
murder
scene
.
these
scene
alone
be
quite
impressive
;
as
fascinating
as
they
be
harrowing
.
yet
,
seven
be
more
than
just
a
technical
accomplishment
.
in
addition
to
style
,
fincher
supplies
substance
.
seven
have
compelling
character
that
it
want
we
to
know
and
understand
,
and
fincher
tie
they
all
together
in
a
completely
pessimistic
view
of
society
.
detective
william
somerset
-lrb-
morgan
freeman
-rrb-
be
a
man
who
have
nearly
give
up
on
the
world
.
its
easy
to
see
why
.
the
world
do
not
make
sense
.
-lrb-
somerset
drive
this
point
home
with
a
rather
ghastly
story
of
a
robbery
victim
who
be
attack
just
block
from
the
police
precinct
.
after
knock
down
and
rob
of
he
wallet
,
the
attacker
stab
the
helpless
man
in
both
eye
.
-rrb-
why
should
somerset
believe
that
by
follow
this
murder
investigation
and
''
pick
up
the
piece
''
he
will
be
able
to
catch
the
killer
?
somerset
new
partner
,
david
mill
-lrb-
brad
pitt
-rrb-
have
not
give
up
on
the
world
,
perhaps
because
he
be
still
young
-lrb-
and
perhaps
by
have
this
optimism
he
be
naive
in
this
film
portrayal
of
the
world
-rrb-
.
he
completely
disagree
with
somerset
abandonment
of
hope
.
however
,
david
's
wife
-lrb-
gwyneth
paltrow
-rrb-
have
so
much
fear
of
she
urban
surroundings
,
she
be
not
even
sure
if
she
want
to
\*
tell
\*
she
husband
about
she
recent
pregnancy
,
let
alone
carry
it
until
birth
and
attempt
to
raise
it
in
this
environment
.
these
three
character
be
all
perform
with
skill
and
authenticity
that
make
they
feel
like
real
people
and
not
the
typical
hollywood
character
a
lesser
film
might
have
offer
.
and
in
addition
to
make
clear
how
each
of
these
character
see
the
world
,
fincher
give
we
support
for
\*
why
\*
they
feel
the
way
they
do
.
but
if
there
be
one
character
that
underline
the
message
seven
be
try
to
convey
,
it
have
to
be
the
killer
,
john
doe
-lrb-
kevin
spacey
-rrb-
.
seven
's
payoff
lie
in
its
ability
to
allow
we
to
see
how
the
killer
view
the
world
and
what
drive
he
to
do
what
he
do
.
one
important
thing
to
remember
about
doe
be
how
easy
it
be
to
simply
dismiss
he
as
a
''
psycho
,
''
with
no
motive
behind
he
slaying
.
this
be
exactly
the
mistake
mill
make
.
in
the
extremely
intense
and
superbly
perform
closing
scene
,
be
allow
to
see
that
doe
be
,
in
he
mind
,
merely
a
product
of
society
.
he
be
a
killer
who
kill
those
who
be
bring
society
down
.
in
he
mind
he
do
not
kill
''
innocent
''
people
,
and
,
perhaps
,
they
be
not
completely
innocent
-lrb-
but
,
then
again
,
who
be
?
-rrb-
.
he
absolutely
infuriate
that
mill
believe
that
the
murder
victim
be
innocent
.
really
,
seven
do
not
just
comment
on
the
superficial
obviousness
of
how
screwed-up
john
doe
be
.
seven
make
larger
statement
about
how
screwed-up
society
be
,
hint
that
society
's
degradation
be
simply
conducive
of
create
more
john
do
.
besides
the
stylistic
and
larger-issue
argument
for
see
this
film
,
i
recommend
seven
because
it
be
,
after
all
,
also
a
very
slick
and
well-made
thriller
.
it
feature
exciting
plot
development
,
command
performance
,
lot
of
suspense
,
and
a
conclusion
that
be
chill
,
riveting
,
and
quite
unfair
.
but
then
again
,
its
a
cruel
world
.
