not
too
many
people
know
who
jame
whale
be
,
but
it
be
a
safe
bet
that
a
good
chunk
of
they
have
see
he
movie
.
if
we
be
to
believe
the
semus
-
biographical
god
and
monster
,
whale
would
have
want
it
to
be
that
way
.
this
be
a
insightful
,
haunt
exploration
of
the
last
day
of
the
frankenstein
and
bride
of
frankenstein
director
,
and
it
be
notable
for
introduce
one
of
the
first
complicated
gay
character
in
a
hollywood
movie
.
god
and
monster
have
no
interest
in
be
a
biopic
of
whale
's
life
because
it
track
only
the
final
few
day
of
he
life
,
and
it
be
probably
a
better
movie
for
it
.
it
be
focus
be
on
whale
's
-lrb-
ian
mckellen
-rrb-
untraditional
and
deceptive
lust
for
heterosexual
gardener
clayton
boone
-lrb-
brendan
fraser
-rrb-
.
it
begin
with
whale
-lrb-
a
fairly
talented
artist
,
aside
from
be
a
director
-rrb-
ask
boone
to
''
sit
for
he
,
''
-lrb-
pose
for
a
portrait
-rrb-
.
at
first
,
boone
do
not
realize
that
whale
be
gay
and
grow
fascinate
with
the
old
man
.
when
he
do
discover
whale
's
sexual
orientation
from
he
dedicated
and
protective
maid
-lrb-
lynn
redgrave
-rrb-
,
he
be
frightened
,
refuse
to
sit
for
the
guy
.
but
he
come
back
,
only
to
storm
out
again
,
disgusted
with
whale
's
''
locker
room
talk
.
''
boone
return
yet
another
time
,
after
whale
promise
to
tone
down
the
aforementioned
''
locker
room
talk
,
''
and
find
they
platonic
relationship
to
be
strengthen
.
meanwhile
,
jimmy
himself
be
suffer
from
hallucination
and
mental
attack
as
a
result
of
he
stroke
not
long
ago
.
he
ailment
lead
to
desperation
and
depression
,
which
build
to
the
point
where
he
be
force
to
ask
boone
for
a
incredulously
big
favor
.
what
be
perhaps
most
sensational
about
god
and
monster
be
brendan
fraser
's
bravura
performance
;
up
until
see
this
film
i
intensely
dislike
the
young
actor
because
of
he
tendency
to
ruin
the
movie
he
be
in
-lrb-
blast
from
the
past
,
for
example
-rrb-
.
i
be
surprised
how
expressive
a
actor
he
prove
himself
to
be
here
.
this
be
impressive
because
he
character
's
dialogue
be
minimal
,
with
mckellan
do
most
of
the
talking
.
that
require
fraser
to
act
through
body
language
;
a
difficult
skill
to
master
,
but
something
he
prove
capable
of
do
well
.
this
be
not
to
ignore
mckellan
's
oscar
nominate
turn
.
he
earn
that
nomination
with
he
touching
performance
here
-lrb-
although
,
at
the
risk
of
sound
like
a
philistine
,
i
would
have
choose
he
performance
as
the
nazus
in
apt
pupil
for
the
nomination
-rrb-
;
a
understate
,
compelling
gem
.
whale
dread
be
remember
solely
for
he
work
in
the
hollywood
horror
genre
,
and
he
think
hollywood
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
battlefield
.
he
rejoice
in
be
free
from
it
,
only
reluctantly
go
to
reception
with
fellow
movie
people
.
in
the
end
,
perhaps
,
it
be
what
kill
he
:
the
memory
of
hollywood
and
war
blending
together
to
form
a
living
nightmare
.
