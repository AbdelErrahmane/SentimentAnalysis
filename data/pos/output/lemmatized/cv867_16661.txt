wong
kar-weus
's
''
fall
angel
''
be
,
on
a
purely
visceral
level
,
one
of
the
most
exciting
film
i
have
see
in
a
long
while
.
unfortunately
,
wong
seem
more
interested
in
experiment
with
he
camera
than
create
tangible
character
for
the
audience
to
root
for
.
ordinarily
,
that
alone
would
be
enough
to
sink
a
movie
,
but
in
the
case
of
''
fall
angel
''
,
this
be
not
so
.
every
shot
in
this
film
be
exciting
just
to
\*
look
\*
at
.
wong
do
really
interesting
thing
with
the
camera
,
but
he
do
not
allow
the
pyrotechnics
to
completely
take
over
,
as
be
the
case
with
last
year
dismal
''
knock
off
''
-lrb-
which
contain
a
shot
of
a
foot
enter
a
shoe
.
ugh
.
-rrb-
the
movie
follow
three
pair
of
lose
soul
as
they
struggle
to
find
some
meaning
in
they
life
.
i
can
not
say
much
more
than
that
as
i
do
not
really
know
what
be
go
on
most
of
the
time
.
in
fact
,
it
be
not
until
about
halfway
through
the
movie
that
i
be
able
to
distinguish
between
each
character
.
the
constantly
move
camera
do
not
really
allow
for
the
audience
to
associate
with
any
one
character
.
we
be
always
keep
at
a
distance
from
these
people
,
i
suppose
in
order
to
further
add
to
the
feeling
of
alienation
feel
by
the
character
.
''
fall
angel
''
be
a
refreshing
change-of-pace
from
most
hollywood
film
,
which
never
bother
to
try
anything
different
,
at
least
on
a
visual
level
.
in
fact
,
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
''
fall
angel
''
be
more
challenging
visually
than
any
mainstream
hollywood
film
i
have
ever
see
.
sure
,
there
be
director
like
robert
rodriguez
who
enjoy
turn
violence
into
operatic
orgy
of
death
,
but
to
see
a
filmmaker
like
wong
who
actually
assault
the
sens
with
image
be
truly
something
worth
celebrate
.
but
if
wong
wish
to
become
a
legendary
filmmaker
,
he
need
to
work
on
incorporate
a
actual
story
into
those
awesome
image
.
there
be
far
too
many
instance
during
''
fall
angel
''
in
which
i
ask
myself
,
''
now
who
be
these
people
again
?
be
this
that
first
couple
or
the
second
couple
?
''
it
be
impossible
to
keep
track
.
perhaps
he
could
let
the
audience
know
right
away
which
character
be
which
,
by
introduce
they
to
we
with
''
name
card
''
,
as
in
scorsese
's
''
mean
street
''
.
that
be
really
besides
the
point
,
though
.
wong
kar-weus
have
prove
himself
,
through
very
few
film
,
that
be
he
be
a
movie-maker
to
watch
.
let
's
just
hope
that
he
hone
he
storytelling
skill
with
he
next
few
movie
.
