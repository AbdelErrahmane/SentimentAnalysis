critique
:
good
little
flick
that
slow
down
at
certain
point
,
and
run
a
tad
long
,
but
generate
enough
twist
and
turn
to
keep
most
people
interested
throughout
.
mind
you
,
i
could
see
many
people
not
like
it
because
it
take
''
one
too
many
''
twist
and
turn
,
but
hey
,
i
happen
to
like
that
kind
of
thing
.
and
besides
,
the
twist
and
turn
in
this
movie
manage
to
remain
within
the
realm
of
believability
-lrb-
or
scathingly
close
to

,
and
even
''
explain
''
many
of
its
turn
with
a
showcase
of
miss
scene
during
the
credit
crawl
at
the
end
of
the
