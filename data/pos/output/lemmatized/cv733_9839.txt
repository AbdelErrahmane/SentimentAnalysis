i
be
bear
in
1970
,
which
make
I
barely
old
enough
to
remember
bell
button
,
8
track
and
disco
.
however
,
since
i
be
17
year
old
i
have
see
more
than
my
share
of
adult
film
.
i
mention
this
only
because
i
think
its
important
to
state
up
front
that
i
be
not
against
pornogrpahy
.
i
have
see
enough
of
these
film
to
know
the
range
of
content
and
quality
available
.
director
paul
thoma
anderson
's
boogie
night
offer
we
a
view
into
the
world
of
porn
during
the
period
consider
to
be
the
golden
age
of
adult
cinema
,
the
mid
to
late
70
.
this
be
the
period
when
x-rated
movie
be
real
movie
,
shoot
on
film
,
show
in
movie
theater
and
even
review
by
legitimate
critic
.
this
be
a
age
when
porn
director
actually
aspire
to
make
innovative
often
educational
film
,
film
that
attempt
to
tell
a
real
story
.
one
of
the
more
fascinating
aspect
of
this
film
be
how
,
like
in
a
any
other
billion
dollar
industry
,
the
creative
visionary
tend
to
be
ignorant
to
the
trend
that
will
soon
make
they
obsolete
.
in
this
case
,
the
arrival
of
the
now
ubiquitous
videocassette
.
burt
reynold
's
manage
to
resuscitate
he
career
portray
such
a
auteur
,
know
as
jack
horner
.
horner
's
have
a
steady
''
family
''
of
performer
,
some
of
whom
live
in
he
plush
l
.
a
.
home
.
but
in
the
world
of
porn
,
performer
be
a
commodity
-
the
fresher
,
the
better
.
when
horner
scout
a
fresh
face
stud
bus
table
at
he
favorite
discotheque
,
he
decide
to
add
he
to
he
stable
.
it
be
a
pairing
that
lead
to
a
meteoric
rise
and
fall
for
a
young
man
reach
he
prime
and
a
old
man
rapidly
speed
past
he
.
as
direct
by
anderson
,
the
camera
move
through
many
of
the
scene
with
a
eerie
omnipresence
and
a
almost
childlike
curiosity
to
peer
beyond
the
closed
door
.
boogie
night
provide
a
voyeuristic
peep
into
the
underbelly
of
l
.
a
.
's
hardcore
film
scene
.
but
the
peep
show
doesnut
let
we
walk
away
when
the
titillation
end
.
the
downside
of
voyeurism
be
sometimes
we
end
up
see
thing
we
wish
we
hadnut
.
by
the
film
's
final
image
,
what
we
we
once
find
titillating
have
now
become
a
grim
reminder
of
the
vanity
of
fame
and
the
high
price
of
realize
you
dream
.
boogie
night
be
not
about
sex
.
it
do
not
glorify
porn
or
the
lifestyle
of
the
performer
.
in
fact
,
the
film
be
not
really
about
pornography
at
all
.
pornography
be
merely
the
set
to
tell
a
compelling
story
about
a
lose
and
forget
group
of
people
who
form
they
own
sub-culture
to
find
acceptance
of
who
they
be
.
the
film
go
to
brilliant
,
often
hilarious
and
sometimes
harrowing
length
to
show
we
that
the
people
who
choose
to
produce
or
perform
in
these
film
be
generally
not
all
that
bright
and
lack
the
basic
tool
to
function
in
the
mainstream
world
.
yet
,
like
in
the
laud
tarantino
film
,
these
people
still
have
they
own
moral
code
,
they
own
concept
of
integrity
and
they
own
need
to
experess
themselves
creatively
.
the
character
we
meet
be
like
a
road
map
of
dysfuntion
.
first
stop
,
the
den
mother
-lrb-
julianne
moore
-rrb-
in
denial
about
she
addiction
to
cocaine
as
she
try
to
retain
custody
of
she
son
.
second
stop
,
the
cuckold
crewman
-lrb-
william
h
.
macy
-rrb-
who
keep
discover
he
wife
have
sex
with
anyone
and
everyone
-lrb-
the
wife
be
play
in
hilarious
cameo
by
real-life
porn
star
nina
hartley
-rrb-
.
but
the
drive
force
behind
the
plot
be
17
year
old
eddie
adam
.
eddie
be
bless
with
a
natural
endowment
so
famous
that
people
actually
pay
just
to
see
it
.
with
no
real
ambition
of
he
own
,
he
hook
up
with
jack
horner
to
fullfill
he
destiny
of
fame
.
he
alcoholic
mother
,
clearly
dissatisfy
with
she
own
lot
,
abuse
he
verbally
and
drive
he
out
of
the
house
.
horner
introduce
he
to
amber
wave
-lrb-
moore
-rrb-
who
immediately
adopt
he
,
a
nuclear
family
be
bear
.
the
surrogate
relationship
that
develop
between
amber
wave
and
she
''
baby
''
provide
some
of
the
film
most
poignant
scene
.
clearly
,
she
be
not
even
fit
to
manage
she
own
life
,
let
alone
nurture
these
lost
child
.
but
the
need
to
love
and
be
love
be
so
strong
,
they
easily
ignore
the
danger
of
the
less
subtle
addiction
she
introduce
they
to
.
even
the
viewer
be
somehow
lull
into
feeling
like
the
love
she
offer
be
similar
to
be
in
a
real
family
.
then
again
,
perhaps
its
not
so
different
from
real
family
at
all
.
eddie
adam
,
who
later
take
on
the
screen
name
''
dirk
diggler
''
,
be
skillfully
act
by
former
pop-star
,
mark
wahlberg
.
i
say
''
former
''
pop
star
because
with
this
performance
wahlberg
can
officially
quit
he
day
job
.
this
be
bold
and
brave
territory
for
such
a
young
man
.
he
pull
it
off
marvelously
.
wahlberg
be
a
''
big
,
bright
star
''
with
a
big
bright
future
.
boogie
night
play
very
much
in
the
spirit
of
the
people
versus
larry
flynt
,
without
the
first
amendment
preachiness
.
its
intimate
study
of
character
make
it
the
superior
film
.
wahlberg
's
surprising
performance
be
on
par
with
woody
harrelson
's
.
but
in
my
opinion
,
boogie
night
,
be
not
the
best
film
of
the
year
.
i
get
the
feeling
that
itus
2Â 1\/2
hour
run
time
could
have
be
cut
by
15
or
20
minute
without
lose
any
of
its
resonance
.
still
,
if
the
subject
matter
of
this
film
intimidate
you
,
thereus
no
doubt
that
once
you
start
watch
boogie
night
you
may
still
feel
like
its
not
you
thing
,
but
youull
find
yourself
groove
to
it
anyway
...
ya
know
,
kinda
like
disco
.
