let
I
start
off
by
say
that
lead
up
to
the
release
of
the
latest
bond
film
,
i
really
be
not
look
forward
to
it
as
much
as
i
have
with
some
of
the
previous
film
.
i
be
not
sure
if
it
be
the
fairly
lackluster
trailer
or
the
ever-present
dread
that
the
next
film
will
fall
back
into
the
miserable
way
of
the
timothy
dalton
year
.
i
be
happy
to
report
that
any
doubt
be
erase
after
about
the
first
10
minute
of
the
film
.
by
that
point
,
it
be
evident
that
mr
.
bond
be
back
with
a
vengeance
.
all
doubt
would
have
probably
be
erase
sooner
except
for
the
fact
that
the
first
ten
minute
of
the
film
be
not
exactly
a
pleasant
experience
.
it
seem
that
nobody
tell
the
genius
work
at
the
theater
that
the
house
light
be
suppose
to
be
turn
off
when
the
movie
start
.
it
take
a
reminder
from
a
audience
member
to
clue
they
in
.
i
guess
they
can
be
excuse
though
,
take
ticket
and
clean
up
popcorn
between
show
be
extremely
tax
on
the
brain
.
anyway
,
after
somebody
remember
what
the
light
switch
be
for
,
i
settle
in
for
bond
.
i
think
the
most
noticeable
aspect
of
this
,
the
19th
film
in
the
series
,
be
that
it
really
go
back
to
the
almost
tongue
in
cheek
style
of
the
roger
moore
film
.
there
be
probably
more
one-liner
in
this
movie
than
in
the
last
several
combine
.
and
bond
's
last
one-liner
in
the
film
be
about
the
best
of
the
series
.
the
world
be
not
enough
also
contain
perhaps
the
most
action
of
any
movie
of
the
series
.
everything
from
wild
boat
chase
to
the
usual
assortment
of
cool
bond
gadget
trot
out
just
when
there
seem
to
be
no
way
out
for
007
.
for
the
most
part
,
the
action
sequence
work
very
well
.
although
,
there
be
a
couple
of
time
that
i
think
some
thing
be
a
bit
over
the
top
,
even
for
a
bond
film
.
i
think
some
of
the
blame
can
be
lay
at
the
foot
of
director
michael
apt
.
while
he
do
a
good
job
for
the
most
part
,
there
be
point
in
the
movie
,
specifically
during
action
sequence
,
that
he
seem
to
loose
site
of
the
fact
that
he
be
make
essentially
a
action
film
.
most
noticeably
sequence
on
a
snow
cover
mountain
and
one
involve
bond
get
through
a
closing
door
look
like
apted
thought
he
be
film
some
sort
of
high
brow
art
movie
.
he
almost
seem
like
he
do
not
know
what
he
be
do
.
but
they
be
brief
scene
and
really
should
not
take
away
from
the
otherwise
solid
job
that
apt
do
in
direct
.
if
you
have
ever
see
a
bond
film
,
you
will
not
be
shock
to
learn
that
plot
have
never
be
they
strong
suit
.
the
world
be
not
enough
be
no
exception
.
this
time
we
have
yet
another
over
villain
that
bond
have
to
stop
for
the
good
of
the
world
.
007
match
wit
with
the
terrorist
renard
-lrb-
robert
carlyle
-rrb-
,
a
man
who
have
a
bullet
lodge
in
he
brain
that
make
he
impervious
to
pain
.
why
this
point
be
include
be
beyond
I
.
they
take
great
pain
to
explain
he
condition
,
but
it
only
come
up
later
in
the
movie
as
a
scene
that
can
only
be
describe
as
look
like
a
afterthought
.
anyway
,
renard
,
like
the
typical
terrorist
that
he
be
,
be
bent
on
some
harebrained
scheme
involve
a
mid-east
oil
pipeline
.
i
guess
world
domination
just
be
not
as
attractive
to
terrorist
as
a
money
make
venture
anymore
.
bond
be
bring
in
to
protect
the
pipeline
's
owner
,
elektra
king
-lrb-
sophie
marceau
-rrb-
,
who
be
the
daughter
of
one
of
renard
's
recent
victim
.
along
the
way
,
bond
have
to
enlist
the
help
of
a
nuclear
scientist
,
dr
.
christmas
jone
-lrb-
denise
richard
-rrb-
,
and
he
old
rival
valentin
zukovsky
-lrb-
robert
carlyle
-rrb-
.
like
all
bond
film
,
you
basically
just
have
to
suspend
disbelief
over
the
plot
,
since
it
be
ridiculous
beyond
word
.
my
biggest
complaint
would
be
that
it
be
about
the
most
disjointed
of
any
of
the
bond
film
.
there
be
at
least
one
point
that
i
have
to
stop
and
try
to
remember
why
bond
be
where
he
be
and
why
he
be
do
what
he
be
do
.
the
buddy
that
i
see
the
movie
with
be
completely
confuse
over
a
earlier
kidnapping
of
marceau
's
character
.
it
be
allude
to
earlier
in
the
movie
briefly
--
although
not
include
in
the
film
.
later
,
it
become
a
big
part
of
the
story
and
leave
he
with
the
distinct
feeling
that
he
have
miss
something
.
but
because
it
be
a
bond
film
,
the
beautiful
woman
and
nifty
gadget
seem
to
make
you
forget
about
script
problem
quite
quickly
.
after
all
,
it
be
not
shakespeare
.
how
about
the
cast
?
brosnan
seem
to
get
better
with
each
of
he
appearance
as
007
.
i
grow
up
with
the
roger
moore
version
of
bond
,
so
i
really
enjoy
the
lighter
style
that
brosnan
bring
to
the
character
.
judus
dench
,
as
m
,
have
a
bigger
role
in
this
film
than
in
she
two
previous
appearance
in
the
role
.
she
bring
the
talent
with
she
that
one
would
expect
from
a
oscar
winner
.
robbie
coltrane
be
easily
one
of
the
best
part
in
goldeneye
,
so
it
be
nice
to
see
he
russian
mobster
character
revive
in
this
movie
.
coltrane
get
more
screen
time
,
which
simply
lead
to
he
steal
even
more
scene
.
then
there
be
the
bond
girl
.
sophie
marceau
might
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
actress
work
today
.
there
be
just
something
about
she
breathtaking
eye
that
make
she
a
natural
to
play
the
innocent
victim
.
those
that
see
she
in
braveheart
know
she
be
more
than
just
a
pretty
face
.
marceau
may
be
the
most
talented
actress
to
ever
play
a
bond
love
interest
.
then
we
have
denise
richard
.
there
be
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
she
be
cast
exclusively
for
she
look
.
and
after
you
see
the
outfit
she
wear
,
you
will
not
have
any
trouble
guess
what
part
of
she
anatomy
catch
the
producer
's
eye
.
i
be
pleasantly
surprise
to
find
that
she
really
do
a
good
job
play
a
nuclear
scientist
.
admittedly
,
there
be
one
point
that
the
audience
snicker
a
bit
at
one
of
she
technical
line
of
dialogue
,
but
other
than
that
she
stack
up
-lrb-
no
pun
intend
-rrb-
to
she
bond
girl
predecessor
nicely
.
i
must
say
that
the
biggest
disappointment
be
robert
carlyle
's
character
.
while
carlyle
do
a
fine
job
with
the
material
that
he
have
,
he
character
just
never
work
for
I
.
the
producer
try
very
hard
to
add
more
complexity
to
he
character
,
but
it
just
never
quite
get
off
the
ground
.
i
guess
i
be
hope
for
a
bit
more
regard
the
whole
impervious
to
pain
aspect
of
he
character
,
but
the
writer
decide
to
play
up
the
emotional
side
of
he
character
.
this
might
have
work
well
in
another
movie
,
but
i
do
not
go
to
see
bond
movie
for
they
deep
characterization
.
last
,
but
not
least
,
we
have
desmond
llewelyn
as
q
.
this
be
the
17th
appearance
for
llewelyn
as
bond
's
gadget
guy
,
and
he
be
as
good
as
ever
.
although
he
screen
time
have
grow
far
more
limited
in
the
past
few
film
,
he
be
still
a
treat
to
watch
.
rumor
abound
that
this
may
be
he
last
appearance
in
the
role
.
he
say
future
appearance
be
up
to
a
higher
power
.
the
producer
have
introduce
he
protege
and
future
replacement
,
a
bumble
and
somewhat
pompous
character
play
by
comedy
master
john
cleese
.
while
we
do
not
see
much
of
he
in
this
film
,
i
think
it
be
fair
to
say
that
desmond
llewelyn
's
legacy
,
whenever
it
be
pass
on
,
will
be
in
very
capable
hand
.
so
how
do
it
stack
up
?
despite
some
problem
,
the
world
be
not
enough
be
a
very
entertaining
movie
.
and
,
all
thing
consider
,
what
problem
it
do
have
be
small
compare
to
some
that
have
plague
earlier
bond
movie
.
this
be
easily
the
best
of
the
brosnan
film
.
it
may
even
be
the
best
of
the
entire
series
,
certainly
in
the
top
3
.
one
thing
be
for
sure
,
even
after
19
movie
,
there
be
still
plenty
of
life
leave
in
the
jame
bond
series
.
here
's
look
forward
to
bond
number
20
.
