those

that
''
`
grease

be
still
the
word

be
right
on
the
money
.
to
celebrate
its
20th
anniversary
,
this
quintessential
movie
musical
be
get
the
royal
treatment
reserve
for
classic
like
''
star
war
''
--
a
well-deserved
,
red-carpet
rerelease
.
that
be
fantastic
,
especially
when
consider
of
all
the
classic
character
and
scene
the
film
have
serve
up
--
who
can

aspiring

and
these
be
all
probably
consider
minor
moment
...
a
very
skinny
john
travolta
and
a
very
young
olivia
newton-john
have
the
respective
lead
of
danny
zuko
and
sandy
olsson
,
and
they
pairing
still
rank
as
one
of
screendom
's
most
effervescently
charming
.
for
those
eight
of
you
who
be
not
familiar
with
the
story
,
here
be
a
brief
recap
:
greaser
bad
boy
danny
and
aussie
good
girl
sandy
be
reunite
for
they
1959
senior
year
at
rydell
high
after
a
brief
fling
during
the
summer
;
both
think
she
be
go
to
return
to
she
native
continent
before
school
start
,
but
both
be
wrong
.
sandy
try
to
rekindle
they
relationship
,
but
danny
's
too
cool
a
cat
to
fall
for
she
wholesome
appeal
in
front
of
he
t-bird
buddy
-lrb-
include
jeff
conaway
-rrb-
.
so
sandy
hook
up
with
a
gang
herself
--
the
pink
lady
,
head
by
sassy
,
sexy
rizzo
-lrb-
stockard
channing
,
just
superb
as
a
independent
woman
well
ahead
of
she
time
-rrb-
--
and
danny
,
who
still
really
feel
love
for
she
,
attempt
a
compromise
of
ideal
in
order
to
win
she
back
.
the
drag
race
finale
be
yet
something
of
a
drag
,
and
i
never
have
think
much
of
''
grease
lighten
,
''
the
film
's
big
''
guy
''
number
-lrb-
that
choreography
--
ack
!
-rrb-
,
but
''
grease
''
's
flaw
amount
too
few
to
carp
.
the
movie
's
first
showpiece
be
''
summer
night
,
''
where
danny
and
sandy
separately
recount
wildly
different
version
of
they
fun-in-the-sun
romance
.
not
only
be
''
night
''
tremendously
catchy
,
but
it
be
also
a
smart
look
at
how
man
and
woman
see
the
same
event
with
vary
eye
.
there
have
yet
to
be
a
live-action
musical
sequence
that
rival
the
one-two
punch
of
''
you
be
the
one
that
i
want
''
and
''
we
go
together
,
''
''
grease
''
's
euphoric
capper
.
all
this
and
some
of
the
most
please
moment
come
from
the
smaller
,
quieter
moment
;
the
oscar-nominated
''
hopelessly
devote
to
you
''
be
a
lovely
showcase
for
newton-john
,
and
channing
's
lament
ballad
''
there
be
worse
thing
i
could
do
''
be
one
of
''
grease
''
's
most
unjustly
overlook
tune
.
the
soundtrack
be
remaster
-lrb-
though
travolta
still
hit
that
awful
high
note
at
the
end
of
''
night
''
-rrb-
and
the
restore
widescreen
allow
we
to
see
previously
pan-and-scanned-out
choreography
,
but
nothing
else
have
change
--
no
computer-generated
background
,
no
outtake
or
new
musical
number
,
no
jabba
the
hutt
cameo
.
and
it
be
a
testament
to
''
grease
''
's
timeless
success
that
nothing
need
to
be
change
--
it
be
the
same
all-around
blast
it
be
always
be
,
with
a
appealing
cast
in
a
fun
story
tell
with
great
music
.
to
'90s
viewer
,
''
grease
''
will
probably
recall
disco
and
bellbottom
as
much
as
it
make
its
original
audience
nostalgic
for
doo-wop
and
poodle
skirt
.
but
regardless
of
what
decade
it
transport
we
to
,
we
can
all
agree
on
one
thing
--
without
a
doubt
,
''
grease
''
be
still
the
word
.
