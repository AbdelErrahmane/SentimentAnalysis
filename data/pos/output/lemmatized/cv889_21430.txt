since
i
officially
have
not
see
the
original
i
can
not
say
which
be
better
.
i
can
say
however
i
like
this
movie
.
geoffrey
rush
give
a
one
in
a
million
performance
as
the
rich
steven
price
,
and
do
a
great
job
do
a
vincent
price
role
.
famke
jansen
as
he
wife
be
great
and
even
kind
of
eerie
at
time
.
alus
carter
and
taye
digg
sort
of
become
the
main
character
and
alus
carter
who
debut
in
varsity
blues
give
a
fantastic
performance
here
as
do
taye
digg
.
chri
kattan
give
we
great
comic
relief
and
the
movie
contain
a
lot
of
comical
line
.
peter
ghallager
and
brigette
wilson
be
great
as
well
and
give
commanding
performance
as
potential
victim
.
the
plot
be
well
conceive
and
be
very
absorb
.
the
movie
have
atmosphere
the
whole
way
through
that
be
disturbing
and
creepy
,
and
even
sometimes
downright
scary
.
i
find
even
the
opening
credit
to
I
a
little
ominous
.
one
thing
i
know
not
to
expect
be
a
`
haunt
'
type
movie
with
special
effect
galore
.
even
though
it
have
fantastic
gore
and
special
effect
,
the
movie
have
only
a
19
million
dollar
budget
,
which
doesn
's
show
all
the
way
through
but
you
can
tell
.
the
movie
be
write
well
,
and
it
be
only
major
flaw
be
the
under-developed
character
and
plot
hole
that
we
be
leave
with
.
the
end
be
quite
clever
and
some
may
not
even
get
it
.
i
must
say
house
on
haunt
hill
be
a
surprise
.
i
be
expect
another
haunt
with
special
effect
,
no
scare
and
a
dumb
ending
.
instead
i
find
a
good
halloween
movie
with
gore
,
scare
and
great
acting
.
house
on
haunt
hill
be
one
of
those
movie
you
really
can
not
take
seriously
.
though
it
be
a
well-made
movie
with
a
good
storyline
it
still
have
some
flaw
.
but
besides
that
the
movie
be
fun
,
smart
and
scary
and
make
we
wonder
why
remake
like
this
can
not
be
make
all
the
time
!
