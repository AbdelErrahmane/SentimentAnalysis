over

he

the
horse
whisperer
be
delicately
make
.
i
dare
say
lyrical
,
since
to
many
people
's
ear
,
that
word
be
synonymous
with
boring
.
hardly
.
the
horse
whisperer
have
little
to
offer
in
the
way
of
surprise
,
but
it
do
have
a
honesty
that
be
refreshing
and
consistently
enjoyable
to
watch
,
especially
in
the
final
third
of
the
story
.
scott-thoma
and
johanssen
seem
like
mother
and
daughter
,
and
you
have
no
doubt
believe
that
the
mountain
vista
would
put
these
new
yorker
under
a
spell
,

since

robert

cast

as

-lrb-
a
gimmicky
but
effective
technique
the
filmmaker
employ
be
a
switch
in
aspect
ratio
from
squarish
to
widescreen
when
the
central
location
shift
from
new
york
to
montana
.
-rrb-
the
underrated
sam
neill
turn
in
perhaps
he
most
heartfelt
,
emotive
performance
as
the
nice-guy
husband
,
who
be
as
authoritive
and
likeable
as
tom
.
he
be
indeed
a
refreshing
change
from
the
sexist
,
lout
of
a
husband
so
many
writer
resort
to
as
a
short-cut
for
explain
away
the
cheating
spouse
's
motivation
.
unfortunately
,
one
of
the
horse
whisperer
's
only
flaw
be
the
chemistry
between
would-be
lover
scott-thoma
and
redford
.
i
like
both
of
they
,
but
i
do
not
necessarily
believe
that
redford
would
fall
for
such
a
cold
fish
,
even
if
the
countryside
air
thaw
she
slightly
.
luckily
-lrb-
and
curiously
-rrb-
,
this
be
such
a
rich
and
textured
movie
that
it
do
not
quite
matter-their
adultery
seem
like
a
afterthought
,
the
obligatory
sub-plot
that
tie
many
of
the
character
'
complex
relationship
together
.
