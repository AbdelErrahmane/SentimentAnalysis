with
a
chain
gang
of
prison
inmate
break

along
the
road
in
unison
to
a
work
song
.
the
camera
flow
around
the
hard
toiling

,
give
a
visually
exciting
symmetry
to
the
scene
that
end
with
we
three

tim
blake
nelson
-rrb-
and
pete
-lrb-
john

-rrb-
-
escape
across
a
cotton
field
.
it
be
the
beginning
of
a
journey
that
take
on
different
meaning
and
urgency
to
each
member
of
the
trio
.
a
strong
suite
,
as
always
with
the
coen
brother
,
be
the
depth
of
character
of
the
folk
they
create
in
they
film
.
they
character
be
goofy
and
comical
,
like
nicola
cage
in
''
raise
arizona
''
;
or
,
dramatic
,
as
albert
finney
and
john
turturro
in
''
miller
's
cross
''
;
and
,
even
a
mix
of
the
two
with
france
mcdormand
in
''
fargo
.
''
in
all
case
,
and
in
''
o
brother
,
''
too
,
the
character
populate
they
film
be
three-dimensional
people
.
ulyss
everett
be
a
handsome
,
hair-obsessed
petty
criminal
with
a
silver
tongue
and
not
a
lot
in
the
brain
department
.
but
,
he
seem
like
a
genius
when
compare
to
the
simple
,
sweet
delmar
and
the
maladjusted
pete
,
who
follow
they
self
appoint
leader
to
a
promise
treasure
of
$
1
.
2
million
.
they
odyssey
take
on
the
mystical
proportion
of
homer
's
original
material
as
they
meet
all
manner
of
people
along
the
way
,
include
those
dangerous
siren
who
beckon
they
onto
symbolically
rocky
shoal
and
a
cyclops
who
beat
they
and
take
all
they
money
.
there
be
magic
,
too
,
when
delmar
believe
that
pete
be
turn
into
a
horny
toad
by
the
siren
.
the
story
meander
through
the
different
vignette
of
the
boy
'
adventure
,
give
the
flick
a
choppy
,
episodic
feel
that
disrupt
the
overall
flow
.
some
of
the
interlude
be
a
epiphany
,
though
.
the
trio
become
a
quartet
when
they
pick
up
guitar-playing
tommy
johnson
-lrb-
chri
thoma
king

visit
a
radio
station
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
,
run
by
its
blind
owner
-lrb-
stephen
root
-rrb-
.
they
become
the
soggy
bottom
boy
for
the
sightless
radio
station
man
and
,
without
they
knowledge
,
be
record
as
they
sing
the
traditional
tune
,
''
i
be
a
man
of
constant
sorrow
.
''
it
be
a
wonderful
moment
of
moviemaking
and
give
we
,
in
my
mind
,
the
best

song
of
the
year
.

this
and
other
wonderful
moment

the
sexy
seduction
by
the
siren
come
to
mind
