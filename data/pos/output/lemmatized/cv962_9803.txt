something
that
have
be
lack
from
all
of
the
recent
disney
release
...
-lrb-
especially
hercule
-rrb-
...
emotion
.
all
the
wacky
character
voice
by
celebrity
and
fantastically
animated
adventure
sequence
be
not
go
to
hold
anyone
's
interest
unless
there
be
a
emotional
core
to
hold
it
all
together
.
not
since
disney
's
beauty
&
the
beast
have
there
be
such
a
compelling
animated
film
with
interesting
character
and
drama
that
work
.
the
story
of
the
romanov
family
,
the
ruler
of
russium
,
and
they
downfall
begin
the
film
.
anastasium
,
one
of
the
daughter
,
narrowly
escape
the
mad
monk
rasputin
-lrb-
voice
by
christopher
lloyd
-rrb-
with
she
grandmother
-lrb-
voice

angelum
landsbury
-rrb-
.
but
anastasium
get
lose
,
and
grow
up
with
no
memory
of
she
royal
origin
.
the
grandmother
live
in
paris
,
hope
to
someday
find
she
beloved
anastasium
,
the
only
member
of
the
family
to
survive
the
russian
revolution
.
a
young
woman
name
anya
-lrb-
voice
by
meg
ryan
-rrb-
run
across
dimitrus
-lrb-
john
cusack
-rrb-
and
vlad
-lrb-
kelsey
grammar
-rrb-
,
who
be
try
to
put
together
a
scheme
to
create
a
anastasium
to
fool
the
grandmother
and
get
the
reward
money
.
they
pick
anya
to
pose
as
they
prince
,
and
of
course
,
it
be
soon
reveal
that
anya
be
in
fact
the
lose
anastasium
.
dimitrus
realize
that
he
can
never
win
she
love
as
he
be
a
commoner
,
and
meanwhile
,
rasputin
be
not
dead
,
and
plot
he
revenge
against
the
last
romanov
.
the
plot
be
actually
quite
well
structure
.
there
be
a
lot
of
complexity
that
may
have
to
be
explain
to
the
kid
later
,
but
it
move
along
fast
enough
that
they
'll
never
have
time
to
be
bore
.
what
this
really
mean
be
that
the
adult
will
not
be
bore
by
it
either
.
there
be
a
great
deal
of
banter
between
anya
and
dimitrus
that
be
very
funny
,
and
they
relationship
develop
quite
naturally
as
the
film
progress
.
there
be
,
of
course
,
lot
of
comedy
for
the
kid
,
include
rasputin
's
pet
bat
,
bartok
-lrb-
hank
azarium
-rrb-
,
who
be
easily
the
funniest
thing
in
the
film
.
however
,
the
comical
scene
never
distract
from
the
drama
,
but
be
work
into
the
plot
almost
seamlessly
.
the
animation
be
gorgeous
-
the
character
seem
to
come
to
life
through
the
talented
animator
.
not
since
beauty
&
the
beast
have
animated
character
have
so
much
life
to
they
.
even
without
the
voice
,
they
act
.
the
musical
number
in
paris
be
a
show-stopper
,
with
some
of
the
background
render
in
a
impressionist
painting
style
.
as
with
all
recent
animated
feature
,
there
be
song
,
however
,
these
song
do
more
than
just
provide
fodder
for
top-40
singer
to
get
on
the
radio
-lrb-
although
there
be
three
of
they
during
the
end
credit
-rrb-
.
the
song
be
all
very
catchy
,
and
advance
the
plot
,
instead
of
just
be
showpiece
-lrb-
except
for
the
pari
number
,
but
that
be
so
much
fun
,
it
be
okay
...
-rrb-
.
i
can
not
reccomend
anastasium
highly
enough
.
it
be
a
wonderful
film
that
rank
right
up
there
with
other
animated
classic
.
kid
and
adult
alike
will
enjoy
it
,
and
it
be
also
nice
to
have
a
quality
animated
feature
film
from
another
studio
besides
disney
.
