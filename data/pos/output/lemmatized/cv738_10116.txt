as
the

''
so
the
pro-slavery
force
of

use
a
similar
defense
.
the
abolitionist
regard
the
african
as
man
,
but
the

see
they
as

in

sense
,
the

with

specter
of

,
which
would

amistad
's
presentation
of
the
legal
and
political
intricacy
surround
the
trial
be
fascinating
,
make
this
movie
one
of
the
most
engrossing
courtroom
drama
in
recent
history
.
four
claimant
come
forward
against
the
african
:
the
state
,
which
want
they
try
for
murder
;
the
queen
of
spain
,
who
want
they
hand
over
to
she
under
the
provision
of
a
american\/spanish
treaty
;
two
american

officer
,
who
claim
the
right
of

;
and
the
two
survive
spaniard
from
la

,
who
demand
that
they
property
be

.
baldwin
must
counter
all
of
these
claim
,
while
face
a
challenge
to
he
own
preconceived
notion
as
the
result
of
a
relationship
he
develop
with
cinque
.
even
though

and
client
be
divide
by
a
language
barrier
,
they
gradually
learn
to
communicate
.
aside
from
cinque
,
who
be
a
fully-realized
individual
,
characterization
be
spotty
,
but
the
acting
be
top-notch

to
become

,
but
the
lawyer
be
never
particularly
well-defined
outside
of
he
role
in
the
la

case
.
likewise
,
while
morgan
freeman
and
stellan
skarsgard
be
effective
as
joadson
and
tappan
,
they
be
never
anything
more
than
''
abolitionist

''
nigel
hawthorne
,
who
play
the
title
character
in
the
madness
of
king
george
,
present
martin
van
buren
as
a
spineless
sycophant
to
whom
justice
mean
far
less
than
win
a
election
.
finally
,
there
be
anthony
hopkin
,
whose
towering
portrayal
of
john
quincy
adam
be
as
compelling
as
anything
the
great
actor
have
recently
do
.
hopkin
,
who
can
convincingly
play
such
diverse
figure
as
a
serial
killer
,
a
emotionally-crippled
english
butler
,
and
richard
nixon
,
make
we
believe
that
he
be
adam
.
he
ten-minute
speech
about
freedom
and
human
value
be
unforgettable
.
one
point
of
difference
worth
note
between
amistad
and
schindler
's
list
be
this
film
's
lack
of
a
well-defined

villain

that

nazi
stand
for
.
there
be
no
such
figure
in
amistad
.
the
villain
be
slavery
,
but
a
ideology
,
no
matter
how
evil
,
be
rarely
the
best
adversary
.
it
be
to
spielberg

credit
that
he
have
fashion
such
a
compelling
motion
picture
without
a
prominent
antagonist
