this

the

only

taymor
do
not

trick

for
the

would
have
resonate
just
as

she
be

also
have

hopkin
'
titus
be
at

tragic

horrifying
,
and
lange
be
sultry

viperous
tamora

the
clear
standout

,
however
,
be
harry

a
moor
who
be
tamora
's
secret
lover

a
schemer
in

own
right
.
lennix
bring
great
depth
to
a
role
that
could
have
easily
be
play
as
a
stock
villain
.
a
great
villain
he
indeed
be
,
but
to
leave
it
at
that
be
not
give
full
justice
to

powerful
and
multi-dimensional
work

_

be
not

success

it
be
never

than
fascinating
,

it
announce
