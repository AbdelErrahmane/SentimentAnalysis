be
it
just
I
,
or
have
disney
film
gradually
lose
they
appeal
?
i
be
almost
stun
by
the
quality
of
''
who
frame
roger
rabbit
?
''
,
a
fun
,
unique
look
at
a
world
where
cartoon
and
people
live
together
.
''
the
little
mermaid
''
harken
back
to
,
and
perhaps
surpass
,
the
classic
disney
animation
from
the
first
half
of
the
century
.
however
,
the
endless
stream
of
''
the
little
mermaid
''
wanna-be
's
be
get
to
I
.
you
know
the
spiel
:
a
lame
plot
recycle
from
some
well-known
story
,
colorful
,
almost
psychedelic
animation
,
the
lead
character
who
learn
a
valuable
moral
lesson
,
the
comedic
sidekick\/sidekicks
,
the
seemingly
unattainable
love
interest
,
a
few
catchy
song
,
a
few
in-joke
for
adult
,
and
the
occasional
out
of
place
warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff
type
joke
.
it
be
a
formulum
,
and
like
any
formulum
,
it
get
tiresome
.
that
be
why
i
be
delighted
to
hear
that
disney
recently
pick
up
the
international
distribution
rights
to
the
work
of
ghiblus
,
a
japanese
cartoon
studio
.
from
what
i
have
see
of
they
movie
-lrb-
''
kikus
's
delivery
service
''
and
the
already
english-dubbed
and
american
-
distribute
''
my
neighbor
totoro
''
-rrb-
,
foreign
audience
be
in
for
a
treat
.
these
movie
,
particularly
''
kikus
's
delivery
service
,
''
be
wonderfully
original
and
entertaining
.
''
kikus
's
delivery
service
''
start
with
a
unusual
premise
:
kikus
,
upon
hear
forecast
of
clear
sky
,
decide
it
be
time
for
she
to
leave
home
.
this
be
unusual
because
kikus
be
not
a
college
student
or
a
young
adult
make
she
start
on
the
world
,
but
a
thirteen
year
old
girl
eager
to
begin
she
training
as
a
witch
.
she
mother
be
also
a
witch
,
and
as
thirteen
be
the
obligatory
age
for
such
training
,
she
parent
treat
she
leave
understandingly
and
put
up
only
token
resistance
.
just
the
idea
of
a
witch
heroine
may
scare
away
some
audience
,
but
no
mention
be
make
of
the
occult
,
and
the
subject
be
deal
with
harmlessly
throughout
the
movie
:
kikus
's
mother
act
as
a
village
doctor
,
and
kikus
be
able
to
do
no
more
than
fly
on
a
broom
.
kikus
must
choose
a
city
to
move
to
,
and
what
she
choose
be
the
co-star
of
the
movie
:
a
german
seaport
town
,
far
remove
from
the
country
life
she
have
be
use
to
.
initially
lose
in
the
impersonal
hugeness
of
she
surrounding
,
she
be
discourage
,
and
unable
to
support
herself
though
she
rudimentary
skill
as
a
witch
.
on
the
verge
of
leave
for
a
new
town
,
she
use
she
power
of
flight
to
deliver
a
pacifier
to
a
baby
who
drop
it
.
the
favor
eventually
blossom
into
she
working
as
a
courier
,
a
one-persons
delivery
service
.
this
be
where
the
movie
become
shockingly
good
.
kikus
's
job
be
a
catalyst
for
she
realize
the
beauty
of
the
city
and
the
world
around
she
.
the
townspeople
she
be
put
in
contact
possess
a
inner
worth
that
do
not
seem
forced
or
artificial
,
but
merely
derive
from
look
at
ordinary
people
in
a
different
light
.
they
be
three
-
dimensional
,
impossible
to
quickly
evaluate
,
possess
of
fault
,
and
understandably
reserve
in
kindness
towards
a
strange
girl
.
however
,
each
one
have
something
about
they
,
some
interest
or
trait
,
that
make
they
interesting
and
unique
.
the
personal
beauty
of
the
citizen
be
compliment
by
the
beauty
of
the
surroundings
:
the
seaport
town
genuinely
look
impressive
,
capture
the
european
charm
of
a
medieval
city
adapt
to
the
more
modern
need
of
the
1950
's
.
this
beauty
be
beauty
with
depth
;
for
every
detail
leave
in
,
dozen
be
only
hint
at
.
i
could
probably
go
on
all
day
,
but
i
will
not
;
suffice
it
to
say
that
many
of
these
minor
detail
could
have
be
the
highlight
of
the
movie
.
some
of
my
favorite
be
kikus
's
relationship
with
the
baker
's
husband
:
although
he
be
quiet
,
never
show
speak
to
kiki
throughout
the
movie
,
and
he
initially
scare
she
,
he
kindness
win
she
friendship
.
in
the
garage
of
a
deliveree
's
house
can
be
find
a
vintage
model
t
.
two
old
lady
have
a
relationship
evolve
from
master-servant
to
friend-friend
.
such
detail
give
the
impression
that
the
beauty
show
in
the
movie
be
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
.
add
on
top
of
this
be
a
lesson
on
the
importance
of
self-worth
.
kikus
initially
seem
to
derive
much
of
she
self-worth
from
the
beauty
of
she
surroundings
and
the
people
around
she
,
but
a
encounter
with
a
rude
girl
crash
down
she
bewonderment
,
make
she
question
the
importance
of
such
beauty
.
this
cause
kikus
to
lose
faith
in
herself
.
however
,
kikus
come
to
realize
not
only
the
beauty
of
she
surroundings
,
but
the
innate
beauty
inside
she
.
see
kikus
regain
faith
in
herself
be
marvelous
,
and
the
principal
device
use
to
do
it
be
so
sublime
that
i
do
not
even
want
to
hint
at
it
.
the
ending
of
the
movie
have
a
subtle
charm
combine
with
a
sense
of
awe
and
,
ironically
,
the
most
disney-esque
moment
i
have
ever
see
;
if
you
do
not
hold
you
breath
in
wonder
you
might
want
to
get
medical
attention
.
the
movie
steer
free
of
many
of
the
disney
convention
:
there
be
no
violence
,
however
cartoonish
,
no
song-and-dance
number
,
and
kikus
's
pet
cat
jijus
be
more
a
friend
than
a
comedic
sidekick
,
although
jijus
be
give
many
funny
line
and
scene
.
however
,
i
would
be
surprise
if
disney
do
not
give
jijus
more
joke
,
or
at
least
the
voice
of
some
comedian
.
refreshingly
enough
,
the
moral
lesson
of
the
movie
be
not
self-contradicted
,
a
habit
disney
movie
have
get
into
.
''
beauty
and
the
beast
''
's
beautiful
belle
,
for
instance
,
learn
that
beauty
be
derive
from
a
person
's
inside
,
and
be
then
reward
by
have
the
beast
turn
into
a
handsome
prince
in
snazzy
clothing
.
kikus
,
on
the
other
hand
,
learn
to
separate
she
wardrobe
from
she
self-image
,
and
nothing
more
be
make
of
she
early
desire
for
better
clothing
than
illustrate
she
increase
maturity
at
the
end
of
the
film
.
another
difference
with
disney
movie
be
in
the
style
of
animation
for
''
kikus
's
delivery
service
''
:
not
as
colorful
and
dynamic
as
disney
animation
can
be
,
but
with
a
greater
attention
to
realism
and
detail
,
it
fit
the
movie
to
a
t
.
this
be
particularly
true
with
scene
of
kikus
's
flight
.
the
extreme
realism
of
the
bird
in
flight
near
kikus
be
magnificent
to
behold
,
and
help
these
scene
capture
the
wonder
of
flight
better
than
any
other
film
i
have
ever
see
.
i
be
not
sure
when
or
how
this
movie
will
be
release
in
the
united
state
.
disney
tentatively
plan
a
theater
release
of
''
monoko
hime
''
shortly
follow
the
summer
'97
japanese
release
,
and
should
start
release
the
other
ghiblus
film
after
that
.
i
would
guess
that
some
will
be
release
on
video
and
some
will
be
theatrically
release
in
peak
season
with
no
compete
disney
release
.
although
the
wait
be
unfortunate
,
it
be
good
to
know
that
it
be
be
release
at
all
,
for
''
kikus
's
delivery
service
''
be
definitely
a
movie
worthy
of
widespread
promotion
and
release
.
watch
this
movie
.
along
with
''
man
bite
dog
,
''
and
perhaps
something
by
woody
allen
,
this
be
the
best
movie
i
have
ever
see
.
