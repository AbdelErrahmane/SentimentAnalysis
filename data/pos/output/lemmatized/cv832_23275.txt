the

rather
from

a

he

easily
slip

add

the

its
flaw
that
can
be
nitpick

the

do
look
derivative
of

the
dialogue
be
not
the

at

,
reminiscent
of
a
bad

yes
,
the
appearance
of

's
vision
skill
be
more
than
a
little
timely
consider
the
situation
.
these
trappings
be
on
the
periphery
of
the

tell

twohy
may
have
lure
you
in
under
the
pretense
of

but
he
show
the
real
boogieman
