recently
i
read
4
review
of
pleasantville-one
from
entertainment
weekly
,
one
from
a
newsgroup
,
and
two
from
different
online
resource
.
each
review
compare
this
film
to
the
truman
show
.
why
?
the
only
reason
people
compare
pleasantville
to
truman
be
due
to
the
fact
that
they
life
be
on
television
.
other
than
that
,
the
two
movie
be
completely
different
from
each
other
.
reviewer
seem
to
love
to
pick
one
movie
-lrb-
i
.
e
.
the
truman
show
-rrb-
,
obsess
over
it
,
and
make
it
a
guideline
for
other
movie
.
when
pleasantville
and
edtv
open
,
all
critic
seem
to
treat
the
two
film
like
they
be
subject
of
king
truman
.
the
same
go
for
the
thin
red
line
,
as
well
.
when
it
open
in
decemeber
,
probably
98
%
of
review
compare
it
to
stephen
spielberg
's
saving
private
ryan
,
give
thin
line
no
chance
whatsoever
.
critic
love
private
ryan
so
much
,
that
they
automatically
decide
no
movie
be
good
enough
to
reach
its
standard
.
this
be
why
i
think
pleasantville
be
underrated
.
if
the
truman
show
have
never
be
make
,
pleasantville
probably
would
have
receive
better
review
,
do
better
at
the
box
office
,
and
would
be
remember
after
it
be
long
be
on
the
video
store
shelf
.
sure
,
it
be
not
perfect
,
and
it
be
not
very
believeable
,
but
neither
be
the
wizard
of
oz
or
star
war
,
and
there
stand
two
of
the
most
prominent
movie
in
history
.
with
the
exception
of
don
knott
as
the
annoying
''
tv
repairman
''
the
film
be
cast
perfectly
:
the
ice
storm
's
tobey
maguire
be
david
in
real
life
;
he
watch
the
old
50
's
sitcom
''
pleasantville
''
to
escape
from
he
feud
parent
.
he
twin
sister
,
jen
-lrb-
reese
witherspoon
-rrb-
be
a
popular
slut
who
-lrb-
steriotypically
-rrb-
smoke
and
wear
reveal
clothes
.
but
what
make
she
character
believeable
be
the
dialogue-those
excessive
90
's
term
such
as
''
like
''
,
''
whatever
''
,
and
''
cool
''
make
she
sound
like
the
total
dimwit
she
be
suppose
to
be
.
the
twin
,
with
a
little
help
from
a
tv
repairman
-lrb-
casting
don
knott
in
this
role
be
obviously
a
cameo-esque
cast
rather
than
a
true
act
one
-rrb-
,
be
suck
into
pleasantville
by
a
magical
new
remote
.
they
new
parent
,
play
by
william
h
.
macy
and
joan
allen
,
be
perfect
in
every
way
.
they
new
name
be
bud
and
mary
sue
,
and
right
away
they
start
to
corrupt
the
town
of
pleasantville
.
after
the
sibling
fit
comfortably
in
they
new
role
,
the
movie
begin
to
take
form
.
it
be
just
like
watch
a
sitcom
in
itself
;
you
do
not
want
it
to
end
.
''
mary
sue
''
have
sex
with
she
date
,
the
school
basketball
champion
;
when
he
tell
all
he
friend
about
it
,
they
stop
preform
perfectly
at
basketball
,
and
thing
start
to
take
color
.
soon
we
learn
that
these
people
do
not
know
how
to
express
true
emotion
,
and
when
they
learn
to
do
so
,
they
eventually
turn
into
color
.
this
eventually
spark
a
racial
war
between
the
''
colored
''
and
the
''
black
&
whites
.
''
entertainment
weekly
reviewer
lisa
schwarzbaum
claim
the
movie
have
,
''
none
of
the
depth
,
poignance
,
and
brilliance
of
the
truman
show
...
''
yes
,
the
truman
show
be
maybe
a
little
more
intelligent
.
but
the
racial
setting-intensified
by
the
force
of
the
colored
to
sit
in
the
upper
box
of
the
courtroom-certainly
classify
as
deep
,
consider
it
be
what
i
least
expect
.
gary
ross
do
not
try
to
create
a
intelligent
,
award
masterpiece-he
just
try
to
convey
moral
message
within
he
work
.
take
for
example
big
and
dave
,
he
past
film
.
big-be
careful
what
you
wish
for
.
dave-good
or
bad
lie
be
still
lie
.
do
these
movie
win
big
award
?
no
,
but
they
win
the
heart
of
million
.
pleasantville
could
have
do
that
too
,
if
it
be
not
for
snotty
reviewer
who
set
precedent
with
preceed
film
.
