what
be
unique
about
''
wag
the
dog
''
be
that
it
do
not
necessarily
fit
either
of
these
description
,
and
yet
be
both
at
the
same
time
.
the
result
be
a
clever
comedy
base
on
a
original
,
smart
premise
,
even
if
the
focus
do
tend
to
wander
a
bit
.
if
there
be
anything
that
affect
american
the
most
it
be
politics
and
showbusiness
.
in
this
age
of
information
and
technology
,
we
have
be
so
condition
by
the
media
and
the
entertainment
industry
in
we
way
of
perceive
thing
,
it
be
get
to
the
point
that
we
be
practically
control
by
it
.
we
need
the
media
to
bring
we
the
most
up-to-date
news
,
but
we
also
need
the
escapism
of
hollywood
to
counter
all
that
thinking
.
this
film
start
off
well
by
quickly
establish
these
idea
,
and
then
present
a
interesting
scenario
:
if
politics
,
the
media
coverage
of
politics
,
and
the
entertainment
industry
be
so
closely
related
,
could
not
someone
with
the
power
and
authority
to
manipulate
one
of
the
aspect
manipulate
they
all
?
that
be
the
idea

come
up

they
pitch

the

-lrb-
it
be
a
country
no
one

hear
of
so

people

buy
it
-rrb-
.
soon
the
wheel
be
in
motion
and
the
film
's
riff
satire
come
into
play
.
we
be
inundate
with
the
hollywood
mind
set
as
motss
bring
in
a
number
of
expert
to
help
manage
the
situation
,
such
as
a
folk
singer
,
visual
and
sound
effect
technician
,
and
a
modern
style
expert
know
as
the
fad
king
-lrb-
leary
-rrb-
.
the
initial
atmosphere
be
rich
with
numerous
pop
culture
reference
where
everything
somehow
relate
to
something
on
tv
,
in
the
movie
,
or
in
the
news
.
the
character
'
dialogue
be
witty
and
funny
,
although
some
of
the
actual
joke
and
gag
seem
rather
sitcom-esque
.
for
example
,
one
scene
show
motss
and
brean
's
production
crew
film
a
actress
portray
a
poor
albanian
refugee
.
motss
order
a
kitten
for
the
girl
to
carry
,
but
instead
wind
up
with
a
dozen
different
dog
.
since
it
be
all
computer-enhanced
anyway
,
she
end
up
cradle
a
bag
of
tostito
with
the
kitten
to
be
insert
later
.
this
demonstrate
the
film
's
ability
to
take
a
relatively
ordinary
situation
and
make
it
smart
and
funny
just
through
the
premise
.
but
then
there
be
the
gag
and
one-liner
that
,
although
be
humorous
,
seem
a
little
gratuitious
in
the
long
run
such
as
motss
not
be
able
to
remember
the
actress
's
name
,
or
,
whenever
a
problem
emerge
,
always
respond
with
,
''
this
be
nothing
!
''
by
the
time
the
film
make
it
to
the
midpoint
,
everything
that
be
go
to
happen
in
term
of
plot
happen
.
the
first
act
be
quickly
pace
,
while
the
second
act
contain
most
of
the
joke
and
be
the
core
of
the
film
.
every
ten
minute
or
so
a
new
problem
crop
up
that
motss
and
brean
must
deal
with
,
and
it
be
always
fascinating
to
see
what
they
do
and
how
they
do
it
.
the
screenplay
provide
good
characterization
and
actually
deal
with
most
of
the
problem
head-on
in
realistic
manners
.
however
,
it
do
have
a
tendency
to
avoid
thing
and
shift
its
focus
from
the
election
campaign
and
false
war
smokescreen
to
something
a
bit
off
the
subject
.
as
the
third
act
roll
around
the
satirical
nature
become
more
concerned
with
the
situation
and
less
so
with
the
big
picture
.
what
have
start
off
as
a
brilliant
,
somewhat
harmless
conspiracy
to
fool
the
general
public
begin
to
seem
more
like
something
that
would
happen
in
a
movie
.
still
,
the
situation
comedy
be
quite
funny
,
especially
a
montage
show
the
entire
country
fling
old
shoe
into
tree
to
honor
sgt
.
willie
schumann
-
a
war
hero
motss
and
brean
concoct
.
truly
great
satire
manage
to
create
for
a
entertaining
story
that
make
you
laugh
at
the
time
,
but
think
about
afterwards
and
''
wag
the
dog
''
at
least
succeed
in
this
respect
.
however
,
in
retrospect
it
seem
like
so
much
more
could
have
be
do
,
namely
by
extend
the
run
time
and
fill
in
the
plot
hole
.
then
again
,
it
be
a
valiant
effort
.
