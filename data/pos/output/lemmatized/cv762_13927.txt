,
in
essence
,
what

,
where
a
11

-rrb-
want
they
back
.
the
two
spaniard
who
own
''
la

''
want
the
slave
for
themselves
.
the
american
ship
that
find
the

also
want
they
.
in
the
midst
of
this
be
two
abolitionist
-lrb-
stellan
skaarsgard
and
morgan
freeman
-rrb-
,
who
want
the
slave
to
be

.
they
enlist
the
help
of
lawyer
matthew

the
supreme
court
,
where
it
be
argue
by
ex-president
john
quincy
adam
-lrb-
anthony
hopkin
-rrb-
.
the
film
itself
be
a
visual
wonder
.
spielberg
favorite
janusz
kaminskus
set
the
film
in
a
dark
,
somber
mood
when
appropriate
,
and
a
visual
setting
when
appropriate
as
well
.
at
time
,
the
film
be
very
slow
,
and
very
methodical
.
however
,
spielberg
be
not
at
he
finest
here
,
because
the
courtroom
scene
have
a
tendency
to
lag
.
the
film
be
,
in
essence
,
a
courtroom
drama
,
one
whose
event
be
oversimplify
.
the
characterization
be
also
weak
,
display
weakness
in
build
up
character
such
as
the
lawyer
baldwin
-lrb-
mcconaughey
-rrb-
,
and
especially
morgan
freeman
's
abolitionist
.
but
spielberg
's
finest
work
in
the
film
,
the
opening
scene
,
a
scene
of
cinque
's
family
,
and
the
brutal
voyage
of
the
slave
to
america
,
be
altogether
stunning
.
it
be
this
emotional
force
that
carry
the
film
.
mcconaughey
be
superb
as
the
lawyer
defend
the
african
,
hopkin
be
sensational
as
the
old
adam
,
freeman
be
outstanding
when
use
-lrb-
spielberg
vastly
under
use
he
supreme
talent
-rrb-
,
and
the
rest
of
the
cast
be
stellar
.
the
movie
,
however
,
belong
to
hounsou
.
he
emotional
intensity
be
brilliant
.
spielberg
manage
to
make
even
the
slowest
scene
sparkle
with
focus
on
hounsou
,
and
the
film
's
extraordinary
power
be
simply
captivating
.
the
film
be
flaw
,
for
most
of
the
support
character
be
merely
cardboard
.
but
that
do
not
matter
.
the
story
be
a
grip
one
,
and
one
of
extreme
importance
.
kudos
to
spielberg
for
find
it
,
find
the
right
man
for
the
job
,
and
let
the
audience
listen
to
the
word
of
cinque
.
a
good
job
all
around
.
