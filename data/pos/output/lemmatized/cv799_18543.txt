veteran
actor
clint
eastwood
have
never
look
as
grizzled
as
he
do
in
true
crime
,
he
latest
directorial
effort
.
when
steve
everett
-lrb-
he
newest
character
-rrb-
get
angry
at
someone
,
he
glare
they
down
with
those
famous
dirty
harry
eye
,
furrow
he
brow
and
frown
like
a
grizzly
bear
who
be
just
lose
he
cub
.
eastwood
have
play
some
particularly
despicable
character
in
he
time
,
but
everett
could
just
take
the
cake
.
he
get
my
vote
,
at
least
,
partly
because
`
ev
'
be
a
drunken
affair-a-week
womanizer
who
have
many
relationship
problem
,
very
few
of
which
be
with
he
wife
-lrb-
diane
venora
-rrb-
.
when
he
colleague
at
the
oakland
tribune
be
in
a
ugly
car
wreck
and
die
,
everett
must
take
over
for
she
at
a
vital
interview
session
.
the
interview
be
with
frank
beacham
-lrb-
isaiah
washington
-rrb-
,
a
death-row
inmate
set
to
die
at
midnight
for
the
murder
of
a
pregnant
convenience
store
clerk
.
eastwood
furrow
he
brow
.
as
everett
gradually
find
information
,
he
realize
that
beacham
could
very
well
be
innocent
.
he
interview
a
key
witness
-lrb-
michael
jeter
-rrb-
,
who
claim
that
he
burst
in
the
door
at
pocum
's
food
because
he
car
have
overheate
,
only
to
see
beacham
standing
over
the
dead
woman
's
body
,
blood
on
he
suspenders
,
gun
in
hand
.
but
everett
protest
:
how
could
he
have
see
the
gun
,
which
be
lower
by
he
side
,
with
the
potato
chip
rack
in
front
of
he
?
jeter
do
not
know
what
he
be
talk
about
.
eastwood
furrow
he
brow
.
crinkled
expression
and
all
,
clint
be
the
center
of
energy
of
true
crime
.
the
film
be
by
no
mean
a
standard
action\/suspense
yarn
,
but
a
thoughtful
human
story
in
which
the
character
come
before
the
shoot-out
.
isaiah
washington
have
a
break-out
performance
as
frank
beacham
,
and
scene
with
he
and
he
weary
wife
-lrb-
lisa
gay
hamilton
-rrb-
be
truly
heartfelt
moment
.
but
the
best
scene
be
one
that
feature
eastwood
duke
it
out
with
those
in
authority
over
he
.
deni
leary
,
as
everett
's
editor
and
boss
,
have
more
than
a
few
memorable
moment
of
restrained
anger
-lrb-
you
see
,
ev
be
sleep
with
he
wife
-rrb-
.
but
hand
down
,
the
most
enjoyable
segment
of
the
film
be
when
jame
wood
be
on
camera
.
play
the
big
boss
alan
mann
,
wood
and
eastwood
create
amusing
chemistry
and
laugh-out-loud
punchline
.
when
true
crime
opt
for
a
high-speed
chase
to
the
governer
's
house
at
the
finale
,
the
quality
of
film-making
take
a
abrupt
nosedive
.
eastwood
be
so
successful
with
colorful
character
portrait
that
he
do
not
need
to
switch
lane
.
true
crime
be
a
tension-building
,
intriguing
drama
showcase
for
the
talented
director
and
star
.
this
be
a
road
block
he
could
have
easily
dismiss
