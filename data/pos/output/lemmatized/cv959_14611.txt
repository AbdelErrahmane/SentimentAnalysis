a
entertaining
2
hour
await
the
audience
in
this
film
set
in
the
early
80
's
.
sevigny
and
beckinsale
play
disco
chick
alice
and
charlotte
,
who
be
on
the
lookout
for
love
.
alice
be
mousy
,
shy
,
intellectual
,
charlotte
be
bitchy
,
out-going
and
fun
.
we
join
they
adventure
as
they
go
through
a
variety
of
adventure
,
and
man
,
all
to
the
background
of
the
local
disco
.
whit
stillman
have
both
write
and
direct
a
interesting
and
believable
story
.
alice
and
charlotte
be
both
well
write
character
,
and
the
actress
who
play
they
be
not
bad
aswell
.
sevigny
deliver
a
honest
performance
,
and
make
the
audience
feel
for
she
character
.
beckinsale
play
extreme
bitch
personify
,
yet
she
character
never
become
completely
unlikeable
.
the
huge
support
cast
also
play
a
part
in
make
sure
this
movie
be
thoroughly
entertaining
.
the
dialogue
be
sharp
and
well
write
,
with
many
funny
set
piece
.
for
example
,
there
be
a
great
discussion
about
lady
&
the
tramp
by
the
main
character
.
the
disco
tune
play
in
the
background
also
make
sure
that
this
admittedly
long
film
be
good
fun
.
the
direction
be
good
,
bring
out
the
drama
and
comedy
in
the
scene
.
but
they
be
slight
flaw
with
the
movie
.
firstly
,
although
it
be
supposedly
set
in
the
80
's
,
the
character
be
very
,
very
90
's
.
the
way
they
dress
and
act
have
a
very
90
's
feel
to
they
.
although
the
male
hairstyle
look
slightly
80
's
,
frankly
the
80
's
atmosphere
just
be
not
convey
,
which
be
a
shame
.
also
,
as
mention
above
,
the
film
be
too
long
,
and
some
part
do
lag
.
the
charm
of
the
character
do
help
these
moment
,
but
generally
the
editing
could
of
be
a
bit
tighter
.
the
plot
also
side-track
into
a
silly
cocaine
deal
bust
,
which
seem
out
of
place
in
this
movie
.
finally
,
they
be
almost
too
many
character
in
the
film
,
and
despite
the
run
time
,
the
film
never
really
spend
enough
time
on
they
.
some
of
the
character
be
very
slight
,
which
be
a
shame
.
the
conclusion
,
while
funny
,
be
also
surprisingly
weak
,
and
certainly
not
strong
enough
.
but
despite
these
qualm
,
the
last
day
of
disco
be
a
funny
,
warm
movie
,
which
be
certainly
worth
see
,
and
be
a
fitting
homage
to
the
disco
era
of
the
80
's
.
worth
a
look
.
