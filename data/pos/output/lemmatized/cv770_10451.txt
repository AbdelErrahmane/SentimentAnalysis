one
characteristic
unite
these

the

a

there
be
time
when
the

on

than

,
it
be
apparent
that

oscar
do
not
see
gamble
as
a
vice

in

he
believe
that
the
greatest
chance
one
take
in
life
be
bet
one
's
immortal
soul
on
the
truth

ralph
fienne
,
who
normally
play
strong
,
confident
man
,
be
very
much
at
home
as
the
fumbling
,
insecure
oscar
.
the
actor
bring
a
variety
of
nervous
tic
to
the
part
,
all
of
which
subtly
add
to
a
vague
sense
of
discomfort
whenever
oscar
be
on-screen
.
as
good
as
fienne
be
,
however
,
he
be
eclipse
by
cate
blanchett
.
the
actress
,
who
appear
earlier
this
year
as
one
of
the
lead
in
bruce
beresford
's
paradise
road
,
be
mesmerizing
as
lucinda
.
she
give
this
liberated
woman
she
flash
,
and
feed
the
chemistry
between
the
two
lead
character
so
that
it
sparkle
rather
than
fizzle
.
effective
support
be
provide
by
ciaran
hind
-lrb-
the
male
lead
in
jane
austen
's
persuasion
-rrb-
as
lucinda
's
close
friend
,
tom
wilkinson
-lrb-
the
full
monty
-rrb-
as
oscar
's
mentor
,
and
clive
russell
as
a
self-serving
adventurer
.
there
be
a
real
magic
in
the
way
armstrong
develop
the
story
,
keep
thing
move
in
unexpected
direction
without
linger
too
long
on
any
one
moment
or
sequence
.
-lrb-
in
fact
,
i
wish
she
have
devote
a
little
more
time
to
the
luminous
middle
act
,
which
have
oscar
and
lucinda
together
.
-rrb-
with
the
skill
of
a
consummate
storyteller
,
she
weave
romance
,
friendship
,
passion
,
humor
,
and
tragedy
together
into
a
complete
package
.
the
character
,
with
all
of
they
human
foible
and
neurosis
,
be
wonderfully
develop
by
fienne
and
blanchett
.
so
who
care
if
the
storyline
be
a
little
ripe
and
unwieldy
?
oscar
and
lucinda
still
offer
abundant
pleasure
to
reward
the
viewer
.
