faggot
?
what

unfounded
.

really
have
a
heart
.
together
,
they
live
in

.
rico
be
convince
that

,
where
the
sun
shine
beautifully
and
there
be
lot
of
coconut
tree
.

''
we
will
soon
be
in
miamus
''
be
the
last
sentence
utter
in
this
film
and
what
a
shocking
,
move
end
of
a
film
it
be
.
the
classic
theme
music
:
''
midnight
cowboy
''
help
bring
about
the
feeling
of
attachment
that
most
viewer
will
experience
towards
the
end
of
the
film
.
whether
the
attachment
be
to
the
two
main
character
or
to
they
dream
,
be
probably
as
debatable
as
whether
it
be
the
act
or
the
direction
that
make
this
film
so
memorable
.
