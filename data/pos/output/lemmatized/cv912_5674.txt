peter
jackson
's
the
frightener
have
receive
some
notice
for
set
the
record
for
most
computer
effect
ever
in
a
movie
,
and
still
come
in
at
the
extremely
cheap
$
30
million
price
tag
.
but
for
those
who
be
dismay
by
this
year
's
blockbuster
like
twister
and
independence
day
,
the
frightener
have
much
more
to
offer
than
special
effect
.
and
for
those
worried
wether
or
not
peter
jackson
would
compromise
to
hollywood
you
can
rest
easily
.
the
frightener
be
as
far
remove
from
hollywood
as
a
high-profile
movie
can
get
.
michael
j
.
fox
star
as
frank
bannister
,
a
con
artist
who
can
speak
to
ghost
.
he
use
this
ability
to
set
up
a
scam
in
a
small
town
where
he
ghost
buddy
scare
the
hell
out
of
people
,
then
he
come
and
pretend
to
get
rid
of
they
.
this
be
how
he
have
make
a
living
ever
since
he
wife
die
in
a
car
crash
5
year
ago
.
frank
's
latest
customer
be
a
young
couple
,
play
by
trinus
alvarado
and
peter
dobson
.
when
dobson
end
up
dead
,
alvarado
start
to
take
a
interest
in
fox
.
but
dobson
's
spirit
be
still
around
as
he
refuse
to
beleive
he
be
dead
.
this
lead
to
a
very
awkward
and
amusing
dinner
date
between
fox
and
alvarado
,
with
dobson
tagging
along
as
a
ghost
.
thing
start
get
complicate
for
fox
when
he
be
accuse
for
a
series
of
murder
take
place
in
the
town
.
fox
see
someone
name
the
soul
collector
crush
the
heart
of
the
victim
,
but
noone
else
can
see
that
.
so
when
fox
show
up
to
try
and
save
each
victim
,
naturally
people
suspect
he
be
the
killer
.
fox
see
that
alvarado
be
next
on
the
soul
collector
's
hit
list
,
and
the
last
half
hour
of
the
movie
deal
with
fox
's
attempt
to
save
she
from
this
evil
spirit
.
there
be
many
wonderful
twist
and
turn
in
the
screenplay
write
by
peter
jackson
and
france
walsh
.
the
movie
start
off
as
a
black
comedy
,
and
end
up
a
horror-action
film
.
the
mix
between
these
genre
be
perfect
.
no
laugh
be
sacrifice
in
the
name
of
horror
,
and
vice
versa
.
one
point
of
contention
might
be
a
lackluster
score
by
danny
elfman
.
but
that
hardly
seem
like
a
flaw
when
you
have
such
a
diverse
cast
all
in
top
form
.
michael
j
.
fox
deliver
one
of
he
best
performance
to
date
as
a
man
who
hide
the
sorrow
of
he
wife
's
death
,
and
then
be
force
to
confront
this
later
on
.
alvarado
,
look
like
andie
macdowell
,
make
a
great
frightened
,
tough
,
and
smart
heroine
.
and
jeffery
comb
,
as
a
paranoid
fbus
agent
,
be
brilliantly
bizaare
.
the
frightener
never
once
feel
like
it
be
run
long
.
the
first
hour
be
as
funny
as
any
comedy
this
year
,
and
the
last
half
hour
be
as
thrilling
as
any
of
the
big
budget
blockbuster
.
this
movie
be
probably
what
casper
would
have
look
like
if
david
lynch
direct
it
.
it
be
easily
the
best
film
of
the
year
,
so
far
.
