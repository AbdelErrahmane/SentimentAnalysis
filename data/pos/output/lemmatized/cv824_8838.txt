in
may
of
1977
,
just
2
year
after
steven
spielberg
's
success
with
jaw
and
3
year
after
franci
coppola
'
the
godfather
,
a
risky
,
ambitious
young
director
name
george
luca
go
for
the
same
unpredictable
box
office
success
.
little
do
he
know
that
star
war
would
become
the
greatest
science
fiction
epic
in
the
history
of
film
.
in
January
of
this
year
,
luca
re-released
star
war
on
its
20th
anniversary
.
in
this
new
,
remastered
version
,
the
added
effect
,
which
range
from
leathery
desert
beast
insert
into
already
exist
shot
to
a
awkward
new
scene
in
which
han
solo
bargain
he
way
out
of
a
jam
with
a
computer-generated
jabba
the
hutt
,
do
not
do
much
but
call
attention
to
themselves
.
other
than
these
,
the
film
be
exactly
the
same
.
why
pay
to
see
it
in
the
theater
,
you
might
ask
?
simply
because
when
this
movie
be
release
,
most
of
we
be
a
few
year
short
of
be
bear
.
we
should
all
get
up
and
go
to
the
movie
for
the
experience
,
especially
if
you
have
not
see
it
.
the
plot
be
basic
but
in
the
same
way
,
complex
.
it
have
many
theme
,
but
the
one
rotate
around
luke
skywalker
-lrb-
mark
hamill
-rrb-
and
he
quest
to
become
a
jedus
knight
.
he
mission
begin
when
a
droid
name
r2-d2
play
back
a
secret
message
record
by
the
beautiful
princess
leium
-lrb-
carrie
fisher
-rrb-
,
which
tell
he
to
contact
the
mysterious
obi-wan
kanoby
-lrb-
alec
guiness
-rrb-
.
he
and
kanoby
then
,
join
by
two
inter-galactic
renegade
,
han
solo
-lrb-
harrison
ford
-rrb-
and
chewbacca
,
and
skywalker
's
two
droid
d2
and
c3po
-lrb-
the
voice
of
anthony
edward
-rrb-
,
wage
war
upon
the
corrupt
empire
,
command
by
a
evil
general
-lrb-
peter
cushing
-rrb-
and
the
traitorous
darth
vader
-lrb-
the
voice
of
jame
earl
jone
-rrb-
.
skywalker
defeat
the
evil
empire
by
rise
out
of
himself
to
embrace
something
larger
:
the
force
.
the
film
be
obviously
quite
star-studded
.
but
how
be
luca
to
know
that
ford
would
become
one
of
the
most
seek
after
man
in
hollywood
and
jone
'
voice
would
appear
so
many
more
time
in
the
future
?
it
just
happen
to
work
out
for
he
.
the
magic
of
star
war
lie
in
the
way
that
skywalker
's
triumph
be
symbolize
by
the
audience
's
sense
of
become
something
larger
than
life
itself-a
universe
of
fan
,
young
and
old
,
recreate
a
movie
atmosphere
that
will
impress
generation
forever
.
