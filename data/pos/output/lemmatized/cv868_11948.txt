city
of
angel
be
the
kind
of
love
story
that
i
enjoy
the
most
:
thought-provoking
,
move
,
and
completely
unsentimental
.
i
find
it
interesting
that
this
film
have
be
release
the
same
day
as
my
giant
,
which
be
a
film
that
be
undo
completely
by
its
wretched
sentimentality
.
city
of
angel
be
a
wonderful
film
,
enhance
by
interesting
and
well-rounded
character
and
some
of
the
most
immersive
imagery
of
the
last
couple
of
year
.
it
be
a
love
story
that
take
the
familiar
angel
theme
and
make
they
new
and
necessary
to
the
story
,
and
avoid
most
of
the
cliche
we
be
so
use
to
see
in
film
like
this
.
city
of
angel
be
a
apparently
loose
remake
of
wim
wender
'
1988
film
wing
of
desire
.
i
have
yet
to
see
wing
of
desire
,
so
i
be
,
unfortunately
,
unable
to
make
a
comparison
of
the
two
.
i
have
hear
,
however
,
that
city
of
angel
be
dissimilar
from
the
original
in
numerous
way
,
which
make
I
glad
that
this
film
be
not
a
rip-off
of
its
source
material
.
nicola
cage
star
as
seth
,
a
angel
who
,
like
all
of
he
angel
counterpart
,
be
present
to
lead
the
die
to
heaven
-lrb-
or
somewhere
just
like
it
-rrb-
.
one
day
,
he
be
force
to
take
the
life
of
a
patient
of
dr
.
maggie
rice
-lrb-
meg
ryan
-rrb-
,
and
he
attention
be
call
to
she
.
the
angel
can
make
themselves
see
to
human
,
but
they
can
not
experience
any
of
the
sens
-lrb-
most
importantly
,
touch
-rrb-
.
he
show
himself
to
maggie
,
and
she
fall
for
he
,
unaware
that
he
be
slightly
unavailable
because
of
he
apparition
status
.
seth
want
to
become
human
so
he
can
feel
she
.
that
be
when
he
meet
nathaniel
messinger
-lrb-
denni
franz
-rrb-
,
''
former
celestial
messenger
and
recent
addition
to
the
human
race
.
''
-lrb-
as
a
side
note
,
i
find
messinger
to
be
the
most
fascinating
character
,
for
i
can
only
imagine
how
incredibly
liberating
it
must
be
to
live
know
what
lie
beyond
death
.
-rrb-
messinger
explain
to
seth
that
it
be
possible
for
angel
to
become
human
.
seth
manage
to
convince
maggie
that
he
be
a
angel
-lrb-
i
know
,
it
sound
ridiculous
,
but
the
scene
in
which
she
find
out
be
exceptionally
well-done
-rrb-
;
after
much
deliberation
,
she
tell
he
that
she
could
only
be
with
a
man
who
can
feel
.
this
,
of
course
,
be
when
seth
decide
to
take
the
plunge
-lrb-
literally
-rrb-
from
a
building
;
when
he
wake
up
from
the
fall
,
he
be
human
,
and
happy
to
feel
what
it
be
like
to
have
a
split
lip
and
blood
ooze
from
he
forehead
.
since
i
love
this
film
so
much
,
i
'll
make
a
minor
note
that
it
certainly
be
not
perfect
.
although
it
be
original
and
mesmerizing
,
it
do
fall
prey
to
a
few
of
the
cliche
of
the
genre
.
the
plot
of
the
story
by
writer
dawn
steel
be
rather
formulaic
-lrb-
though
the
detail
be
what
make
the
story
excellent
,
and
steel
have
do
a
great
job
with
they
-rrb-
.
the
end
,
too
,
could
have
be
more
powerful
and
less
predictable
.
these
element
be
minor
,
though
,
and
barely
detract
from
my
overall
enjoyment
of
city
of
angel
.
the
acting
be
superb
from
everyone
involve
.
this
be
perhaps
my
second-favorite
performance
from
cage
-lrb-
my
favorite
be
the
rock
-rrb-
.
he
be
quiet
and
pensive
,
and
he
eye
be
engage
when
he
speak
he
softly-toned
word
.
he
be
perfect
for
a
role
like
this
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
reassure
we
he
be
not
bind
by
play
the
psycho
-lrb-
though
he
be
good
at
it
,
as
he
show
in
face\/off
-rrb-
.
meg
ryan
be
a
powerful
,
entice
,
and
appealingly-chirpy
actress
,
and
she
work
here
be
some
of
she
best
.
denni
franz
,
however
,
steal
all
of
he
scene
as
the
energetic
former-angel
.
what
i
admire
most
about
city
of
angel
be
its
overall
presentation
.
director
brad
silberling
be
a
talented
man
,
and
he
know
that
a
story
like
this
be
drive
by
the
character
,
rather
than
force
sentimentality
.
he
direction
be
steady
,
and
he
show
this
in
just
about
every
scene
:
near
the
beginning
,
maggie
have
to
tell
a
mother
and
she
two
child
that
they
father
be
dead
.
there
be
no
music
or
elaborate
camera
work
;
we
simply
see
the
reaction
of
the
character
to
the
information
.
this
be
the
way
story
should
be
tell
,
and
the
strength
of
scene
resonate
more
completely
when
the
emotion
be
real
.
the
film
also
appeal
to
the
sens
in
a
way
that
few
love
story
do
.
cinematographer
john
seale
-lrb-
the
english
patient
-rrb-
provide
some
of
the
most
stunning
image
i
have
see
on
the
big
screen
:
hundred
of
black-clad
angel
stand
on
a
dim
beach
in
the
early
morning
hour
-lrb-
just
as
a
example
-rrb-
.
the
music
,
by
gabriel
yare
-lrb-
also
of
the
english
patient
-rrb-
,
be
perfect
for
this
film
:
it
be
quiet
and
moody
music
-lrb-
but
not
sentimental
!
-rrb-
,
and
add
to
the
atmosphere
and
tone
nicely
.
the
visual
presentation
of
city
of
angel
be
easily
the
best
of
1998
so
far
.
all
of
this
add
up
to
a
film
that
be
instantly
set
apart
from
other
member
of
this
genre
.
it
be
a
film
that
rely
on
character
development
and
imagery
to
get
the
story
across
--
the
excellent
actor
and
the
professional
production
value
make
city
of
angel
one
of
those
rare
film
that
both
entertain
and
instigate
think
simultaneously
.
