scream
2
,
like
its
predecessor
,
be
a
genre-crossing
film
.
it
be
about
50
%
horror
film
and
50
%
murder
mystery
.
the
mix
work
very
well
last
time
and
it
continue
to
entertain
this
time
.
scream
be
also
know
for
its
self-referential
tone
.
many
inside
joke
be
make
in
reference
to
horror
movie
and
we
craven
.
again
,
scream
2
follow
suit
with
character
say
such
thing
as
''
sequel
suck
''
and
''
the
entire
horror
genre
be
destroy
by
sequel
.
''
scream
2
's
story
be
very
similar
to
it
be
predecessor
's
.
sidney
-lrb-
neve
campbell
-rrb-
,
have
survive
the
killing
spree
in
scream
,
be
now
in
college
.
gale
weather
-lrb-
courteney
cox
-rrb-
have
write
a
book
about
the
murder
and
that
book
be
now
be
release
as
a
feature
film
,
call
stab
-lrb-
which
for
all
practical
purpose
be
the
real-world
movie
scream
-rrb-
.
at
the
premiere
of
stab
,
two
student
from
sidney
's
college
be
stab
to
death
,
and
a
new
story
begin
.
the
press
descend
on
sidney
and
she
college
to
get
the
scoop
on
this
sequel
killer
.
they
want
to
know
all
about
the
link
between
stab
,
sidney
,
and
the
recent
murder
.
the
most
complex
self-reference
i
saw
-lrb-
this
should
be
a
olympic
event
-rrb-
be
the
scene
where
gale
weather
be
ask
question
at
a
press
conference
.
the
rest
of
the
press
be
watch
and
videotape
weather
.
the
other
survivor
from
scream
be
watch
and
videotape
the
press
.
the
audience
be
watch
the
whole
,
film
scene
.
-lrb-
whew
.
-rrb-
the
movie
be
pack
with
layer
and
self-reference
that
make
it
a
pleasure
to
watch
.
even
better
would
be
to
watch
a
double
feature
of
scream
and
scream
2
.
that
be
not
to
say
that
these
reference
necessarily
make
scream
2
a
deep
,
or
even
a
good
movie
.
the
just
add
to
the
fun
of
watch
it
.
i
recommend
it
for
other
reason
as
well
.
what
i
like
best
about
the
horror
aspect
of
the
movie
be
that
the
monster
be
not
supernatural
.
no
werewolf
or
ghost
or
psycho
with
superhuman
strength
be
responsible
.
it
be
a
person
in
a
mask
and
a
robe
,
he
only
advantage
the
fear
he
strike
into
he
victim
.
no
extraordinary
leap
of
faith
be
need
to
believe
in
the
killer
.
the
down
side
be
that
if
you
be
frighten
by
horror
movie
,
you
have
less
grounds
to
say
''
it
be
just
a
movie
.
''
the
whodunit
aspect
of
the
movie
be
not
that
great
by
itself
-
gale
weather
and
deputy
dewey
-lrb-
david
arquette
,
also
from
the
original
-rrb-
track
down
a
killer
.
they
be
likeable
,
but
not
outstanding
.
but
in
combination
with
the
horror
aspect
,
the
whodunit
be
a
perfect
counterpoint
.
it
be
exactly
a
year
ago
today
that
i
write
the
review
for
scream
.
the
internet
movie
database
say
that
scream
3
be
in
the
work
,
so
i
wonder
if
i
'll
be
do
the
same
thing
on
January
1
,
1999
.
if
craven
and
screenwriter
kevin
williamson
be
able
to
keep
the
quality
high
,
i
'll
be
happy
to
mark
my
calendar
.
