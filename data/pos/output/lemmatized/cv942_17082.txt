it
be
always
refreshing
to
see
a
superstar
actor
who
get
pay
more
than
enough
to
forget
about
work
for
a
live
to
want
to
take
a
chance
and
play
a
less-than-savoury
character
as
mel
gibson
do
in
payback
.
of
course
,
if
i
be
be
pay
$
25
million
for
one
month
's
work
,
i
would
probably
be
willing
to
take
risk
as
well
,
but
that
be
neither
here
nor
there
.
payback
be
base
on
a
novel
by
richard
stark
-lrb-
apparently
actually
donald
e
.
westlake
,
author
of
the
grifter
,
itself
a
fine
crime
film
-rrb-
which
be
also
film
in
the
1960
as
point
blank
star
one
of
the
toughest
of
tough
guy
,
lee
marvin
.
the
film
open
with
gibson
have
recover
from
be
shoot
several
time
in
the
back
,
by
whom
we
do
not
know
yet
.
all
we
know
be
that
gibson
,
as
porter
,
be
not
a
happy
chappy
and
be
hellbent
on
get
the
money
steal
from
he
back
,
and
get
even
in
the
process
,
no
matter
what
the
consequence
.
it
turn
out
that
the
man
he
be
after
be
val
-lrb-
gregg
henry
-rrb-
,
he
sometime
partner
with
whom
he
steal
a
briefcase
full
of
cash
from
a
gang
of
chinese
mobster
.
obviously
not
have
much
of
a
crisis
of
the
soul
,
val
figure
porter
be
dead
and
go
about
use
he
share
of
the
money
to
pay
off
a
debt
to
he
employer
.
porter
,
however
,
be
the
sort
of
man
who
hold
a
grudge
and
once
on
he
foot
,
go
about
exact
revenge
on
the
double-crossing
val
.
gibson
give
a
terrific
performance
in
the
sort
of
role
which
he
be
bear
to
play
,
that
of
a
slightly
unhinge
guy
who
do
not
mind
beat
up
or
shooting
people
to
get
what
he
want
.
you
probably
would
not
see
other
actor
in
he
salary
range
take
such
a
offbeat
,
out-of-character
role
such
as
porter
-lrb-
jim
carrey
will
not
be
do
anything
like
this
in
a
hurry
after
what
happen
the
last
time
he
try
-
the
cable
guy
,
anyone
?

harrison
ford
's
idea
of
play
a
unsympathetic
character
be
presume
innocent
;
the
last
time
schwarzenegger
play
a
villain
be
batman
and
robin
,
which
we
will
not
mention
further
;
and
have
stallone
ever
really
play
a
villain
at
all
?
this
be
not
to
say
that
porter
be
a
villain
,
per
se
.
while
he
be
not
the
sort
of
character
you
would
not
want
to
get
on
the
wrong
side
of
,
he
be
nothing
compare
to
some
of
the
one
we
be
force
to
watch
in
countless
bad
thriller
and
action
film
where
they
kill
innocent
people
in
the
blink
of
a
eye
or
execute
they
right-hand
man
just
to
prove
how
mean
they
be
.
porter
be
only
try
to
get
back
what
be
not-so-rightfully
he
,
which
in
a
way
be
almost
understandable
.
payback
be
a
enjoyable
dramatic
black
comedy-thriller
which
will
not
be
remember
as
be
among
gibson
's
most
important
work
,
but
be
still
one
of
the
finer
film
he
be
do
.
the
only
real
problem
with
it
be
that
,
while
everything
seem
to
work
out
in
the
end
,
i
be
leave
feeling
something
be
lack
;
be
that
all
?
the
end
look
as
if
it
be
tack
on
at
the
last
minute
,
and
the
final
voice-over
do
not
ring
true
,
even
though
it
be
use
to
good
effect
elsewhere
in
the
film-noir
style
the
rest
of
the
film
embody
.
the
film
just
end
far
too
suddenly
,
after
a
huge
build-up
in
the
penultimate
scene
.
a
fine
film
,
even
though
it
need
just
a
little
something
more
to
be
the
kind
of
a
film
that
can
be
recommend
without
hesitation
.
just
be
ready
for
a
possible
letdown
of
a
end
.
