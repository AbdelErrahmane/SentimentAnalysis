where

''
differ
most
from
''

''
be
,
as
expect
,
in
the
scope
of
the
project
.
there
be
a
big
difference
,
budget-wise
,
between
make
a
television
docudrama
and
one
that
go
to
the
big

.
it
show
as
the
maker
of
''

''
craft
a
recreation
of
the
cuban
missile
crisis
that
encompass
not
only
the
political

within
the
white
house
,
it
also
depict
the
event
that
take
place
as
america
gird
itself
for

confrontation
.
the
cast
,
a
true
ensemble
,
be
lead
,
surprisingly
,
by
bruce
greenwood
as
jfk
and
not
by
kevin
costner
.
costner
's
o'donnell
represent
the
family
guy
thing
as
the
drama
of
the
crisis
have
its
impact
on
he
and
he
family
.
this
put
a
personal
spin
on
the
film
as
we
see
both
the
crisis
and
america
's
preparation
for
war
and
the
pressure
it
bring
to
bear
on
those
in
the
know
.
kenny
reassure
he
wife
and
kid
that
all
will
be
okay

they
will
be
safe
,
but
he
know
that
,
if
the
crisis
come
to
a
head
,
he
family
will
be
no
more
.
the
meat
of
''
thirteen
day
''
be
in
the
big
picture
,
not
the
microcosm
of
family
,
though
.
this
be
where
the
film
stand
out
as
we
see
the
workings
of
we
government
on
the
highest
level
.
the
story
do
not
just
cover
the
face-off
between
the
world
's
two
most
powerful
country
;
it
also
depict
the
animosity
between
the
president
and
the
military\/cia
.
the
disaster
of
the
bay
of
pig
invasion
the
year
before
leave
a
distrustful
taste
in
the
mouth
of
the
general
and
admiral
who
blame
the
kennedy
for
not
back
the
cuban
expatriate
fight
fidel
castro
.
the
missile
crisis
become
a
struggle
for
power
as
the
army\/navy\/air
force
want
to
flex
they
might
and
invade
cuba
,
while
jfk
want
to
end
the
confrontation
peaceably
but
with
america
's
dignity
and
world
leadership
intact
.
while
the
internal
battle
for
power
rage
in

force
chief
curti
lemay
-lrb-
kevin
conway
-rrb-
advise
the
president
to
bomb
cuba
into
the
stone
age
,
we
armed
force
be
set
into
motion
to
stop
the
soviet
with
a
blockade
of
offensive
weapon
to
cuba
.
this
be
where
the
political
intrigue
of
high
office
be
replace
by
exciting
action
.
when
the
first
confrontation
take
place
between
a
we
warship
and
a
soviet
freighter
,
the
tension
be
palpable
.
the
most
involve
action
sequence
take
place
late
in
the
game
as
another
u2
be
send
up
to
shoot
some
snap
of
the
buildup
and
the
fully
prepared
soviet
force
launch
a
anti-aircraft
attack
on
the
hapless
pilot
of
the
spy
plane
.
this
be
a
sweaty
palm
sequence
to
say
the
least
,
make
you
squirm
in
you
seat
as
you
try
to
help
the
pilot
avoid
those
missile
.
the
ensemble
cast
place
greenwood
as
the
first

to
all
the
principle

be
a
caricature
of

a
powerful
figure
who
have
to
maintain
the
dignity
of
the
office
,
direct
he
subordinate
but
give
they
the
latitude
to
make
clear
all
of
he
option
.

all
the
option
available
to
the
president

be
really
a
support
cast
member
