in
_
daylight
_
,
sylvester
stallone
break
no
new
ground
,
cinematically
speak
,
but
he
cover
familiar
territory
quite
well
.
yesterday
,
as
i
be
go
about
my
business
in
the
university
bookstore
,
i
notice
this
stand
with
these
_
daylight
_
movie
poster
on
it
.
i
have
never
hear
of
the
movie
,
so
i
stop
by
to
check
it
out
.
it
turn
out
that
they
be
give
away
free
pass
to
the
movie
for
people
who
have
or
apply
for
the
credit
card
they
be
offer
.
so
,
i
shrug
,
think
,
''
hey
,
they
probably
will
not
give
I
the
card
anyway
,
and
i
could
always
use
a
free
movie
,
''
so
i
sign
up
.
all
in
all
,
i
do
not
think
i
get
that
bad
of
a
deal
,
either
.
rob
cohen
,
who
have
previously
bring
we
such
film
as
_
dragon
:
the
bruce
lee
story
_
and
,
more
recently
,
_
dragonheart
_
-lrb-
gee
,
i
wonder
if
he
like
dragon
for
some
reason
?
you
think
?
-rrb-
,
now
bring
we
a
very
nicely
execute
disaster
picture
,
with
fx
by
industrial
light
and
magic
,
about
the
after-effect
of
a
explosion
that
collapse
a
busy
tunnel
between
new
york
and
new
jersey
.
sylvester
stallone
play
kit
latura
,
who
be
essentially
a
carbon
copy
of
the
character
he
play
in
_
cliffhanger
_
:
a
paramedic
on
the
out
because
he
make
a
mistake
that
get
people
kill
.
when
the
crisis
hit
,
he
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
and
take
it
upon
himself
to
go
in
and
get
everybody
out
.
there
be
other
similarity
to
_
cliffhanger
_
,
too
;
perhaps
the
only
real
difference
be
that
_
cliffhanger
_
have
a
villain
,
where
_
daylight
_
's
bad
guy
be
mother
nature
.
in
fact
,
have
the
two
movie
be
make
in
hong
kong
,
this
might
have
be
title
_
cliffhanger
ii
_
--
it
bear
the
same
relationship
to
that
film
that
most
hk
film
''
sequel
''
do
to
they
predecessor
.
the
first
half-hour
of
_
daylight
_
be
setup
.
subplot
be
weave
,
and
the
mechanism
of
the
disaster
be
assemble
.
we
meet
all
the
important
people
...
toxic
waste
disposal
truck
driver
;
a
young
,
frustrated
,
jilted
,
reject
playwright
;
a
family
struggle
to
stay
together
;
a
older
couple
and
they
dog
;
a
truckload
of
prisoner
;
a
ad
agency
executive
;
a
tunnel
police
officer
;
stallone
;
and
other
.
we
watch
the
truck
trundle
toward
they
destination
;
we
watch
stallone
and
so
many
other
drive
toward
the
tunnel
for
they
various
reason
.
and
then
,
thirty
minute
into
the
film
,
_
boom
_
.
and
it
be
a
big
one
.
-rrb-
from
there
on
in
,
it
be
sly
stallone
to
the
rescue
.
and
rescue
he
do
,
endure
battering
,
beating
,
fall
,
repeat
immersion
in
34-degree
water
,
explosion
,
mud
,
rat
,
and
constant
setback
,
before
go
on
to
save
the
day
,
sly-style
.
again
...
there
be
nothing
new
here
.
and
yet
there
do
not
need
to
be
.
the
fun
of
_
daylight
_
be
not
in
the
story
but
in
the
execution
.
the
special-effect
be
first-rate
,
thanks
to
industrial
light
and
magic
,
and
the
ensemble
cast
work
well
together
.
once
the
film
hit
its
stride
,
it
carry
the
viewer
right
along
to
the
finish
,
with
very
few
jar
along
the
way
.
