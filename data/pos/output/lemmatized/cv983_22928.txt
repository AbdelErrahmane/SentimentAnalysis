few
film
in
1999
have
divide
the
critical
consensus
as
sharply
as
alan
parker
's
adaptation
of
frank
mccourt
's
memoir
angelum
's
ash
.
many
dismiss
it
as
a
humorless
,
sentimentalize
,
uninteresting
version
of
the
hugely
popular
novel
;
other
hail
it
as
a
heartfelt
,
sincere
portrait
of
the
human
spirit
.
i
be
somewhere
in
between
,
lean
strongly
towards
the
latter
.
it
be
certainly
well-made
and
it
never
become
tedious
like
some
literary
adaptation
have
a
tendency
to
be
.
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
parker
fill
the
movie
with
pseudo-lyrical
shot
of
rain
fall
on
the
homely
street
of
ireland
just
so
it
can
have
the
two-and-a-half
hour
run
time
that
scream
''
i
be
important

the
film
's
final
message
be
somewhat
conflicted
,
as
frankie
,
in
effect
,
leave
he
family
famish
in
ireland
while
he
himself
go
back
to
america
.
what
,
exactly
,
be
we
suppose
to
make
of
that
?
he

do
not
seem
to
mind
because
she
want
the
best
possible
future
for
she
son
,
as
any
mother
would
,
but
it
still
seem
inconsiderate
of
he
.
i
have
not
read
the
book
,
but
i
be
sure
that
mccourt
justify
he
action
therein
;
therefore
,
i
be
suspicious
.
another
thing
that
be
never
make
clear
in
the
movie
be
the
meaning
of
the
title
,
which
,
i
be
sure
,
be
also
explain
in
the
memoir
.
if
see
as
a
film
onto
itself
,
rather
than
a
adaptation
,
angelum
's
ash
stand
tall
.
despite
a
few
minor
setback
,
it
be
a
captivating
story
of
people
force
to
live
in
the
trench
by
a
merciless
society
where
those
of
weaker
character
be
shove
to
the
bottom
of
the
financial
ladder
.
