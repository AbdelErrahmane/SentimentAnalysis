let
's
say
you
live
at
the
end
of
a
airport
runway
.
large
jetliner
continuously
pass
over
you
house
,
rattle
you
window
and
allow
few
moment
of
peace
.
let
's
say
the
ground
beneath
you
foot
be
also
contaminate
with
toxic
substance
,
and
high
voltage
power
line
run
across
steel
tower
only
yard
from
you
home
.
now
let
's
say
a
airport
conglomerate
want
to
buy
you
property
in
order
to
lengthen
the
runway
,
and
offer
you
more
than
it
be
worth
.
would
not
you
jump
in
the
air
and
have
you
bag
pack
before
you
land
?
of
course
you
would
.
but
what
if
this
bit
of
land
be
you
idea
of
paradise
,
and
the
house
you
castle
?
that
be
what
they
be
to
darryl
kerrigan
-lrb-
michael
caton
-rrb-
,
and
although
he
be
happy
that
a
multi-national
corporation
would
like
to
buy
he
home
,
sorry
,
it
be
not
for
sale
.
unfortunately
,
the
corporation
wield
quite
a
bit
of
influence
over
the
australian
government
,
which
serve
darryl
and
he
family
with
what
amount
to
a
eviction
notice
.
not
about
to
take
this
lie
down
,
darryl
enlist
the
help
of
he
inept
attorney
friend
denni
denuto
-lrb-
tiriel
mora
-rrb-
and
make
a
determine
,
albeit
pathetic
,
attempt
to
fight
back
.
the
castle
,
a
australian
comedy
by
rob
sitch
,
be
perhaps
one
of
the
simplest
movie
i
have
see
in
recent
memory
,
yet
also
one
of
the
funniest
.
in
fact
,
it
be
this
film
's
reliance
on
simplicity
which
make
it
so
successful
.
the
good
guy
and
the
bad
guy
be
clear
,
the
humor
be
straightforward
,
and
the
storyline
be
as
uncomplicated
as
it
get
.
it
be
the
perfect
setup
for
a
relaxing
,
hilarious
good
time
,
and
as
much
as
i
hate
to
admit
it
,
i
like
the
fact
that
i
do
not
have
to
think
all
that
much
while
watch
this
film
.
i
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
myself
.
the
situation
be
one
we
have
see
before
:
regular
joe
fight
back
against
the
government
,
or
big
business
,
or
whatever
.
what
make
this
film
different
be
its
character
.
darryl
think
he
be
get
the
best
life
in
the
world
-
he
tell
he
family
that
live
next
to
power
line
be
a
constant
reminder
of
the
success
of
mankind
,
he
ask
who
would
ever
want
to
go
out
and
eat
in
a
fancy
restaurant
when
he
be
get
the
meat
loaf
feast
prepare
by
he
wife
sal
-lrb-
anne
tenny
-rrb-
,
and
he
swell
with
pride
when
he
son
dale
-lrb-
stephen
curry
-rrb-
dig
a
hole
in
the
yard
.
steve
kerrigan
-lrb-
anthony
simcoe
-rrb-
constantly
comb
the
buy
and
sell
ad
look
for
''
investment
''
like
joust
stick
and
overhead
projector
,
while
wayne
kerrigan
be
in
jail
,
as
a
result
of
denni
denuto
's
incompetent
courtroom
maneuver
.
the
great
thing
about
the
kerrigan
be
that
they
be
not
so
stupid
that
they
get
annoying
.
they
be
just
a
group
of
simpleton
whose
naive
nature
be
perfectly
harmless
and
even
endearing
.
we
look
upon
they
with
a
little
bit
of
pity
,
but
a
whole
lot
of
affection
.
screenwriter
sitch
,
santo
cilauro
,
tom
gleisner
,
and
jane
kennedy
pit
this
lovable
bunch
of
unlikely
crusader
against
a
stoic
court
system
and
a
condescending
business
conglomerate
,
further
polarize
the
extreme
and
deepen
we
feeling
for
the
kerrigan
.
sympathy
for
they
situation
,
the
laughter
they
bring
we
,
and
the
family
's
wonderful
characterization
,
simple
as
it
may
be
,
leave
we
with
a
degree
of
emotional
investment
that
cause
we
to
actually
care
about
what
happen
to
they
.
i
suppose
one
might
wonder
how
deep
characterization
can
go
when
you
character
be
as
inane
as
the
kerrigan
,
but
trust
I
,
it
work
.
i
particularly
note
that
the
writer
do
not
have
to
use
slapstick
in
order
to
get
laugh
.
do
not
get
I
wrong
-
slapstick
,
when
execute
well
,
can
be
genius
.
it
be
just
that
too
often
,
a
film
will
resort
to
it
be
use
as
a
shortcut
to
amusing
the
audience
,
not
always
successfully
.
instead
,
the
joke
in
the
castle
be
all
hinge
upon
the
dialog
utter
by
these
people
who
have
no
idea
that
they
be
totally
skewed
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
when
they
be
by
themselves
,
the
be
funny
,
and
when
they
be
with
normal
people
,
they
be
hilarious
.
one
of
the
few
problem
i
see
with
this
film
be
a
detour
take
about
midway
though
.
the
kerrigan
go
out
to
a
vacation
spot
for
seemingly
no
reason
other
than
to
pack
in
a
few
more
joke
and
increase
the
film
's
run
time
.
luckily
,
it
be
a
funny
little
detour
that
,
while
slightly
distract
from
the
film
's
main
drive
,
be
still
quite
enjoyable
.
with
all
the
levity
abound
in
the
castle
,
the
film
still
manage
to
take
on
a
pretty
heavy
concept
,
that
of
the
innate
right
of
a
citizen
to
keep
he
property
,
a
issue
which
have
be
bandy
about
in
court
across
the
civilized
world
with
differ
outcome
.
i
be
not
certain
the
courtroom
monologue
near
the
end
of
the
film
would
actually
hold
up
in
real
life
,
but
it
bring
to
the
forefront
the
essence
of
the
constitution
-lrb-
of
australium
-rrb-
and
certainly
sound
impressive
at
any
rate
.
and
,
for
that
matter
,
it
be
more
than
i
would
have
expect
out
of
a
light
hearted
film
like
this
.
