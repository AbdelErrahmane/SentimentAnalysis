the
chemistry

remarkable
.
the
performance
be
all
acceptable
within
the
whimsical
level
of
the
film

performance
be
as
good
as
anything

.
he
innocence
be
refreshing
and
fun
.
a
bad
guy
that
be
not
really
bad
.
he
scene
with
jackie
be
some
of
the
best
bit
of
comic
dueling
since
martin
and
lewi
.
lucy
liu
as
princess
peus
peus
be
give
little
to
do
in
the
script
,
but
for
a
change
do
not
play
a
nymphet
or
some
other
deviant
.
the
character
be
a
noble
woman
of
status
and
wealth
,
but
find
a
greater
cause
as
a
result
of
she
own
imprisonment
.
the
rest
of
the
performance
be
all
broadly
draw
comic
performance
.
nothing
here
be
realistic
,
mind
you
.
''
shanghaus
noon
''
be
first
and
foremost
a
light
,
jovial
film
.
and
the
performance
match
that
style
with
ease
.
the
cinematography
by
dan
mindel
be
gorgeous
.
use
calgary
,
alberta
as
the
prime
location
.
mr
.
mindel
be
able
to
create
a
lush
,
romantic
western
feel
to
the
film
.
nothing
here
really
look
like
nevada
,
but
the
location
be
so
beautifully
shoot
and
stage
,
the
film
can
be
look
upon
as
a
loving
tribute
to
earlier
film
of
the
genre
.
and
as
such
,
the
script
by
alfred
gough
and
mile
millar
play
fast
and
loose
with
history
,
but
with
reverence
to
past
film
.
homage
to
such
film
as
''
high
noon
''
-lrb-
obviously
-rrb-
,
''
red
river
''
and
most
notably
''
butch
cassidy
&
the
sundance
kid
''
all
bring
a
sense
of
nostalgia
to
the
film
.
it
be
a
comforting
experience
.
at
a
time
when
the
western
be
consider
either
old
hat
or
irrelevant
,
here
be
a
film
that
embrace
those
old
attitude
and
-lrb-
dare
i
say
-rrb-
clich
?
s
and
manage
to
make
they
palatable
and
refreshing
.
here
be
a
film
that
be
not
contemptuous
of
the
genre
.
this
be
the
purest
''
horse
opera
''
since
the
day
of
george
o'brian
or
john
wayne
.
director
tom
dey
have
craft
a
loving
tribute
to
hollywood
's
past
.
in
this
,
he
first
film
mr
.
dey
show
both
a
love
of
character
and
of
craftsmanship
that
be
refreshing
to
see
.
nothing
here
really
stand
out
,
or
take
one
's
attention
away
from
the
story
or
action
.
and
that
be
as
it
should
be
,
when
jackie
chan
be
you
star
.
and
what
of
the
action
and
stunt
.
well
,
while
not
up
to
a
level
of
''
drunken
master
2
''
or
any
of
jackie
's
hong
kong
film
,
''
shanghai
noon
''
be
mile
ahead
of
anything
jackie
have
do
in
a
american
film
before
.
he
timing
,
choreography
,
and
creativity
be
still
as
sharp
as
ever
.
jackie
even
get
to
recreate
a
few
scene
from
he
earlier
film
-lrb-
obvious
to
those
of
we
that
have
see
those
film
,
but
refreshingly
fun
for
those
unfamiliar
-rrb-
.
finally
jackie
can
honestly
say
,
that
he
have
make
a
u
.
s
.
,
he
way
and
incorporate
he
style
.
to
sum
up
,
''
shanghai
noon
''
be
a
fun
summer
confection
.
not
too
heavy
and
not
too
light
.
a
fun
and
entertaining
film
that
the
whole
family
can
enjoy
-lrb-
parent
be
advise
there
be
scene
of
smoking
,
drunkenness
and

film
that
can
and
will
be
enjoy
again
and
again
