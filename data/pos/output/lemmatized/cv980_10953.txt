bill
murray
-lrb-
ghostbuster
,
1984
-rrb-
play
grumpy
weatherman
phil
conner
,
who
,
every
year
,
be
send
to
punxsutawney
,
p
.
a
,
to
report
on
groundhog
day
.
the
groundhog
day
ceremony
involve
a
groundhog
be
lift
out
of
a
box
,
and
if
he
dose
not
see
a
shadow
,
it
will
be
a
early
spring
.
phil
really
hate
the
ceremony
,
and
not
even
he
producer
rita
-lrb-
macdowell
-rrb-
can
change
he
mind
.
however
,
fate
have
a
cruel
trick
for
phil
,
and
he
start
re-living
groundhog
day
over
,
and
over
,
and
over
,
until
he
gradually
like
it
,
and
rita
fall
in
love
with
he
.
groundhog
day
be
a
well
write
,
totatly
unoffensive
and
funny
comedy
.
the
screenwriter
,
director
rami
and
danny
rubin
,
have
write
a
funny
,
warm
,
but
never
overly
senitmental
comedy
.
although
the
idea
of
a
day
repeat
over
and
over
may
sound
tedious
,
there
be
enough
good
joke
to
hold
the
audience
attention
throughout
the
whole
film
.
rami
's
direction
also
help
,
and
although
he
dose
not
try
any
flash
director
trick
,
the
film
be
direct
well
enough
,
and
the
joke
be
set
up
well
.
and
the
editing
be
also
good
,
especially
when
it
show
one
part
of
the
day
over
,
and
over
again
,
such
as
when
phil
try
to
have
the
perfect
night
with
rita
.
the
performance
be
also
excellent
.
bill
murray
be
great
fun
,
and
he
transistion
from
cynical
to
happy
be
smooth
,
and
deliver
he
line
in
he
usual
smary
style
.
andie
macdowell
be
good
as
rita
,
although
sometimes
she
be
just
a
little
bit
too
sweet
in
some
part
of
the
film
.
there
be
chemistry
between
the
two
lead
,
thankfully
,
otherwise
the
whole
film
would
probably
fall
part
.
chri
elliot
,
as
the
cameraman
larry
,
be
also
funny
,
although
you
have
to
like
he
goofy
style
,
otherwise
you
be
really
go
to
hate
he
throughout
this
film
,
and
it
will
lower
you
enjoyment
of
the
film
overall
.
the
support
cast
be
not
bad
either
,
with
stephen
tobolowsky
hillarous
as
phil
old
school
mate
ned
ryanson
,
and
even
director
rami
pop
up
as
a
neurologist
.
in
fact
,
there
be
not
one
dud
performance
in
this
film
,
and
even
the
groundhog
get
a
funny
scene
involve
a
car
chase
.
overall
,
there
be
really
nothing
wrong
with
groundhog
day
at
all
.
it
almost
seem
perfect
.
however
,
the
film
can
get
a
bit
soppy
sometimes
,
and
some
people
may
get
irritated
by
the
day
repeat
over
,
and
over
,
and
over
,
and
over
.
also
,
there
be
not
much
of
a
music
score
,
and
the
music
there
be
be
pretty
bad
.
but
these
criticism
hardly
affect
the
audience
enjoyment
at
all
.
overall
,
then
,
groundhog
day
be
a
funny
,
smart
,
and
also
have
some
room
in
there
for
some
heart
.
a
excellent
comedy
.
overall
rating
=
