showgirl
be
the
second
major
outing
for
the
production
team
of
pual
verhoeven
,
director
,
and
joe
eszterha
,
writer
.
they
last
effort
,
basic
instinct
,
play
like
the
most
sumptuous
of
classic
hitchcock
,
with
a
dash
of
raw
sex
and
sensuality
that
make
it
come
across
with
a
hit
like
curry-spiced
tabasco
sauce
;
a
dish
not
to
everyone
's
taste
,
but
certainly
a
well-crafted
movie
.
possibly
that
movie
's
greatest
strength
be
that
the
most
important
event
happen
offstage
,
prior
to
the
movie
,
during
the
movie
,
and
after
the
movie
...
and
that
,
after
bring
all
the
plotline
together
neatly
,
it
leave
the
viewer
with
full
knowledge
of
what
\*
would
\*
happen
in
the
character
'
future
,
so
there
be
no
need
to
film
it
.
there
be
actually
about
four
hour
'
worth
of
screen
story
there
,
but
eszterha
find
way
to
get
it
all
on-screen
in
two
,
by
lead
he
audience
into
analyze
what
be
really
go
on
;
and
by
still
hold
they
interest
with
clever
misdirection
and
false
trail
.
the
major
element
that
make
basic
instinct
work
so
well
be
present
in
showgirl
.
we
have
attractive
,
sympathetic
,
but
still
highly
repellent
character
;
we
have
show
for
the
eye
and
the
ear
,
plotline
that
play
on
several
level
,
we
have
beautifully
delineate
character
who
be
draw
from
life
and
very
believable
,
and
we
have
a
story
of
a
innocent
-lrb-
who
may
not
be
so
innocent
-rrb-
who
be
try
to
play
straight
,
try
to
improve
she
station
in
life
,
who
slip
into
behave
the
way
those
around
she
do
...
but
recover
with
a
flourish
,
and
quit
a
winner
.
in
this
sense
,
the
movie
be
a
bit
of
a
departure
for
verhoeven
,
who
be
not
know
for
treat
he
character
well
;
but
nomus
,
the
part
play
by
elizabeth
berkley
,
definitely
opt
out
of
the
game
in
a
positive
way
,
and
we
be
leave
feel
good
about
she
future
.
this
be
not
one
of
the
great
movie
,
but
it
be
far
better
than
we
would
be
lead
to
expect
by
all
the
negative
pre-release
publicity
.
verhoeven
get
he
first
oscar
nomination
in
1971
,
and
in
the
last
quarter-century
have
push
farther
and
farther
,
experiment
with
the
socially-acceptable
limit
to
movie-making
.
he
most
recent
three
movie
,
robocop
,
total
recall
,
and
basic
instinct
,
have
be
a
progression
of
back-door
access
to
american
culture
,
move
from
the
fantastic
through
the
merely
psychotic
to
the
underlie
basic
drive
;
and
now
he
be
explore
the
sleeze
.
this
movie
may
be
the
first
movie
ever
make
for
which
the
director
's
contract
contain
a
specific
provision
that
he
would
not
have
to
deliver
a
r
rate
movie
.
-lrb-
verhoeven
have
to
cut
several
part
of
basic
instinct
to
get
a
r
rating
,
although
he
original
version
be
available
on
video
.
-rrb-
many
reviewer
have
take
the
politically-correct
stance
that
any
movie
which
use
naked
lady
as
scenery
be
a
bad
thing
;
but
they
miss
the
fact
that
this
movie
be
not
about
naked
lady
,
it
be
about
people
in
a
environment
where
naked
lady
be
common
,
and
why
such
a
environment
should
exist
.
it
be
about
the
scum
who
use
other
people
as
power-trip
toy
,
and
the
need
to
escape
they
power
.
it
be
about
a
world
where
sex
be
nothing
and
normal
human
value
do
not
pertain
;
and
the
lack
of
sexual
excitement
and
passionate
heat
in
even
the
most
blatant
scene
be
something
of
a
accomplishment
.
a
nc-17
movie
which
be
not
sexually
exciting
say
a
great
deal
about
the
phoniness
and
emptiness
of
a
social
stratum
where
sex
have
be
rob
of
any
kind
of
beauty
,
power
,
or
value
.
the
one
scene
in
the
movie
that
\*
could
\*
have
be
a
good
sex
scene
,
berkley
and
maclachlan
in
a
swimming
pool
,
be
not
exciting
,
because
by
then
we
already
know
he
character
be
a
callous
manipulator
.
if
anything
,
it
be
a
rape
scene
with
a
victim
who
be
be
dupe
into
cooperation
.
you
do
not
make
a
movie
about
the
history
of
black
people
in
america
without
use
a
few
black
actor
;
you
do
not
make
a
movie
about
world
war
ii
without
a
few
gun
go
off
and
a
few
people
get
kill
;
and
you
do
not
make
a
movie
about
las
vegas
showgirl
without
show
a
few
la
vega
showgirl
...
and
in
a
awful
lot
of
vega
show
,
a
awful
lot
of
lady
wear
very
little
clothing
.
this
be
a
legitimate
portrayal
of
a
rather
seamy
side
of
the
entertainment
industry
,
in
a
town
where
sex
be
simply
a
negotiable
commodity
.
showgirl
de-glamorize
the
las
vegas
show
and
sex
industry
with
great
effectiveness
.
nomus
be
play
,
in
a
very
good
performance
,
by
elizabeth
berkley
,
who
give
we
a
solid
picture
of
a
woman
with
limited
talent
who
be
at
the
end
of
she
rope
,
desperate
to
live
a
life
better
than
the
one
she
be
know
.
she
have
nothing
to
market
except
she
body
and
she
limited
dancing
ability
,
and
be
try
desperately
not
to
to
be
a
hooker
,
try
to
be
something
better
than
she
seem
destine
to
be
.
when
nomi
realize
she
be
go
too
far
for
too
little
,
she
catch
herself
just
in
time
to
save
the
most
essential
part
of
who
she
want
to
be
.
gina
rivera
play
molly
,
a
dressmaker
and
costumer
who
befriend
nomus
,
provide
she
with
what
may
be
the
one
solid
,
positive
relationship
in
nomus
's
entire
life
.
molly
be
the
one
who
make
the
difference
,
and
provide
the
role
model
and
framework
nomus
need
to
verify
the
value
system
she
'll
be
use
for
the
rest
of
she
life
,
and
nomus
's
feeling
for
molly
be
the
spur
that
force
nomus
's
decision
.
gina
gershon
play
cristal
,
a
aging
,
but
still
very
attractive
star
dancer
,
a
reflexively
competitive
manipulator
who
be
become
a
villainess
by
internalize
the
ethos
of
the
crook
and
scum
around
she
.
gershon
play
cristal
as
a
cross
between
ava
gardner
and
raquel
welch
;
a
fading
talent
make
bitter
by
self-awareness
.
she
character
be
very
well
draw
and
perform
;
in
a
major
scene
in
a
hospital
room
,
she
acknowledge
what
she
be
,
and
,
in
essence
,
pass
the
torch
to
nomus
.
the
relationship
between
the
two
of
they
be
the
most
honest
one
in
the
movie
,
and
provide
part
of
the
impetus
nomus
need
to
follow
a
different
path
.
it
be
no
accident
that
the
three
important
part
in
this
movie
be
woman
of
different
stripe
;
molly
be
a
honest
,
hard-working
person
who
mean
well
,
and
nearly
die
because
she
confuse
the
glitter
and
the
image
with
reality
.
cristal
be
a
talented
dancer
who
be
compromise
she
ideal
and
sell
herself
to
be
a
co-operating
part
of
the
system
,
exchange
self-respect
for
the
species
of
stardom
that
can
be
have
in
las
vegas
.
nomus
believe
she
can
make
it
without
sell
herself
,
succumb
to
a
degree
,
and
then
realize
she
can
make
it
without
sell
herself
,
and
do
not
need
las
vegas
or
its
brand
of
''
stardom
.
''
the
male
part
in
this
movie
be
simply
prop
;
they
exist
only
to
demonstrate
and
explicate
the
cultural
milieu
against
which
showgirl
exist
.
kyle
maclachlan
,
whose
single
best
previous
work
be
as
a
inhumanly
emotionless
cop
in
the
hide
,
give
we
a
nicely
reptilian
bit
of
pond
scum
on
two
leg
,
camouflage
as
a
nice
guy
.
glenn
plummer
play
a
dancer
who
be
work
as
a
bellboy
,
and
provide
a
bit
of
alternate
perspective
.
plummer
's
character
be
the
only
one
in
the
movie
who
be
maintain
a
interest
in
dance
as
a
perform
art
,
but
even
he
be
succumb
to
the
cult
of
manipulation
.
plummer
's
character
be
the
closest
thing
to
a
sympathetic
male
character
in
the
whole
movie
.
some
of
jost
vacano
's
cinematography
be
fantastic
,
and
one
particular
delineation
of
nomus
's
character
alteration
,
a
no-dialog
scene
use
nothing
but
color
change
in
the
lighting
,
be
utterly
terrifying
.
this
movie
be
rate
nc-17
due
to
language
,
sexual
situation
,
full
frontal
nudity
,
violence
,
and
probably
the
costuming
as
well
.
i
do
not
see
a
way
this
particular
story
could
have
be
tell
well
without
it
,
and
i
regard
it
as
a
legitimate
exercise
in
movie-making
.
but
do
not
go
see
it
if
you
be
not
in
a
tough
mood
;
the
only
person
it
be
possible
to
like
in
this
movie
end
up
in
a
i
.
c
.
u
.
on
life
support
,
and
there
be
probably
not
one
character
in
this
movie
you
would
enjoy
meeting
in
person
.
