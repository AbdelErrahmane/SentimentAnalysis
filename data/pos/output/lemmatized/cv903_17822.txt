robert
altman
's
cookie
's
fortune
be
that
rare
movie
that
do
not
depend
on
sentimentality
to
be
uplifting
and
to
make
its
viewer
feel
good
.
it
be
a
sunny
,
delightful
,
dreamy
comedy
,
fill
with
lovely
performance
,
skillful
direction
and
top
off
with
a
understate
,
clever
,
extraordinary
script
.
as
this
be
a
ensemble
piece
,
it
be
force
to
start
of
slowly
as
it
introduce
we
to
its
character
,
all
of
they
reside
in
a
southern
town
call
holly
spring
.
first
we
meet
willie
-lrb-
charle
s
.
dutton
-rrb-
,
a
honest
man
with
a
slight
drinking
habit
.
we
then
see
that
willie
take
care
of
a
elderly
lady
nickname
cookie
,
who
be
slowly
lose
she
grip
on
sanity
and
be
be
fill
with
loneliness
,
despair
,
and
want
of
she
dead
husband
.
we
cut
to
camille
-lrb-
glenn
close
-rrb-
who
be
obsessively
direct
a
play
with
she
sister
cora
-lrb-
julianne
moore
-rrb-
.
then
we
briefly
get
acquaint
with
emma
-lrb-
liv
tyler
-rrb-
,
a
apparent
relative
of
cookie
,
who
be
a
down-but-not-out
teen
outcast
,
still
full
of
love
and
hope
even
though
she
have
no
real
place
to
live
.
we
also
fleetingly
see
emma
's
lover
jason
-lrb-
chri
o'donnell
-rrb-
,
a
ambitious
but
far
too
excitable
young
cop
.
we
be
now
about
one
quarter
through
the
two
hour
picture
,
and
robert
altman
decide
that
it
be
time
to
set
the
plot
in
motion
.
we
see
the
ecstatic
cookie
stare
hopefully
at
a
picture
of
she
husband
.
she
exclaim
''
here
i
come
!
''
and
then
put
a
pillow
to
she
face
and
shoot
herself
.
soon
after
,
she
niece
camille
stop
by
to
get
a
fruit
salad
bowl
,
come
upstairs
,
find
cookie
dead
and
flip
out
.
convinced
that
suicide
be
a
disgrace
and
that
she
will
have
none
of
that
in
she
family
,
she
eat
the
suicide
note
and
convince
she
slightly
slow
-lrb-
yet
sweet
-rrb-
sister
that
it
be
a
murder
.
she
make
sure
that
she
stage
it
like
a
murder
as
well
;
scatter
jewelry
all
over
the
floor
,
break
a
few
cabinet
,
window
and
door
,
and
then
throw
the
gun
out
in
the
back
yard
.
the
only
reasonable
suspect
be
willie
,
who
immediately
get
take
into
custody
,
and
put
in
a
jail
cell
-lrb-
they
all
know
he
do
not
do
it
,
so
the
cell
stay
open
and
he
play
scrabble
with
the
sheriff
and
the
faithful
emma
-rrb-
.
meanwhile
,
the
unperturbed
camille
continue
she
none-too-subtle
manipulation
try
to
further
cover
up
for
the
murder
while
at
the
same
time
make
she
easter
play
a
success
.
so
begin
cookie
's
fortune
,
a
film
aptly
describe
by
critic
scott
renshaw
as
''
a
southern
spin
on
fargo
,
''
except
that
this
one
be
far
funnier
and
much
more
enjoyable
than
the
coen
brother
'
darker
,
somewhat
disturbing
and
slightly
overrated
escapade
.
robert
altman
's
slight
picture
be
in
some
way
reminiscent
of
something
like
midnight
in
the
garden
of
good
and
evil
as
well
,
in
that
both
film
focus
-lrb-
on
and
off
-rrb-
on
the
eccentricity
of
the
resident
in
a
southern
we
town
.
indeed
,
most
of
the
character
in
cookie
's
fortune
be
load
of
fun
to
observe
,
and
a
portion
of
they
be
fascinating
and
surprisingly
multus
-
dimensional
.
glenn
close
turn
in
a
insubstantial
-lrb-
in
term
of
she
career
-rrb-
but
magnificent
performance
as
the
conniving
camille
and
be
also
the
source
of
a
good
portion
of
the
many
laugh
that
we
enjoy
in
this
movie
,
and
she
be
perfectly
cast
as
the
prolific
''
aunt
alexandrium
''
character
,
endlessly
obsess
with
family
dignity
.
the
equally
essential
role
of
willie
be
handle
with
a
intangible
grace
by
veteran
thespian
charle
s
.
dutton
-lrb-
mimic
,
a
time
to
kill
-rrb-
there
be
nothing
like
a
movie
which
leave
you
feel
all
warm
and
fuzzy
inside
hour
,
even
day
after
the
film
end
.
cookie
's
fortune
be
such
a
movie
.
i
love
the
light
,
kindhearted
approach
altman
-lrb-
whose
last
project
be
the
dark
,
intense
drama
the
gingerbread
man
-rrb-
take
towards
the
tricky
subject
matter
.
i
enjoy
the
talented
ensemble
cast
.
i
even
like
the
trite
''
in
the
south
everybody
be
relate
to
everybody
''
cliche
that
be
inevitably
employ
by
the
time
this
movie
draw
to
a
close
.
i
be
not
sure
why
cookie
's
fortune
have
such
a
all-around
pleasing
effect
on
I
.
perhaps
it
be
that
good
ol'
southern
charm
.
