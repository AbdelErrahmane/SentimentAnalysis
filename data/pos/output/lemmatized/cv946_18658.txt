review

few
movie
evoke
nostalgia
,
enthusiasm
,
and
affection
like
george
luca
'
1977
classic
,
star
war
.
the
original
blockbuster
film
and
its
two
sequel
not
only
evoke
wonder
and
passion
in
a
generation
of
filmgoer
,
but
have
deeply
entrenched
itself
in
american
pop
culture
.
arguably
,
more
american
today
can
explain
what
''
the
force
''
or
a
''
jedus
''
be
than
a
budget
deficit
or
a
serb
.
so
22
year
after
the
release
of
the
original
,
and
16
year
since
the
third
film
,
the
return
of
the
jedus
,
how
can
any
new
star
war
film
withstand
the
weight
of
incomparable
expectation
and
anticipation
?
can
a
new
storyline
and
a
new
cast
of
character
possibly
compete
with
the
legend
of
the
first
trilogy
-
luke
,
han
solo
,
and
darth
vader
-
all
cultural
icon
?
against
this
challenge
,
the
fourth
star
war
film
,
episode
one
:
the
phantom
menace
hit
the
screen
last
week
.
and
despite
some
early
critical
review
in
the
major
media
,
the
film
be
neither
a
flop
nor
a
disappointment
.
while
the
phantom
menace
be
certainly
not
the
finest
film
in
the
series
,
it
be
nonetheless
engaging
,
exciting
,
and
visually
breathtaking
.
it
be
a
worthy
sequel
-
er
,
prequel
-
to
the
original

the

they
soon
also
have
to
deal
with
the
deadly
and
relentless
darth
maul
.
if
the
plot
sound
a
bit
complicated
,
it
be
.
the
phantom
menace
not
only
introduce
a
earlier
generation
of
character
and
a
immediate
crisis
,
but
set
up
the
foundation
for
the
event
that
will
eventually
lead
to
the
fall
of
the
republic
,
the
demise
of
the
jedus
knight
,
anakin
's
turn
to
evil
,
and
the
rise
of
the
dark
empire
of
original
trilogy
.
but
the
complexity
be
not
overwhelming
.
the
story
move
quickly
,
with
the
only
drawback
be
that
many
question
,
predictably
,
remain
unanswered
at
the
end
of
the
film
,
set
the
stage
for
the
next
episode
.
one
of
the
reason
the
film
's
story
seem
hazy
be
not
that
it
be
too
confusing
,
but
too
unfocused
.
it
be
unclear
whose
story
phantom
menace
be
.
in
the
original
trilogy
,
the
movie
be
clearly
luke
's
story
,
with
the
story
center
around
he
growth
from
farmboy
to
rebel
hero
to
jedus
knight
.
but
it
be
unclear
whether
this
new
film
be
anakin
's
story
or
obi-wan
's
.
if
this
trilogy
be
center
on
anakin
,
it
be
a
shaky
foundation
.
lloyd
,
like
many
child
actor
,
lack
the
subtle
act
skill
of
adult
performer
,
and
as
a
result
,
he
character
seem
shallow
and
unimpressive
.
on
screen
,
we
see
nothing
that
suggest
a
dark
side
lurk
underneath
he
little-boy
face
,
or
for
that
matter
,
any
presence
that
would
make
he
seem
so
special
that
qui-gon
be
willing
to
believe
he
be
''
the
one
.
''
the
rest
of
the
cast
do
fine
,
though
they
often
work
with
some
iffy
dialogue
by
luca
.
neeson
be
perfect
as
a
aging
jedus
knight
.
mcgregor
be
well-cast
as
obi-wan
and
convey
a
balance
of
youthful
energy
and
calm
sensibility
.
portman
fit
the
role
of
a
young
queen
well
,
but
she
line
be
often
very
formal
,
give
she
little
room
to
give
she
character
much
personality
.
the
biggest
problem
with
the
phantom
menace
be
not
the
plot
or
the
character
,
but
the
interaction
between
they
.
individually
,
the
character
in
this
new
film
be
no
less
developed
than
those
in
the
original
star
war
,
and
the
storyline
be
not
more
confusing
than
previous
film
in
the
series
.
but
unlike
the
previous
trilogy
,
luca
do
not
do
as
good
of
a
job
play
the
character
off
one
another
.
in
star
war
,
there
be
immediate
contrast
and
memorable
exchange
between
luke
and
han
,
han
and
obi-wan
,
and
leium
and
luke
.
the
ensemble
play
off
each
other
and
immediately
show
they
distinct
attitude
and
personality
.
in
the
sequence
in
where
luke
,
han
,
and
chewbacca
attempt
to
rescue
leium
from
she
cell
on
the
death
star
,
the
audience
learn
a
lot
about
all
four
character
in
the
way
they
react
to
the
immediate
problem
and
each
other
.
there
be
no
comparable
sequence
in
the
phantom
menace
to
flesh
out
the
character
and
they
relationship
with
each
other
.
individually
,
they
be
interesting
character
with
clear
motivation
and
interest
,
but
luca
develop
little
chemistry
or
tension
between
the
they
.
this
be
perhaps
the
most
glaring
weakness
of
this
film
,
and
be
probably
the
reason
it
have
disappoint
many
reviewer
.
but
despite
the
need
for
a
richer
dialogue
and
stronger
character
interaction
,
the
film
be
still
very
engaging
.
many
of
the
wonderful
element
of
luca
'
previous
film
make
the
phantom
menace
both
memorable
and
entertaining
.
first
,
of
course
,
be
the
remarkably
rich
and
imaginative
universe
luca
create
.
the
character
visit
magical
underwater
city
,
evade
dinosaur-sized
sea
monster
,
fight
battle
droid
and
menacing
''
destroyer
''
on
venetian-looking
planet
of
naboo
,
watch
a
spectacular
event
,
part
roman-chariot
race
,
part
nascar
circuit
,
on
the
arid
desert
planet
of
tatooine
,
then
head
to
corsucant
,
the
gothic
urban
capital
of
the
republic
and
home
to
the
galactic
senate
and
the
jedus
council
.
each
location
be
elaborate
and
complex
.
luca
never
settle
for
vague
idea
about
the
look
of
he
setting
,
he
create
rich
,
spectacular
landscape
,
palace
,
and
skyline
.
most
of
the
new
special
effect
in
he
re-released
special
edition
trilogy
in
1997
be
change
that
allow
he
to
give
the
earlier
movie
the
look
and
feel
that
just
be
not
possible
when
the
film
be
make
.
more
than
ever
,
in
this
new
film
,
luca
'
universe
be
fill
with
a
menagerie
of
creature
,
robot
with
personality
,
and
a
support
cast
of
alien
who
interact
with
the
main
character
.
the
best
such
character
be
watto
,
a
greedy
tatooine
junk
dealer
who
own
anakin
and
he
mother
as
slave
.
watto
have
a
scratchy
italian
voice
and
a
short
,
paunchy
body
with
oddly
mismatched
wing
that
flutter
like
a
hummingbird
as
he
float
around
the
room
.
of
all
the
computer-generated
character
in
the
film
,
watto
be
the
best
do
and
most
enjoyable
.
speaking
of
computer-generated
character
,
no
review
of
the
phantom
menace
be
complete
without
mention
the
most
controversial
figure
in
the
film
:
jar
jar
bink
.
with
more
than
80
minute
of
screen
time
,
jar
jar
be
the
realization
of
george
luca
'
dream
to
include
a
fully
computer-generated
character
into
the
cast
of
the
new
trilogy
.
jar
jar
,
a
clumsy
amphibian
and
member
of
the
gungan
race
,
literally
stumble
he
way
into
the
path
of
the
jedus
knight
early
in
the
film
and
become
quus
jon
's
accidental
sidekick
.
jar
jar
usually
perform
a
comic-relief
role
in
the
film
,
lighten
scene
with
he
mishap
and
inability
to
stay
out
of
trouble
.
the
animation
of
jar
jar
be
nearly
seamless
,
and
he
interact
with
the
character
throughout
the
film
as
if
he
be
really
on
the
set
with
the
actor
.
however
,
despite
the
technological
magic
that
make
he
character
possible
,
jar
jar
be
not
completely
convincing
.
he
still
move
and
sound
too
much
like
a
cartoon
to
blend
into
a
scene
.
throughout
the
movie
,
jar
jar
never
transcend
a
''
roger
rabbit
''
-
like
presence
.
you
accept
that
he
be
there
,
but
you
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
be
a
animated
character
.
initially
,
i
find
jar
jar
annoying
,
but
grow
to
enjoy
the
humor
he
add
to
the
film
.
on
my
second
viewing
of
the
film
,
jar
jar
be
a
lot
of
fun
and
i
do
not
mind
he
at
all
.
a
second
reason
this
film
continue
the
fine
tradition
of
star
war
movie
be
that
the
film
be
replete
with
humor
and
small
detail
that
flesh
out
the
world
luca
create
.
despite
all
the
film
's
struggle
between
good
and
evil
,
and
the
sober
musing
about
one
's
destiny
and
''
the
force
,
''
like
all
star
war
film
,
the
phantom
menace
never
take
itself
too
seriously
.
fortunately
,
luca
have
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
film
be
entertainment
,
not
high
art
.
from
the
bumble
jar
jar
,
to
a
one-man
,
two-headed
announcer
team
call
the
action
at
the
film
's
thrilling
pod-race
sequence
,
to
a
cameo
appearance
by
e
.
t
.
in
the
film
,
the
phantom
menace
be
simply
a
lot
of
fun
,
with
lot
of
half-hidden
joke
and
humor
that
can
easily
be
miss
.
and
finally
,
the
phantom
menace
work
because
,
as
in
all
he
film
,
there
be
no
shortage
of
speed
and
action
.
from
begin
to
end
,
there
be
light-saber
battle
,
hair-raising
chase
,
and
thrilling
duel
between
good
and
evil
.
the
pod-race
sequence
on
tatooine
be
one
of
the
most
entertaining
and
exciting
scene
in
any
star
war
film
,
and
the
final
showdown
between
obi-wan
,
qui-gon
,
and
darth
maul
be
arguably
the
best
choreograph
,
most
thrilling
fight
sequence
luca
have
film
.
the
phantom
menace
will
not
win
any
major
oscar
.
it
probably
will
not
beat
titanic
's
box
office
record
.
and
it
be
not
even
the
best
star
war
film
-lrb-
i
would
put
it
third
,
after
the
original
and
the
empire
strike
back
-rrb-
.
but
it
be
a
exciting
and
entertaining
film
,
far
better
than
you
typical
summer
blockbuster
.
the
film
can
not
live
up
to
it
be
hype
-
no
film
,
not
even
the
original
star
war
,
could
have
do
that
.
but
it
be
still
worth
see
...
probably
more
than
once
.
