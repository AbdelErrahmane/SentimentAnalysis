the
start
of
this
movie
remind
I
of
part
from
the
movie
stargate
.
people
be
look
around
in
a
egyptian
temple
read
about
some
dangerous
thing
that
be
go
to
destroy
earth
in
the
future
.
after
a
sort
of
confusing
bit
involve
fake-looking
cyborg
thing
,
the
movie
jump
into
the
future
and
the
movie
improve
by
leap
and
bound
.
the
basic
idea
behind
the
movie
be
that
every
once
in
a
while
-lrb-
make
that
every
1000
year
or
so
-rrb-
a
evil
force
come
to
destroy
earth
.
the
thing
need
to
defend
against
this
menace
be
the
four
element
of
nature
plus
the
fifth
element
.
the
plot
in
this
movie
really
be
not
that
important
to
the
thing
though
.
this
movie
have
very
good
special
effect
,
for
the
most
part
.
the
techno-ish
music
in
the
background
fit
the
mood
very
well
.
bruce
willi
be
a
illegal
taxi-cab
driver
in
a
futuristic
new
york
city
.
one
day
a
lady
drape
with
a
few
bandage
drop
down
into
he
trunk
.
this
movie
be
about
what
happen
.
the
plot
twist
be
interesting
and
the
movie
never
fail
to
present
the
viewer
with
a
variety
of
different
location
.
also
there
be
a
fair
bit
of
action
in
the
film
,
particularly
towards
the
end
.
some
character
be
just
plain
strange
include
a
highly-energetic
deejay
in
drag
.
bruce
willi
do
he
normal
job
of
blow
thing
away
like
he
always
do
.
the
movie
be
definitely
watchable
and
rarely
slow
down
.
it
be
one
of
those
sci-fi
film
where
you
'll
be
say
''
cool
''
follow
by
a
''
what
the
hell
?
!
?
!
''
.
i
give
the
fifth
element
.
