this
be
director
tim
burton
's
finest
film
to
date
.
many
will
compare
this
tale
of
martian
who
invade
earth
to
independence
day
,
but
even
though
the
story
be
similar
,
they
really
be
two
distinctly
different
film
.
however
as
a
whole
,
mar
attack
be
much
more
entertaining
than
id4
,
and
i
love
id4
.
you
really
have
to
be
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
to
enjoy
this
film
.
it
be
completely
wacked-out
and
unlike
anything
you
have
ever
see
.
once
the
silly
tone
of
the
film
be
set
,
it
be
easy
to
just
sit
back
and
throw
logic
out
the
window
because
logic
and
comedy
just
do
not
mix
.
the
plot
be
simple
:
martian
invade
the
earth
.
but
it
be
different
than
any
other
invasion
film
.
usually
it
be
the
evil
alien
versus
the
heroic
human
.
this
time
however
,
it
be
the
goofy
alien
versus
the
equally
goofy
human
.
the
martian
,
who
be
all
computer
generate
,
be
just
about
the
funniest
thing
i
have
see
in
a
long
time
.
they
look
funny
,
they
move
funny
,
and
they
''
language
''
be
hilarious
.
and
about
the
special
effect
.
the
effect
in
mar
attack
!
be
just
about
the
most
flawless
one
i
have
see
to
date
.
the
computer
animation
of
the
martian
combine
with
the
goofy
personality
they
be
give
make
they
seem
100
%
real
.
there
be
just
a
couple
of
scene
that
do
not
work
,
mainly
those
involve
sarah
jessica
parker
and
pierce
brosnan
on
board
a
alien
ship
.
also
,
glenn
close
overact
tremendously
in
she
-lrb-
thankfully
-rrb-
very
limited
screen
time
,
so
much
so
that
i
actually
applaud
silently
when
she
character
meet
she
demise
.
but
there
be
many
big
laugh
in
the
film
,
as
i
say
,
if
you
be
in
the
right
mood
.
could
it
have
be
funnier
?
certainly
.
be
it
funny
enough
?
yes
.
be
i
entertain
?
absolutely
.
on
a
personal
note
,
i
would
like
to
thank
whomever
cast
rod
steiger
-lrb-
my
favorite
actor
-rrb-
in
the
film
as
war-crazy
general
decker
.
finally
,
after
many
very
small
part
in
direct
to
video
garbage
and
minor
tv
role
,
steiger
be
back
on
the
big
screen
in
a
real
movie
that
many
people
will
see
.
while
he
be
not
give
the
type
of
role
that
you
can
give
a
real
''
performance
''
in
,
he
do
the
job
well
and
have
some
good
line
of
dialogue
.
the
preview
audience
i
see
the
film
with
really
seem
to
enjoy
he
.
