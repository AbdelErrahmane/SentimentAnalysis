as
well
be
one
of
the
best
movie
ever
.
period
.
then
again
there
be
so
many
good
movie
,
that
one
can
not
pick
a
all
time
favorite
.
john
cusack
play
a
puppeteer
craig
schwartz
a
man
out
of
a
job
,
in
search
of
a
job
.
he
wife
lotte
schwartz
who
be
play
by
a
completely
un-noticeable
cameron
diaz
who
look
like
something
off
the
street
be
a
animal
lover
and
have
about
every
kind
of
animal
you
could
think
of
.
craig
find
a
job
as
a
file
at
the
7
?
floor
of
a
business
building
...
you
have
to
pry
open
the
elevator
door
open
before
it
reach
floor
eight
,
the
7
?
floor
be
just
a
floor
between
7
and
8
.
he
be
hire
by
he
105
year
old
boss
-lrb-
orsen
bean
-rrb-
to
be
a
filer
.
in
he
office
,
he
discover
a
little
door
,
to
which
be
board
up
and
hide
.
to
he
curiosity
he
open
it
and
start
to
crawl
toward
it
,
he
then
get
suck
to
the
end
and
end
up
in
john
malkovich
's
mind
.
fifteen
minute
later
he
be
shoot
out
onto
the
side
of
the
new
jersey
turnpike
.
he
return
to
tell
he
co-worker
maxine
-lrb-
catherine
keener
-rrb-
that
he
have
find
a
portal
that
will
lead
he
into
john
malkovich
's
mind
,
she
do
not
believe
he
but
after
she
see
it
it
change
she
mind
.
lotte
also
find
out
about
the
portal
and
discover
that
be
someone
else
be
good
after
all
.
john
malkovich
of
course
have
no
idea
what
be
go
on
,
and
by
the
end
of
this
bizarre
film
there
be
so
many
twist
and
turn
,
that
we
do
not
know
what
really
happen
.
john
cusack
be
outstanding
and
utterly
believeable
in
a
role
only
he
himself
could
play
.
he
fit
the
role
perfectly
and
to
I
be
brilliantly
cast
.
cameron
diaz
be
outstanding
and
utterly
one
of
the
world
's
most
prettiest
woman
,
be
make
up
here
unnoticeable
and
very
unattractive
.
she
however
give
a
very
comic
performance
and
this
could
easily
be
she
best
role
to
date
.
catherine
keener
be
very
funny
and
sexy
as
maxine
and
of
course
the
best
thing
of
the
movie
be
the
magic
himself
john
malkovich
who
be
very
brilliant
and
this
movie
play
big
time
homage
?
to
the
master
himself
.
the
whole
group
combine
give
we
a
wonderfully
funny
movie
that
be
also
smart
and
clever
.
spike
jonze
-lrb-
three
king
-rrb-
make
he
fabulous
directing
debut
,
and
do
a
fantastic
job
of
direct
this
new
classic
film
.
he
let
the
viewer
go
on
the
trip
as
well
as
let
the
viewer
know
they
be
watch
a
movie
.
by
the
time
the
end
roll
around
my
head
be
spin
from
disbelief
of
how
good
this
film
be
.
the
screenplay
write
by
charlie
kaufman
be
hilarious
and
often
thought-provoking
.
the
film
also
have
a
soft
side
to
it
and
even
though
the
end
be
very
surprising
it
be
also
a
little
sad
and
heart-warming
.
the
whole
movie
be
fantastic
and
have
I
roll
in
the
isle
.
from
cameron
diaz
's
appearence
to
john
malkovich
's
exploration
i
laugh
very
hard
,
and
it
may
as
well
be
as
funny
as
as
good
as
it
get
-lrb-
the
funniest
!
-rrb-
.
there
be
not
a
slow
point
in
the
movie
,
or
a
overused
idea
.
there
be
no
cliche
except
for
the
fact
that
this
be
the
most
original
,
inventie
,
witty
,
and
smart
movie
i
have
see
in
a
long
time
.
i
find
myself
amaze
by
everything
:
the
direction
,
act
,
write
and
the
whole
idea
of
the
movie
.
by
the
end
i
have
to
wonder
why
hollywood
do
not
want
to
make
movie
like
this
anymore
.
or
why
they
do
not
.
all
filmmaker
watch
this
movie
and
get
some
idea
of
movie
to
come
out
.
this
be
a
surprise
hit
as
be
american
beauty
.
`
be
john
malkovich
'
be
in
the
top
5
movie
of
the
year
,
and
in
the
top
10
best
film
ever
make
.
it
have
something
that
no
other
movie
play
now
have
.
in
fact
it
may
as
well
be
the
best
movie
out
right
now
.
i
highly
recommend
`
be
john
malkovich
'
and
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
disappoint
.
