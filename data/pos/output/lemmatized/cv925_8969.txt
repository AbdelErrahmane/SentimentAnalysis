contact
be
a
film
that
try
to
do
several
different
thing
.
it
be
intend
to
present
a
realistic
picture
of
what
alien
contact
might
be
like
,
to
restore
a
sense
of
wonder
and
mystery
to
the
issue
of
extraterrestrial
life
,
to
raise
question
about
science
and
faith
and
how
they
would
be
relevant
in
such
a
situation
,
and
to
tell
a
personal
story
of
a
romance
between
the
astronomer
dr
.
ellie
arroway
-lrb-
jodie
foster
-rrb-
and
the
religious
spokesman
palmer
joss
-lrb-
matthew
mcconaughey
-rrb-
.
the
film
succeed
wonderfully
at
its
first
two
goal
.
the
portrayal
of
the
communication
from
a
alien
world
be
much
more
reasonable
-lrb-
albeit
less
immediately
engage
-rrb-
than
,
say
,
the
cold-blooded
destructiveness
of
the
invader
in
independence
day
or
even
the
complex
process
of
abduction
and
genetic
hybridization
that
form
the
ongoing
plot
line
of
tv
's
the
x-files
.
the
alien
in
contact
seem
to
be
like
us-they
be
more
curious
than
anything
else
.
they
know
we
exist
,
they
want
we
to
know
that
they
exist
,
and
they
would
like
to
make
the
next
step
and
communicate
in
person
.
the
film
wisely
refrain
from
show
we
the
alien
directly
,
and
between
the
character
'
ongoing
speculation
about
the
extraterrestrial
and
the
outstanding
visual
in
the
climactic
yet
enigmatic
scene
when
arroway
arrive
on
the
alien
world
,
that
sense
of
wonder
and
mystery
come
through
with
a
force
rarely
see
since
stanley
kubrick
's
2001
:
a
space
odyssey
.
most
of
the
film
,
however
,
take
place
on
earth
,
where
there
be
a
extended
public
debate
on
how
to
respond
to
these
alien
.
scientist
be
enthusiastic
,
ultraconservative
religious
leader
be
wary
,
and
government
official
be
catch
somewhere
in
between
.
the
debate
be
fuel
largely
by
dr
.
arroway
's
atheism
;
she
seem
the
obvious
choice
to
pilot
the
spacecraft
for
which
the
alien
have
provide
blueprint
,
but
many
be
wary
of
send
a
atheist
as
humankind
's
representative
to
another
species
.
the
film
be
partly
successful
in
raise
and
explore
these
question
,
especially
when
it
reach
a
conclusion
that
suggest
that
the
two
approach
-
science
and
faith
-
could
be
view
as
complementary
rather
than
diametrically
oppose
.
still
,
the
film
fall
a
little
short
in
its
representation
of
this
conflict
as
it
exist
in
american
society
.
the
two
''
side
''
be
represent
primarily
by
arroway
and
by
far-right
fundamentalist
,
but
in
reality
probably
80
%
of
american
be
neither
atheist
nor
far-right
fundamentalist
.
palmer
joss
occupy
something
of
a
middle
ground
,
but
he
ultimately
become
distract
by
personal
motive
and
come
across
as
a
less-than-ideal
spokesman
for
any
ideology
.
then
again
,
the
film
do
concentrate
mostly
on
public
debate
,
which
do
,
after
all
,
tend
to
be
dominate
by
extremist
,
rather
than
on
dinner-table
or
college-dormitory
discussion
.
contact
be
accurate
in
its
portrayal
of
these
issue
,
then
,
but
only
within
the
narrow
scope
to
which
it
confines
itself
.
the
film
's
one
clear
failure
be
in
the
portrayal
of
the
romance
between
arroway
and
joss
.
for
one
thing
,
it
resort
to
the
tired
movie
clich
\*
that
two
attractive
people
will
immediately
fall
in
love
as
soon
as
they
appear
on
the
screen
together
,
as
there
do
not
seem
to
be
any
other
reason
for
they
instant
mutual
attraction
.
the
romance
rarely
,
if
ever
,
shed
any
light
on
the
character
,
although
it
occasionally
try
and
fail
-
joss
's
explanation
that
he
quit
the
priesthood
because
of
the
celibacy
requirement
-lrb-
''
i
guess
you
could
say
i
be
a
man
of
the
cloth
,
but
without
the
cloth
''
-rrb-
,
for
example
,
be
more
like
a
punchline
to
a
joke
than
character
development
.
instead
,
the
romance
mostly
seem
to
exist
for
the
sake
of
later
plot
development
.
grant
,
this
be
a
plot
-
and
idea-driven
film
and
the
character
be
secondary
,
but
this
just
seem
like
laziness
on
the
writer
'
part
more
than
anything
else
.
the
success
of
contact
,
however
,
far
outweigh
its
failure
.
even
if
the
social
commentary
have
fizzle
altogether
-lrb-
which
it
do
not
-rrb-
,
the
simple
yet
mysterious
story
of
alien
communication
still
would
have
make
it
a
memorable
film
.
contact
do
not
quite
cover
all
the
basis
,
but
it
cover
about
as
much
as
one
could
hope
for
in
a
two-hour
film
,
and
its
rejection
of
big-budget
theatric
for
a
more
realistic
story
be
certainly
admirable
.
and
i
would
not
be
surprise
if
,
ten
year
from
now
,
contact
be
mention
in
the
same
breath
as
2001
and
blade
runner
as
one
of
the
finest
example
of
sophisticated
and
intellectually
relevant
science
fiction
.
