how
many
of
we
would
become
stripper
?
for
those
of
we
who
would
not
,
be
it
a
moral
reason
,
or
purely
a
lack
of
confidence
?
that
be
probably
not
a
fair
question
,
and
for
a
lot
of
we
,
it
could
very
well
be
for
neither
of
those
reason
.
as
you
watch
the
full
monty
,
however
,
you
may
begin
ask
yourself
these
kind
of
question
.
would
you
be
willing
to
grin
and
bare
it
to
bring
in
some
much
need
dough
?
in
case
you
have
not
guess
,
the
full
monty
be
about
strip
,
but
striptease
it
be
not
.
it
be
actually
quite
a
charming
comedy
that
use
its
idea
with
a
great
deal
of
tact
and
sophistication
.
it
be
the
story
of
six
out-of-work
,
out-of-shape
blue
collar
brit
whose
recent
job
loss
have
leave
the
boy
penniless
,
but
not
without
need
.
what
to
do
?
it
hit
we
main
character
gaz
-lrb-
robert
carlyle
-rrb-
as
he
notice
the
large
crowd
of
woman
who
pour
into
a
local
male
strip
club
on
a
regular
basis
.
it
seem
that
simple
:
take
it
off
and
bring
in
the
cash
.
eventually
,
gaz
be
able
to
convince
he
friend
to
join
he
in
start
they
own
exotic
dance
routine
despite
they
initial
reluctance
.
these
include
the
overweight
,
confidence-lacking
dave
-lrb-
mark
addy
-rrb-
,
the
uptight
,
overly-officious
gerald
-lrb-
tom
wilkinson
-rrb-
,
the
once
suicidal
lomper
-lrb-
steve
huison
-rrb-
,
and
two
additional
fellow
who
gain
they
place
among
the
group
by
audition
:
horse
-lrb-
paul
barber
-rrb-
,
a
older
gentleman
chock
full
of
graceless
energy
,
and
guy
-lrb-
hugo
speer
-rrb-
,
a
young
well-endowed
looker
who
compare
himself
to
cary
grant
.
when
the
sextet
be
complete
,
we
be
give
a
hefty
dose
of
physical
comedy
.
we
watch
the
bumble
middle-aged
man
choreograph
pseudo-sexy
dance
number
,
all
the
while
prove
why
none
of
they
be
stripper
in
the
first
place
.
as
if
there
anti-appeal
be
not
enough
,
they
decide
to
boost
interest
in
the
group
by
promise
''
the
full
monty
''
on
open
night
,
which
for
we
american
,
mean
bare
it
all
.
.
.
and
i
mean
\*
all
\*
.
the
movie
actually
end
on
open
night
;
a
hilarious
applause
worthy
end
i
might
add
.
it
be
sure
to
leave
nothing
short
of
a
big
smile
on
you
face
as
you
leave
the
theater
.
with
the
subject
matter
,
you
might
not
expect
the
fully
monty
to
be
such
a
feel-good
,
almost
inspiring
film
,
but
it
surprisingly
turn
out
that
way
.
the
amount
of
light
,
touch
drama
also
come
as
a
nice
surprise
,
never
feel
off-balance
from
the
otherwise
highly
upbeat
moment
of
the
film
.
there
be
a
lot
more
to
this
movie
than
you
might
think
in
other
word
,
and
the
ensemble
cast
could
not
be
better
.
each
character
be
completely
individual
,
interesting
,
funny
,
and
most
importantly
,
real
.
the
full
monty
be
never
offensive
,
a
very
impressive
attribute
since
its
subject
matter
alone
could
have
easily
fall
prey
to
tastelessness
.
it
be
one
of
those
movie
that
be
best
describe
as
a
solid
piece
of
entertainment
,
perfect
for
a
great
night
on
the
town
,
or
as
a
Saturday
night
movie
rental
.
either
way
you
see
it
,
it
should
not
let
you
down
in
the
slightest
.
and
,
pun
heavily
intended
,
when
it
be
all
say
and
do
,
you
'll
be
smile
from
cheek
to
cheek
.
