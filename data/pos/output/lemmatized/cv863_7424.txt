not
since
attend
a
ingmar
bergman
retrospective
a
few
year
ago
have
i
see
a
film
as
uncompromising
in
its
portrayal
of
emotional
truth
as
secret
&
lie
.
like
bergman
,
director
mike
leigh
be
interested
in
probe
he
character
'
inner
depths
through
hypernaturally
blunt
confrontation
.
also
like
bergman
,
leigh
engage
in
frequent
closeup
of
he
character
'
ravish
and
wrack
face
.
and
the
prominent
mournfulness
of
a
cello
on
the
soundtrack
recall
bergman
's
own
use
of
a
bach
cello
suite
in
a
earlier
film
.
all
that
be
miss
be
a
discussion
of
god
.
which
be
not
to
say
that
secret
&
lie
be
nothing
more
than
a
homage
to
the
swedish
master
.
in
fact
,
it
be
quite
possible
leigh
have
no
such
intention
in
mind
.
nonetheless
,
what
we
get
be
so
far
remove
from
the
average
moviegoing
experience
--
even
from
the
reason
we
go
to
the
movie
in
the
first
place
--
that
it
take
some
effort
to
adjust
to
the
film
's
rhythm
.
once
the
adjustment
be
make
,
however
,
there
be
great
reward
.
one
such
be
the
chance
to
see
life
on
the
screen
as
it
really
be
.
though
leigh
may
have
adopt
some
of
bergman
's
stylistic
touch
,
most
obviously
in
a
early
scene
of
terse
cross-cutting
during
a
married
couple
's
strained
conversation
,
as
well
as
in
that
somewhat
obtrusive
score
,
the
overall
feeling
of
the
film
be
that
it
eschew
any
''
style
''
at
all
.
whereas
bergman
use
artifice
as
a
tool
to
expose
reality
,
leigh
make
the
camera
a
mere
observer
,
almost
as
in
a
pb
documentary
.
the
effect
of
this
be
to
focus
all
of
you
attention
on
the
actor
.
it
be
a
tribute
to
everyone
involve
that
,
despite
such
scrutiny
,
only
infrequently
be
we
aware
that
anyone
\*
be
\*
act
.
much
have
be
make
of
brenda
blethyn
's
performance
,
and
rightly
so
,
but
it
be
only
when
you
remind
yourself
that
you
be
watch
a
fiction
that
you
realize
how
good
she
be
.
there
be
a
few
misstep
.
for
one
,
except
for
one
scene
-lrb-
tragicomic
,
as
it
happen
-rrb-
,
there
be
scant
humor
in
the
film
.
this
lead
to
a
certain
monotonous
tone
throughout
.
and
occasionally
-lrb-
as
with
bergman
-rrb-
the
bluntness
of
the
situation
can
seem
force
.
for
all
that
,
this
longish
film
manage
to
keep
hold
of
you
attention
.
it
be
unfortunate
that
the
audience
for
secret
&
lie
will
most
likely
be
limit
to
a
intellectual
elite
,
for
there
be
nothing
inherently
intellectual
about
this
film
.
in
fact
,
it
might
easily
resonate
more
strongly
for
million
of
work
class
filmgoer
who
will
likely
never
see
it
.
there
be
even
a
sweet
but
significant
irony
in
the
film
's
unspoken
take
on
race
relation
,
something
a
american
audience
at
least
would
do
well
to
observe
.
nonetheless
,
secret
&
lie
be
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
.
though
there
be
nothing
physically
horrific
to
make
one
squeamish
,
the
exploration
of
common
human
frailty
can
be
so
raw
and
unsparing
that
it
be
tempting
to
turn
from
the
screen
.
needless
to
say
,
it
be
also
very
depressing
at
time
.
but
for
many
of
we
,
of
course
,
so
be
life
.
and
though
the
film
be
too
honest
to
tack
on
a
phony
happy
ending
,
that
same
honesty
allow
it
to
admit
that
thing
can
also
get
better
.
