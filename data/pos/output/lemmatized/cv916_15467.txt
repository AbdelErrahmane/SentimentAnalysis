martin
scorsese
's
triumphant
adaptation
of
edith
wharton
's
the
age
of
innocence
be
a
stunning
film
for
the
quintessential
new
york
filmmaker
,
the
man
who
bring
the
street
of
taxi
driver
and
mean
street
to
life
.
it
seem
like
a
odd
choice
for
scorsese
to
do
a
period
piece
in
the
early
1900
's
,
but
the
fact
that
he
pull
it
off
so
brilliantly
be
a
wonder
,
and
a
testament
to
the
greatness
of
scorsese
as
a
filmmaker
.
this
be
a
gorgeous
visual
experience
that
it
surely
one
of
scorsese
's
finest
.

-rrb-
be
a
prestigious
lawyer
who
be
engage
to
may
welland
-lrb-
ryder
-rrb-
,
a
somewhat
empty
and
shallow
new
yorker
,
who
belong
to
a
prestigious
family
and
be
quite
beautiful
.
the
marriage
be
one
which
will
unite
two
very
prestigious
family
,
in
a
society
where
nothing
be
more
important
than
the
opinion
of
other
.
on
the
day
that
archer
be
to
announce
he
engagement
to
may
,
countess
ellen
olenska
-lrb-
pfeiffer
-rrb-
,
cousin
of
may

walk
into
archer
's
life
.
archer
be
immediately
captivate
,
and
find
himself
in
love
with
ellen
.
archer
be
also
bind
by
the
limit
of
new
york
society
,
which
be
a
intrusive
as
any
other
in
the
world
.
archer
find
himself
have
a
secret
love
affair
in
he
mind
with
countess
olenska
,
attempt
to
keep
she
in
he
mind
while
try
not
to
lose
he
social
status
.
the
film
's
subject
matter
may
seem
alien
to
scorsese
,
but
the
theme
be
definitely
not
.
it
be
a
theme
of
forbid
romance
,
guilty
pleasure
,
and
the
consequence
cause
because
of
those
action
.
there
be
a
painstakingly
flawed
hero
,
and
he
choice
between
the
life
he
want
,
and
the
life
he
be
destine
for
.
in
truth
,
it
be
a
film
about
a
society
the
audience
do
not
know
about
,
but
want
to
find
out
more
,
much
like
the
society
of
goodfella
or
even
kundun
.
the
performance
be
absolutely
breathtaking
.
day-lewi
portray
more
mental
anguish
in
he
face
than
one
man
should
be
force
to
take
.
pfeiffer
be
marvelous
as
countess
olenska
,
a
mix
of
passion
and
beauty
that
the
audience
would
die
for
as
well
.
ryder
be
probably
the
gem
of
the
group
,
for
it
be
she
quiet
presence
that
overwhelm
the
plot
,
and
slowly
push
day-lewis
closer
and
closer
to
he
eventual
ending
.
the
support
cast
be
also
wonderful
,
with
several
character
so
singular
that
they
be
indelible
in
one
's
memory
.
scorsese
definitely
have
a
passion
for
filmmaking
.
he
lavish
and
sumptuous
set
design
and
marvelous
recreation
of
new
york
be
a
wondrous
sight
.
he
literally
transport
the
viewer
to
another
world
with
incredible
imagery
.
he
script
be
also
excellent
,
slow
in
buildup
,
with
a
rapid
conclusion
and
a
fantastic
end
that
have
to
be
see
to
be
believe
.
it
be
difficult
to
make
a
period
piece
grip
:
scorsese
,
however
,
do
it
beautifully
.
the
famous
camera
of
the
legendary
director
be
also
everywhere
.
he
be
patient
,
but
he
film
everything
and
anything
remotely
important
.
the
camera
sweep
,
pan
,
track
,
and
do
more
than
they
have
ever
do
,
but
they
be
so
subtle
,
one
do
not
realize
he
be
watch
all
the
scorsese
hallmark
until
a
2nd
viewing
.
the
central
tracking
shot
be
probably
longer
and
more
complex
than
the
famous
goodfella
shoot
,
but
the
viewer
do
not
notice
it
,
because
we
want
to
see
more
of
this
gorgeous
world
.
there
be
a
few
deft
touch
of
filmmaking
that
be
simply
outstanding
,
and
joanne
woodward
'
narration
be
exquisite
.
not
a
fast
film
like
goodfella
,
this
share
more
in
common
with
kundun
than
anything
else
.
and
like
kundun
,
this
be
a
slow-starting
film
that
truly
shine
,
when
give
the
chance
to
fully
breathe
and
bloom
in
the
end
.
a
beautiful
film
by
a
director
continue
to
challenge
himself
year
after
year
.
