well
i
'll
be
damned
...
the
canadian
can
make
a
good
movie
.
the
world
be
come
to
a
end
.
we
do
not
know
why
or
how
,
but
apparently
there
be
no
way
to
stop
it
.
the
world
have
have
this
information
for
month
,
as
most
of
the
rioting
and
other
assorted
chaos
have
pass
and
government
have
shut
down
operation
.
yet
for
a
handful
of
toronto
citizen
,
life
go
on
.
they
be
not
go
crazy
or
attack
people
in
the
street
.
instead
they
be
simply
prepare
themselves
for
the
end
...
some
engaging
in
activity
they
have
always
want
to
do
,
some
gathering
with
family
and
friend
,
and
other
just
seek
to
be
alone
.
these
people
's
life
however
all
intersect
during
they
final
six
hour
.
writer-director-star
don
mckellar
have
craft
a
highly
unique
and
emotional
film
.
all
of
the
main
character
be
compelling
as
they
try
and
do
whatever
it
be
they
need
to
do
on
they
last
night
on
earth
.

thing
seem
a
little
hokey
towards
the
beginning
of
the
film
,
but
ultimately
everything
come
together
nicely
-lrb-
although
it
be
not
a
happy
film
...
some
moment
be
understandably
gut-wrenching
-rrb-
.
the
story
be
enhance
by
some
unexpected
humor
and
very
realistic
performance
,
particularly
from
sandra
oh
,
whose
character
be
just
try
to
get
home
to
she
husband
before
the
end
.
i
have
absolutely
no
problem
that
the
reason
for
the
end
of
the
world
be
never
give
,
nor
do
it
bother
I
that
the
world
be
end
at
exactly
12
midnight
-lrb-
in
toronto
anyway
-rrb-
.
but
i
do
wonder
why
the
sun
never
set
.
come
midnight
,
the
sun
be
still
shine
brightly
.
maybe
the
sun
be
crash
into
the
earth
...
who
know
.
also
,
it
be
comforting
to
know
that
in
mankind
's
final
moment
on
the
planet
,
people
will
still
gang
up
on
the
street
for
the
sheer
purpose
of
push
over
a
car
or
a
bus
-lrb-
that
be
not
a
shot
at
this
film
mind
you
...
i
know
people
be
just
stupid
and
truly
would
be
out
in
the
street
