a
tireless
texa
pentecostal
preacher
who
unexpectedly
catch
he
wife
-lrb-
farrah
fawcett
-rrb-
in
bed
with
another
guy
.
in
a
regrettable
crime
of
passion
he
take
a
baseball
bat
to
the
guy
's
head
,
and
suddenly
find
himself
a
fugitive
for
murder
,
and
estrange
from
he
wife
and
two
kid
.
to
atone
for
he
sin
,
sonny
flee
to
a
rural
bayou
town
in
louisiana
and
baptize
himself
as
a
new
creature
-
-
the
apostle

.
as
the
apostle
e

f
.
sonny
's
main
mission
be
to
revive
a
abandon
church
community
and
preach
the
gospel
at
the
local
radio
station
.
soon
he
set
about
resurrect
the
one
way
road
to
heaven
holiness
temple
.
but
sonny
know
he
time
be
short
;
one
day
the
police
will
find
he
.
opinion
:
this
movie
be
a
thought-provoking
look
at
a
evangelist
in
real
life
term
.
i
believe
that
robert
duvall
-lrb-
who
be
the
producer
,
director
,
writer
,
and
main
star
of
the
apostle
-rrb-
deserve
a
oscar
for
he
performance
as
sonny
the
religious
crusader
-
-
a
performance
which
be
so
complex
and
realistic
it
rank
as
one
of
the
finest
act
performance
on
film
.
duvall
's
portrayal
of
a
true
believer
be
authentic
,
superb
,
and
inspire
;
it
offer
the
audience
a
completely
honest
look
at
southern
religion
,
as
well
as
a
portrait
of
a
fallible
,
complicated
man
drive
by
he
belief
.
incidentally
,
in
real
life
duvall
be
just
as
`
drive
'
in
get
the
project
underway
.
since
no
major
hollywood
studio
want
to
risk
finance
a
complex
movie
about
a
evangelist
,
the
apostle
as
a
project
lay
dormant
for
almost
13
year
before
duvall
be
able
to
get
it
do
,
pay
for
its
production
with
he
own
money
-lrb-
about
five
million
dollar
-rrb-
.
in
term
of
hard-hitting
realism
and
character
portrayal
the
apostle
would
rank
as
one
of
the
best
movie
of
this
decade
,
and
i
emphatically
recommend
the
apostle
for
connoisseur
of
stage
and
fine
act
on
film
.
similarly
,
those
with
a
steep
background
in
pentecostal
christianity
would
find
the
apostle
a
thought-provoking
experience
.
on
the
other
hand
,
the
apostle
's
main
strength
-
-
duvall
's
preach
-
-
be
also
what
limit
the
apostle
's
target
audience
.
in
term
of
plot
and
pure
entertainment
value
,
the
apostle
be
definitely
not
for
everyone
.
teenager
,
action
fan
,
comedy
fan
,
and
people
who
find
church
completely
bore
should
stay
far
away
from
this
movie
,
since
three
quarter
of
the
film
be
watch
sonny
preach
at
church
.
in
other
word
,
the
apostle
be
a
four
star
performance
,
but
with
a
very
limited
audience
.
