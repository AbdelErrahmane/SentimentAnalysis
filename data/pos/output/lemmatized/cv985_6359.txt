have
a
foot
on
either
side
of
the
line
.
he
be
,
figuratively
and
literally
,
in
both
camp
.
ernie
dingo
bring
a
great
deal
of
understand
to
this
role
as
the
man
in
the
middle
.
he
be
part
churchman
and
part
politician
.
however
the
tension
,
like
the
heat
,
fly
and
dust
,
be
always
there
.
whilst
she
husband
-
the
local
teacher
-
be
in
church
,
white
lady
kate
-lrb-
milliken
-rrb-
and
she
aborginal
friend

pedersen
-rrb-
have
go
off
into
the
hill
.
he
take
she
to
a
sacred
site
,
even
today
strictly
men-only
.
she
appear
to
not
know
this
.
tony
tell
she
that
this
be
a
special
place
,
a
initiation
place
.
he
then
make
love
to
she
,
surround
by
ancient
rock
art
.
the
community
find
out
about
this
sacrilegious
act
and
it
be
payback
time
.
the
fuse
be
light
and
the
brittle
inter-racial
peace
be
shatter
.
everyone
be
affect
in
the
fall
out
.
to
say
more
be
to
give
away
the
detail
of
this
finely
craft
film
.
suffice
to
say
it
be
a
rewarding
experience
.
bryan
brown
,
act
and
co-produce
,
be
the
pivotal
character
.
he
officer
be
real
,
human
and
therefore
flaw
.
brown
comment
that
he
expect
audience
to
feel
warmth
towards
the
man
,
then
suddenly
feel
angry
about
he
.
it
be
not
long
ago
that
i
visit
central
australium
-
ayer
rock
-lrb-
uluru
-rrb-
and
alice
spring
-
for
the
first
time
.
the
wide-screen
cinematography
show
the
dead
heart
of
australium
in
a
way
that
capture
it
be
vicious
beauty
,
but
never
deteriorate
into
a
move
slide
show
,
in
which
the
gorgeous
background
dominate
those
pesky
actor
in
the
foreground
.
the
cultural
clash
have
provide
the
thesis
for
many
a
film
;
from
the
western
to
the
birdcage
.
at
least
three
excellent
australian
film
have
cover
the
aboriginal
people
and
the
line
between
they
and
we
anglo-saxon
`
invader
'
:
''
jedda
''
,
''
the
chant
of
jimmie
blacksmith
''
and
''
the
last
wave
''
.
in
a
year
when
the
race
`
debate
'
have
rear
up
in
australium
,
it
be
nourish
to
see
such
a
intelligent
,
non-judgemental
film
as
''
dead
heart
''
.
the
aboriginal
priest
best
sum
this
up
.
he
be
ask
to
say
if
he
be
a
''
black
fellum
or
white
fellum
''
.
