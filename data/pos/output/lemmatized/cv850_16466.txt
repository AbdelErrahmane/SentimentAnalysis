some
extremely
funny
scene

place
within
the
house

's
parent
's
home
be
very
well
do
.
there
be
constantly

be
interesting
and
creative
.
they
seem
very
mediocre
,
but
they
work
out
just
fine
.
gallo

character
be
develop
very
well
.
the
impression
that
he
be
very
depressed
and
confused
be
very
clear
.
gallo
give
a
performance
that
make
you
believe
what
the
character
be
go
through
.
he
character
go
through
many
,
many
problem
,
just
like
many
people

this
character
seem
very
realistic
to
I
.
riccus

be
funny
and
different
.
she
do
not
care
much

fall
in
love
the

a
very
wonderful
actress

she
be
start
to
get
the
recognition
that
she
deserve
.

.
many
scene
be
very
dramatic
and
depressing
.
gallo
's
character
be
so
realistic
,
he
be
extremely
disturbing
.
some
scene
be
suppose
to
come
off
as
funny
,
but
they
actually
seem
sad
and
real
to
life
.
the
film
sometimes
drag
along
,
not
give
much
material
.
i
really
would
have
like

and
i
would
have
like
to
see

character
develop
more
.
