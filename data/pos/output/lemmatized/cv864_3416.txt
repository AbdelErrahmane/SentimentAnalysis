all
saucy

bumblingly
spiteful

though
that
be
probably
due
to
hogan

script
muriel

wedding
be
essentially
a
genre
teen
comedy
with
more
intelligence
and
a
lot
of
charm
.
hogan
's
use
of
abba
tune
-lrb-
which
virtually
comprise
the
entire
soundtrack
-rrb-

interestingly
appropriate
,
although
its
repetitiveness
tire
after
awhile
.
hogan

script
be
right
on
the
mark
in
term
of
proportionately
mix
comedy
with
muriel

earnest
quest
for
acceptance
,

beautifully
illustrate
the
wonder

the
glare
pastel
color
worn

be
a
interesting
touch
.
muriel
's
wedding
feature
a
fine
performance
by
tonus
collette
and
a
charming
,
if
a
bit
too
straightforward
and
conventional
story
by
p

j
.
hogan
.
on
my
four
star
scale
,
i
give
muriel
's
