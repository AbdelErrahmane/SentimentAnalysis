i
be
give
this
stinker
.
normally
,
the
worst
that
i
would
ever
rate
a
movie
would
be
.
but
the
total
waste
of
time
that
be
blaze
saddle
be
,
compound
by
the
fact
that
this
movie
be
incredibly
offensive
,
help
I
come
to
the
big
goose
egg
.
i
be
not
sure
what
the
hell
mel
brook
be
think
when
he
make
this
thing
,
or
if
he
be
even
think
at
all
.
maybe
in
mel
's
little
mind
a
horse
be
knock
unconscious
because
of
a
punch
to
the
face
be
funny
.
in
mine
,
it
be
not
.
or
maybe
mel
graduate
from
the
spike
lee
school
of
filmmaking
.
because
only
the
self-righteous
lee
use
the
n-word
more
often
in
he
film
than
brook
do
in
this
one
.
at
least
lee
have
the
smart
to
realize
that
nobody
be
go
to
find
that
term
amusing
.
brook
bandy
it
about
like
he
figure
the
audience
will
be
roll
in
the
aisle
every
time
they
hear
it
.
wrong
mel
!
i
would
call
you
a
boob
mel
,
but
that
insult
breast
everywhere
.
this
idiotic
attempt
at
a
comedy
center
on
the
evil
lieutenant
governor
's
-lrb-
harvey
korman
-rrb-
attempt
to
clear
out
a
town
so
he
can
buy
up
the
land
cheap
and
sell
it
to
the
railroad
.
he
send
he
goon
to
run
the
townsfolk
out
.
but
the
town
appeal
to
the
governor
-lrb-
mel
brook
in
one
of
many
uninspired
,
and
unfunny
role
-rrb-
to
send
they
a
new
sheriff
to
protect
they
.
the
governor
pawn
the
task
off
to
korman
's
character
hedley
lamarr
.
-lrb-
i
can
tell
you
be
roll
off
you
chair
right
now
just
think
of
all
the
humor
in
that
name
.
-rrb-
lamarr
decide
to
send
the
town
a
black
sheriff
-lrb-
gasp
-rrb-
in
the
hope
that
the
town
will
be
so
disgusted
at
the
prospect
of
a
black
man
living
among
they
that
they
will
all
just
leave
.
hold
on
,
i
have
get
to
stop
while
these
gale
of
laughter
pass
.
it
be
just
too
funny
.
racism
passing
as
humor
--
gosh
why
do
not
anybody
ever
think
of
that
one
before
?
oh
wait
,
i
think
somebody
might
have
--
they
be
call
the
kkk
.
i
be
not
call
brook
a
racist
--
but
i
be
call
he
a
insensitive
bastard
who
would
not
know
what
be
funny
if
it
hit
he
over
the
head
.
but
i
digress
.
anyway
,
the
black
sheriff
ride
into
town
amid
a
flurry
of
townsfolk
use
the
n-word
.
golly
,
will
the
hilarity
just
never
end
?
he
end
up
join
force
with
a
drunk
-lrb-
gene
wilder
-rrb-
,
who
happen
to
be
the
former
fastest
gun
in
the
west
.
together
,
they
save
the
day
from
evil
.
not
one
person
in
this
movie
give
a
decent
performance
.
wilder
look
like
he
be
recover
from
a
head
injury
for
most
of
the
movie
,
and
korman
look
embarrassed
to
be
a
part
of
the
movie
.
ok
,
he
really
do
not
--
but
he
should
have
.
the
film
star
cleavon
little
go
along
with
the
black
joke
as
if
they
be
discuss
the
time
of
day
.
i
do
not
laugh
once
during
this
whole
sorry
experience
.
i
admit
to
start
to
snicker
on
a
couple
of
occasion
.
actually
,
the
end
start
to
look
as
if
it
be
go
to
have
some
promise
,
but
alas
,
it
end
up
be
as
crappy
as
the
rest
of
the
movie
.
i
can
say
with
full
confidence
that
blaze
saddle
have
no
redeeming
quality
whatsoever
.
mel
brook
would
be
do
the
world
a
favor
if
he
burn
every
last
copy
of
this
film
.
