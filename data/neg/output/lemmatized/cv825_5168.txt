if
anyone
have
be
able
in
1983
to
forsee
a
late-night
cable
show
host
by
gilbert
gottfry
showcase
some
of
the
worst
film
of
the
80
's
,
they
would
agree
d
.
c
.
cab
be
the
quintessential
''
usa
up
all
nite
''
movie
.
it
be
one
of
those
childish
r-rated
movie
that
kid
would
love
but
can
not
see
until
it
be
edit
for
tv
.
it
be
also
one
of
those
pointless
,
almost
plotless
movie
with
hardly
any
laugh
.
and
,
strike
three
,
it
pair
mr
.
t
with
gary
busey
.
i
hear
gilbert
say
d
.
c
.
cab
have
''
a
all-star
cast
,
''
but
i
be
still
hope
there
be
some
degree
of
facetiousness
in
that
statement
.
when
third-billing
go
to
a
two-minute
appearance
by
famed
flashdancer
irene
cara
''
as
herself
,
''
you
can
not
say
a
damn
thing
about
all-star
cast
.
likewise
for
token
appearance
by
marsha
''
roz
''
warfield
,
paul
rodriguez
and
''
politically
incorrect
''
host
bill
maher
,
before
he
be
somebody

appear
in
d

pretty
much
have
the
opposite
effect
on
everyone
else
,
especially
irene

cara
.
d

c

cab
be
a
ensemble
comedy
from
joel
schumacher
-lrb-
who
would
go
on
to
direct
batman
forever
-rrb-
about
a
bunch
of
misfit
who
drive
cab
.
you
get
the
feeling
if
the
police
academy
cadet
have
make
a
different
career
choice
,
this
would
be
the
result
,
except
here
you
have
such
interesting
character
as
the
''
token
white
guy
''
-lrb-
busey
-rrb-
who
want
to
get
in
tight
with
the
black
now
before
they
take
over
the
world
,
the
token
jive
talker
name
tyrone
-lrb-
charlie
barnett
-rrb-
who
wear
he
hair
in
roller
and
use
the
word
''
honkey
''
as
much
as
possible
,
the
tough
guy
with
the
mohawk
and
gold
chain

a
real
stretch
for

.
we
have
all
see
dozen
of
bad
comedy
from
the
80
's
.
some
be
fun
to
watch
and
some
be
actually
funny
.
this
one
be
more
or
less
neither
.
you
would
think
plenty
of
comedic
spark
would
fly
from
the
assemblage
of
talent
-lrb-
whatever
-rrb-
,
but
d

c

cab
more
or
less
fall
flat
on
a
continual
basis
,
culminate
in
the
usual
contrived
hollywood
finale
as
baldwin
be
kidnap
and
the
other
cabbie
have
to
go
to
rescue
he
.
it
be
a
shame
no
one
be
able
to
rescue
this
movie
from
the
depths
of
stale
joke
and
unoriginality
.
d

c

cab
have
rightly
earn
its
position
on
