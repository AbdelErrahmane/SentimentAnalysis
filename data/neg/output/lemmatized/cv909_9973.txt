walken
star
as
a
mobster
who
be
kidnap
and
hold
for
ransom
by
four
bratty
rich
kid
.
it
seem
that
a
woman
have
also
be
kidnap
--
she
be
the
sister
of
one
of
they
-lrb-
e
.
t
.
's
henry
thoma
-rrb-
and
the
girlfriend
of
another
-lrb-
flannery
-rrb-
--
and
the
ask
price
be
$
2
million
,
which
say
snot
be
unable
to
cough
up
alone
.
they
even
cut
off
walken
's
finger
to
show
they
mean
business
,
because
they
be
desperate
to
save
the
woman
's
life
.
suicide
king
be
a
terrible
film
.
walken
aside
,
there
be
not
a
single
appealing
cast
member
.
o'fallon
create
character
that
be
functional
type
without
any
resonance
.
in
a
amusingly
unironic
scene
,
walken
play
poker
with
the
foursome
and
describe
each
of
they
personality
to
a
tee
--
it
be
as
if
he
be
read
the
summary
sheet
for
a
casting
director
.
the
plot
be
another
issue
entirely
.
o'fallon
be
someone
whom
i
be
bet
have
see
reservoir
dog
and
the
usual
suspect
too
many
time
,
for
not
only
do
he
story
veer
off
on
bizarre
tangent
from
whence
they
never
return
-lrb-
do
we
really
need
the
scene
where
dennis
leary
beat
up
a
abusive
father
with
a
toaster
,
which
be
entirely
unrelated
to
both
the
story
and
leary
's
character
,
or
the
numerous
anecdotal
sequence
?
-rrb-
,
but
the
central
plot
itself
be
a
serpentine
mess
,
fill
with
cross
and
double
cross
and
triple
cross
...
by
the
fourth
big
revelation\/twist
,
i
have
completely
tune
out
,
wonder
what
on
earth
attract
these
actor
to
the
material
.
recently
a
peer
,
a
fellow
young
filmmaker
,
inform
I
that
he
have
a
idea
for
a
movie
about
four
guy
,
the
mob
,
and
the
fbus
.
it
occur
to
I
then
what
be
wrong
with
indy
like
suicide
king
:
i
suspect
o'fallon
have
never
meet
a
mobster
,
be
not
a
rich
man
,
do
not
deliver
endless
''
clever
''
monologue
to
he
friend
about
he
favorite
type
of
boot
...
in
short
,
these
guy
be
just
riff
on
other
movie
,
and
in
do
that
,
make
the
same
film
over
and
over
and
over
again
.
tarantino
find
he
niche
and
now
hundred
of
genxer
with
movie
camera
be
try
to
find
tarantino
's
niche
instead
of
carve
they
own
.
