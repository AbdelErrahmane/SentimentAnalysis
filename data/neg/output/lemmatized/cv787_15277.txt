instrument
of
penetration
.
as
sick
as
this
all
be
,
watch
it
be
one
of
the
most
admittingly
hysterical
moment
i
have
ever
witness
.
sure
,
it
may
be
in
bad
taste
,
but
what
the
hell
be
bad
taste
other
than
something
that
may
be
offensive
to
some
but
be
riotously
amusing
to
the
rest
?
then
there
be
''
caligulum
.
''
this
film
feature
incest
,
necrophilia
,
beastuality
,
anal
rape
,
homosexual
felatio
of
both
sex
,
elaborate
and
lengthy
orgy
,
a
greased-up
fist
force
up
a
man
's
rear
,
wine
pour
down
a
man
who
be
have
he
urinary
tract
tie
off
,
a
penis
chop
off
and
feed
to
hungry
dog
,
etc
,
etc
,
etc
.
this
could
very
well
be
a
respectable
film
,
and
if
could
have
be
have
the
follow
not
occur
:
a
-rrb-
the
event
be
graphically
shoot
in
clear
view
;
b
-rrb-
the
tone
be
not
that
of
try
to
shock
comically
but
to
,
well
,
show
''
historical
accuracy
;
''
c
-rrb-
the
film
be
a
20
million
dollar
production
with
lavish
set
,
a
rather
impressive
cast
,
and
a
whopping
2 1\/2
hour
run
time
.
produce
and
fund
by
none
other
than
bob
guccione
,
owner
of
penthouse
magazine
,
''
caligulum
''
come
across
as
the
most
hysterical
dramatic
picture
since
''
plan
9
from
outer
space
''
because
underneath
there
be
a
sense
that
everything
this
film
be
do
be
not
only
accurate
and
justified
,
but
also
brilliantly
entertaining
.
after
all
,
it
be
not
really
the
fact
that
this
film
feature
the
aforementioned
disgusting
moment
,
but
that
it
actually
believe
in
they
as
dramatic
weaponry
.
no
film
should
be
discard
because
its
content
,
because
film
be
never
about
what
it
be
about
,
it
be
about
how
it
be
about
-lrb-
as
the
old
cliche
go
-rrb-
.
those
who
bash
this
film
for
content
be
glance
over
the
biggest
and
most
obvious
problem
with
''
caligulum
,
''
and
that
be
that
it
be
nothing
but
overdramaticize
bullshit
from
start
to
finish
,
without
a
second
of
credibility
in
its
mammoth
run
time
.
''
caligulum
''
allegedly
tell
the
true
story
of
the
evil
roman
emporer
of
the
same
name
,
a
man
who
be
so
insanely
decadent
that
he
assasination
come
as
a
blessing
...
or
so
i
guess
,
even
though
almost
every
single
roman
emporer
be
assasinate
as
well
and
for
much
the
same
reason
.
the
film
open
on
the
wrong
note
,
of
course
,
with
a
quote
from
mark
appear
before
any
image
grace
the
screen
,
use
the
over-used
passage
''
what
shall
it
profit
a
man
if
he
should
gain
the
whole
world
a
dlose
he
own
soul
,
''
depite
the
fact
that
the
opening
scene
of
the
film
be
of
the
emporer
before
he
be
a
emporer
,
fuck
around
with
he
own
sister
in
a
field
-lrb-
i
suppose
if
one
have
to
lose
they
soul
,
one
have
to
have
a
soul
in
the
first
place
-rrb-
.
the
plot
be
so
incomprehensibly
do
that
all
i
or
anyone
else
can
make
out
of
it
be
that
caligulum
-lrb-
disastrously
play
by
the
great
malcom
mcdowell
,
a
performance
that
do
the
opposite
that
he
performance
in
''
a
clockwork
orange
''
do
-rrb-
be
next
in
line
for
the
throne
but
can
not
wait
for
the
current
emporer
,
tiberius
-lrb-
peter
o
'
toole
-
ditto
,
only
for
he
performance
in
''
lawrence
of
arabium
''
-rrb-
,
he
grandfather
,
to
die
...
so
he
kill
he
and
ascend
to
the
throne
.
then
he
abuse
he
position
,
marry
a
woman
-lrb-
helen
mirren
,
who
retain
she
dignity
as
a
actor
by
not
exactly
act
-rrb-
so
he
do
not
just
have
to
sleep
with
he
sister
-lrb-
a
dreadful
teresa
ann
savoy
,
there
to
be
pretty
,
naked
,
and
willing
to
hop
in
the
sack
with
mac
or
anyone
he
ask
she
to
hop
in
with
-rrb-
,
abuse
he
position
a
little
more
,
a
little
more
,
and
a
little
more
,
and
then
,
i
believe
,
invade
england
,
then
be
kill
off
.
the
filler
,
instead
of
recount
he
life
,
be
suppose
to
be
,
as
guccione
claim
,
the
ultimate
portrait
of
decadent
pagan
rome
,
complete
with
orgy
,
vicious
death
,
and
lot
of
nudity
.
but
instead
of
be
the
historical
accurate
film
it
really
really
want
to
be
,
it
instead
become
guccione
's
twisted
masturbatory
image
of
what
it
could
be
like
.
oh
,
be
not
it
great
that
they
just
love
have
sex
?
and
that
they
kill
people
so
disgustingly
?
and
would
not
it
be
great
if
i
could
make
a
couple
buck
by
sell
this
shit
off
as
accuracy
even
though
it
be
so
blatantly
real
bad
porn
that
i
have
completely
convinced
myself
that
it
be
not
.
i
mean
,
why
not
just
show
a
roman
orgy
when
i
can
spend
a
good
ten
minute
examine
every
single
facet
that
make
it
up
.
and
it
be
not
just
that
it
be
disgusting
or
vile
or
whatever
adjective
you
want
to
use
to
describe
this
film
-
it
be
that
in
a
film
where
the
entire
feel
it
be
go
for
be
not
feel
,
it
be
also
the
sloppiest
expensive
movie
of
all
time
.
the
set
be
lavish
,
but
so
blatantly
innacurate
that
i
wonder
if
no
historian
want
to
have
he
name
on
this
film
explain
this
.
but
that
do
not
matter
since
the
cinematography
be
so
dark
that
you
wonder
if
a
light
meter
be
use
at
all
,
make
this
not
only
dark
and
ugly
,
but
just
plain
dark
.
the
camera
operation
be
also
the
worst
i
have
ever
see
in
my
entire
life
.
not
only
do
this
film
hold
the
record
for
the
most
unnecessary
zoom
in
one
single
shot
ever
,
but
often
the
camera
will
lose
its
subject
and
pan
around
till
they
find
they
,
then
have
they
out
of
focus
.
the
editing
be
so
sloppy
that
some
scene
be
absolutely
impossible
to
follow
.
there
be
no
writer
to
speak
of
-lrb-
what
the
hell
do
it
mean
that
it
be
''
adapt
from
a
original
screenplay
by
gore
vidal
?
''
-rrb-
,
but
nevertheless
,
the
dialogue
be
shit
,
so
laughably
bad
that
i
can
not
in
good
faith
believe
that
anyone
with
a
iq
over
5
could
say
they
with
a
straight
face
-lrb-
my
favorite
be
the
line
when
caligulum
inquire
the
doctor
about
the
health
of
the
die
tiberius
:
''
he
could
go
at
any
moment
,
but
with
care
,
he
could
last
a
year
or
so
.
''
-rrb-
the
music
in
this
film
be
mostly
prokofiev
and
khachaturian
-lrb-
they
use
he
gorgeous
''
adagio
of
spartacus
and
phrygium
,
''
ad
nauseum
-rrb-
,
use
in
a
attempt
to
give
the
film
some
emotion
,
but
instead
feel
as
if
it
be
ship
in
from
elsewhere
.
the
orgy
scene
-lrb-
and
one
infamous
lesbo
scene
between
penthouse
pet
lori
wagner
and
aneeka
dilorenzo
-rrb-
be
the
result
of
reshoot
by
guccione
himself
,
which
be
so
obviously
remove
from
everything
else
in
this
film
that
it
only
add
to
the
embrassment
-lrb-
every
five
seconds
or
so
,
the
film
cut
to
random
nudity
,
as
if
it
be
afraid
its
audience
would
forget
this
film
be
rate
''
x
''
-rrb-
.
john
gielgud
represent
the
only
voice
of
sanity
,
walk
around
in
he
brief
role
as
if
he
be
constantly
the
mantra
,
''
i
be
go
to
kill
my
agent
,
i
be
go
to
kill
my
agent
...
''
and
so
on
and
so
on
,
for
over
2 1\/2
hour
,
make
''
caligulum
''
about
as
exciting
and
enrich
as
a
three
hour
college
lecture
class
and
twice
as
deliriously
annoying
.
guccione
,
in
he
pursuit
of
historical
accuracy
have
instead
make
a
film
that
be
such
a
painstaking
,
arduous
task
to
watch
in
its
entirety
that
i
doubt
anyone
can
sit
through
a
hour
of
it
without
irreversible
psychological
damage
.
throughout
the
entire
film
,
the
presence
of
guccione
be
easily
feel
,
as
if
he
be
stand
there
at
the
edge
of
the
screen
,
pretentiously
look
down
upon
we
say
''
look
what
i
can
get
away
with
!
and
if
you
do
not
like
this
,
then
you
be
a
prig
,
and
worse
than
that
,
you
know
nothing
about
history
!
''
uh
huh
.
there
be
a
clear
difference
between
historical
accuracy
and
do
something
that
be
artistically
good
.
a
film
which
show
roman
decadence
as
something
that
be
perhaps
liberating
for
some
but
could
not
last
-
that
would
probably
make
for
a
good
film
.
but
use
historical
accuracy
as
a
licence
to
get
away
with
any
kind
of
disgusting-for-disgustingness
'
-
sake
act
be
total
,
total
bullshit
,
and
all
i
can
say
be
that
guccione
and
the
maker
of
this
film
have
lose
any
kind
of
touch
with
either
entertainment
or
eroticism
,
and
have
develop
a
pathetic
and
sadistic
taste
for
both
,
judge
from
this
film
.
there
be
a
film
that
come
out
in
1989
call
''
the
cook
,
the
thief
,
he
wife
,
and
she
lover
,
''
a
magnifcent
film
by
legendary
cult
director
peter
greenaway
-lrb-
also
star
helen
mirren
-rrb-
,
which
deal
with
graphic
sex
,
heartstopping
violence
and
gore
,
and
even
a
little
cannibalism
for
good
measure
.
that
film
not
only
never
patronize
its
viewer
,
but
also
handle
they
in
a
way
that
be
shocking
,
yes
,
but
also
,
in
a
bizarre
way
,
entertaining
and
totally
involve
.
there
be
real
character
there
in
a
real
situation
,
and
best
of
all
passion
and
just
the
right
amount
of
restraint
as
not
to
get
off
on
the
fact
that
it
be
go
to
be
offensive
to
many
.
that
film
achieve
everything
it
want
to
do
,
and
have
since
retain
a
status
as
one
of
those
cult
film
that
be
not
only
popular
but
actualy
good
.
and
it
be
everything
''
caligulum
''
might
have
be
but
,
alas
,
be
not
.
