blazingly
ridiculous
that
it

I
to
drift
into

pretty
good
deal
eh

but
luke
soon
learn
that
the

somewhat
suffocating
;
when

become
extreme
,
there
be
no
way
he
can
leave
the

maybe
as
a
drool

the
premise
,
although
lack
in
originality

certainly
offer
its

of
potential

unfortunately
,
`

neither

nor
anything

you
would
associate

it
be
just
another

not
the

`

so
bad
it
attain
a
certain
level

conspicuous
when

on

of

they

a
key
to

gee
,
why
not

but
my
favorite
bit
be
this
:
the

would

they

to
retrieve

and
maybe
afterward
they
can
play
ping-pong

i
be
still
chuckle
about
these
ludicrous
detail
,
but
the
humiliating
dialogue
be
enough
to
send
one
into
arrest

the
cast
,
meanwhile
,
combine
a
pinch
of
veteran
talent
with
a
dash
of
the
`
dawson

crowd
,
and
fuse
the
two
together
,
ensure
that
the
embarrassment
will
be
a

make
you
wonder
why

because
while

they
belong
on

mechanical

formulaic
plot

sheepishly
overlook
the
cool
potential
of

underground

flick

instead
of

about
the

as

we
be
thrust
into
a
lame
video

conspiracy

we
have

it

`
the

a
feeble
little

miscalculate
