have

that
they
can

up
the

sadly
,
if
this
dismal
,
cliche
ridden
and
mind-numbingly
boring
action
pic
be
anything
to
go
by
,
they
have
not
get
a
chance
in
hell
of
even
come
close
.
this
time
out

the
duo
play
foster
brother
who
be
transit
cop
.
follow
several
run-in
with
they
tyrannical
boss
-lrb-
robert
blake
-rrb-
,
who
be
obsess
with
the
''
money
train
''
--
a
train
which
carry
all
the
subway
's
takings
--
and
will
let
nothing
stop
it
-lrb-
now
\*
there
be

a
original

device
-rrb-
,
harrelson
's
character
decide
to
try
and
take
off
with
the
cash

along
the
way
,
both
of
they
fall
in
love
with
the
same
woman
--
another
transit
cop
who
also
hate
she
boss
.
this
lead
to
the
typical
sibling
rivalry
crap
that
you
usually
find
in
a
film
of
this
standard
-lrb-
`
you
be
always
the
better
brother
'
etc
.
etc
.
etc
.
-rrb-
,
and
do
not
help
to
add
anything
to
the
film
.
give
a
better
script
,
better
performer
in
support
role
and
a
shorter
running
time
-lrb-
the
film
almost
go
for
two
hour
--
or
do
it
just
feel
like
it
?
-rrb-
,
this
film
might
-lrb-
and
i
mean
\*
might
\*
-rrb-
have
turn
out
okay
,
but
as
it
be
,
it
be
stock
with
the
worst
action
film
cliche
,
whose
only
purpose
appear
to
be
to
pad
the
film
out
to
its
painfully
long
run
time
.
robert
blake
,
who
play
the
evil
boss
,
have
get
to
be
the
most
pathetic
bad
guy
in
film
history
!
he
sound
like
wayne
newton
,
and
appear
to
think
the
best
way
to
appear
evil
be
to
have
you
eye
bulge
as
though
they
be
about
to
burst
out
of
they
socket
!
but
this
be
only
one
of
money
train
's
problem
.
if
you
look
at
the
script
as
if
it
be
a
action
film
,
it
lack
originality
and
suspense
.
but
if
you
try
to
look
at
it
as
if
it
be
a
heist
film
,
it
be
even
worse
.
the
final
robbery
sequence
be
almost
trivialise
and
the
character
definitely
be
not
butch
and
sundance
.
the
film
be
not
all
bad
though
.
snipe
and
harrelson
,
when
they
be
not
use
the
dumb
cliche
that
the
script
give
they
,
make
a
agreeable
duo
,
and
some
of
the
stunt-work
be
indeed
excellent
.
but
good
stunt-work
can
not
save
a
bottom-of-the-barrel
action
movie
.
if
you
be
a
really
undemanding
action
freak
,
there
be
a
chance
you
'll
like
this
.
but
if
you
be
look
for
something
original
,
or
suspenseful
,
try
somewhere
else
--
i
doubt
you
'll
find
it
here
.
