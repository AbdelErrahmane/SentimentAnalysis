''
mafia
!
''
-
crime
be
not
a
funny
business
by

1998
on
a
particular
night
when
i
find
myself
have
some
free
time
,
i
have
a
chance
to
either
go
to
sleep
early
or
to
see
''
mafia
!
''
,
a
spoof
of
mafia
and
crime
film
such
as
''
the
godfather
,
''
''
goodfella
''
and
''
casino
''
.
at
84
minute
in
length
,
i
think
that
i
could
enjoy
a
few
laugh
before
get
a
good
night
sleep
.
but
by
my
account
,
i
think
that
my
laff-o-meter
only
register
a
few
grin
,
one
giggle
,
and
maybe
one
chortle
.
i
suppose
that
you
could
justify
you
time
as
homage
to
the
venerable
hollywood
star
,
lloyd
bridge
,
who
just
recently
pass
away
and
whose
last
performance
be
in
this
film
.
''
mafia
!
''
chronicle
vincenzo
cortino
's
-lrb-
lloyd
bridge
-rrb-
life
.
separate
from
he
family
when
he
be
young
,
he
escape
to
america
and
try
to
live
a
honest
life
.
but
as
fate
would
have
it
,
vincenzo
grow
up
to
be
a
powerful
and
klutzy
crime
lord
.
follow
in
he
footstep
be
he
two
son
,
joey
-lrb-
billy
burke
-rrb-
and
anthony
-lrb-
jay
mohr
-rrb-
.
like
all
sibling
in
powerful
crime
family
,
they
squabble
over
power
,
the
future
of
the
family
,
fortune
,
and
woman
.
''
mafia
!
''
be
co-write
by
jim
abraham
,
who
also
contribute
to
some
gut-busting
funny
spoof
such
as
''
airplane
''
and
''
the
naked
gun
.
''
but
these
previous
movie
be
funny
because
the
joke
seem
more
universally
understand
and
there
be
more
of
a
manic
silliness
at
work
.
as
i
write
this
,
i
also
wonder
how
many
people
have
actually
see
the
movie
on
which
this
spoof
be
base
.
crime
movie
in
general
contain
a
lot
of
profanity
and
violence
.
it
be
a
tough
genre
to
parody
.
i
be
kind
of
hope
that
they
could
somehow
spoof
the
profanity
use
in
all
of
those
crime
movie
,
maybe
by
have
all
of
the
tough
crime
lord
say
''
please
''
as
they
decide
which
sector
to
take
over
,
but
this
opportunity
be
never
explore
.
there
be
one
or
two
moment
that
make
I
smile
such
as
the
scene
where
vincenzo
be
dance
with
he
newly
wed
daughter-in-law
.
a
gunman
shoot
he
several
time
.
the
impact
of
the
bullet
cause
he
to
make
these
wild
contortion
that
force
the
wedding
band
to
change
music
style
to
keep
up
with
he
,
from
the
samba
to
disco
to
the
macarena
.
i
think
that
i
just
give
away
the
best
part
of
the
film
.
oh
well
,
that
just
mean
that
you
can
go
to
sleep
a
little
earlier
.
