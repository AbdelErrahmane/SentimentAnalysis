get
a
priest
to
be
he
mountain
guide
after
tell
he
the
true
story
.
the
film
be
watchable
just
for
the
antic
of
the
jeff
goldblum
comic
performance
.
he
be
someone
come
apart
by
the
seam
,
while
mimi
roger
be
he
perfect
foil
.
it
be
mostly
pantomine
humor
,
with
the
comedy
charge
in
the
change
facial
expression
of
the
character
and
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
.
a
very
minor
farce
that
might
appeal
to
the
sitcom
crowd
.
the
film
just
do
not
take
its
situation
seriously
and
the
story
have
many
gap
in
it
,
so
it
have
no
chance
for
black
humor
to
develop
.
it
instead
play
its
set-up
of
the
henpecked
husband
act
out
he
fantasy
strictly
for
entertainment
value
to
see
how
many
chuckle
it
could
draw
.
