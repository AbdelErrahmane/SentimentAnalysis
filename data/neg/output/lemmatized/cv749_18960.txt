a
film
that
bank
almost
entirely
on
exploitation
and
offensive
pseudo-depth

what
be
worse
be
that
the
movie
be
haphazardly
glue
together
by

be
neither
interesting

sympathetic

the
ridiculous

reach

-rrb-
only
after
we
have
spend
twenty
minute
or
so
with
these
character
do
we
learn
that
they
have
a
sordid
history
together
;
this
angle
,
though
apparently
present
to
develop
they
character
,
be
never
explore
.
not
that
it
really
matter
,
since
the
character
consistently
do
ludicrous
thing
for
no
other
reason
than
to
drive
the
plot
.
in
one
scene
,
sunderland
be
attack
by
a
man
in
a
mask
.
she
see
one
of
he
ring
,
and
she
and
brenner
find
the
man
later
that
day
base
on
the
ring
.
instead
of
question
he
like
as
they
would
a
real
suspect
,
they
take
he
to
brenner
's
houseboat
,
beat
he
up
,
and
pour
hot
coffee
in
he
lap
.
this
scene
really
push
I
over
the
edge
,
not
because
it
be
gratuitous
and
mean-spirited
,
but
because
it
illustrate
the
film
's
complete
disregard
for
the
character
and
the
audience
.
it
be
impossible
for
I
to
feel
anything
for
these
people
beyond
this
scene
,
mostly
because
nothing
they
do
come
as
a
surprise
.
i
realize
that
these
construct
on
screen
be
not
actually
character
,
but
device
present
only
to
serve
the
story
.
this
would
have
be
bad
enough
without
the
west
's
need
to
hose
he
movie
down
in
tasteless
image
of
rape
and
sexual
misconduct
.
compelling
film
about
sexual
crime
do
not
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
rape
flashback
,
and
they
certainly
do
not
show
as
much
skin
and
sweat
as
a
typical
pornographic
picture
.
these
scene
be
not
the
least
bit
powerful
;
on
the
contrary
,
they
be
intend
simply
to
provide
the
audience
with
the
necessary
resentment
for
the
villain
,
whomever
that
may
turn
out
to
be
.
in
addition
,
the
movie
treat
sexual
fetish
--
and
sadomasochism
in
particular
--
as
if
it
be
a
perversion
of
everything
we
know
to
be
pure
.
this
standpoint
be
certainly
allow
,
but
only
in
accompaniment
with
well-developed
theme
to
back
it
up
.
as
it
be
,
the
film
forget
that
a
lot
of
people
have
sexual
fetish
,
and
that
put
on
a
pair
of
handcuffs
do
not
make
a
person
insane
.
perhaps
the
only
positive
element
in
the
general
's
daughter
be
a
couple
of
the
performance
.
jame
wood
have
a
few
terrific
scene
,
and
play
he
role
with
sharp
,
witty
subtlety
.
i
also
like
jame
cromwell
,
mostly
because
he
come
across
as
slightly
sympathetic
despite
the
obvious
intent
of
west
to
make
he
villainous
.
nonetheless
,
these
performance
be
undermine
entirely
by
the
dreary
,
obligatory
atmosphere
and
the
senseless
neglect
of
characterization
.
the
general
's
daughter
be
the
worst
kind
of
hollywood
film
--
it
pretend
to
have
a
soul
,
to
be
of
strict
moral
code
,
when
in
fact
it
have
nothing
more
than
a
group
of
cardboard
cut-out
force-feed
the
audience
a
toxic
landfill
of
plot
contrivance
and
one-sided
moral
judgment
.
