do
not
let
this
movie
fool
you
into
believe
the
romantic
noir
of
william
shakespeare
.
no
one
will
truly
understand
the
heart
and
soul
of
this
man
except
through
he
work
,
and
this
movie
make
a
vain
attempt
at
that
.
any
move
to
?
glamorise
'
he
life
,
which
hollywood
have
a
annoying
tendency
to
do
,
will
only
subtract
from
he
achievement
rather
than
expound
on
he
greatness
.
this
movie
about
he
life
,
although
well
write
,
put
too
much
make-up
on
a
man
whose
life
be
probably
more
pork
and
potato
,
rather
than
lobster
and
champagne
.
oh
well
,
let
's
fantasise
onward
a
assume
that
he
be
a
bit
of
a
flirtatious
play-write
,
who
fall
in
love
with
a
beautiful
woman
-lrb-
gwyneth
paltrow
-rrb-
and
from
she
inspiration
,
several
play
develop
-
?
romeo
and
juliet
'
,
and
?
the
twelfth
night
'
.
it
be
easier
for
I
to
believe
that
he
have
a
wet
dream
and
that
be
how
all
he
play
develop
,
but
please
spare
I
all
of
this
unnecessary
melodrama
.
but
i
guess
my
version
probably
would
not
draw
a
crowd
or
make
a
dollar
on
screen
.
so
be
there
any
justification
in
romanticise
the
man
shakespeare
,
when
all
we
need
to
do
be
read
he
work
in
order
to
find
he
soul
.
i
think
not
.
as
for
the
oscar
be
they
deserve
by
this
movie
?
i
think
not
.
in
many
aspect
?
private
ryan
'
and
?
life
be
beautiful
'
be
far
superior
movie
,
but
one
should
never
assume
that
this
should
be
a
criterion
for
win
a
oscar
,
as
time
and
again
,
for
reason
unexplained
,
a
undeserving
movie
will
win
the
accolade
.
another
sore
point
be
the
fact
that
gwyneth
win
the
best
female
lead
,
over
a
more
polished
cate
,
but
i
guess
if
you
go
on
enough
about
you
grandfather
die
and
you
nephew
be
hospitalise
-
people
will
start
feel
sorry
for
you
.
