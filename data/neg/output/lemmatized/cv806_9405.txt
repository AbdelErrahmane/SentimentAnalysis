in
1989
,
tim
burton
take
the
legendary
comic
book
figure
of
batman
and
turn
he
into
a
huge
box
office
hit
with
a
atmospheric
little
film
that
create
a
utterly
distinct
feeling
somewhere
between
film
noir
and
the
godfather
.
be
it
''
deep
''
?
nope
.
however
it
be
a
perfect
entertainment
and
the
audience
eat
it
up
.
it
be
natural
that
roger
ebert
trash
it
write
that
it
be
''
without
the
comic
book
uplift
''
of
the
indiana
jone
and
superman
picture
.
which
be
true
.
if
what
you
be
look
for
be
the
tale
of
a
heroic
man
's
escadape
and
adventure
you
be
look
in
the
wrong
place
.
if
those
film
be
tom
sawyer
,
then
batman
be
huckleberry
finn
.
some
critic
-lrb-
glenn
lovell
of
the
san
jose
mercury
news
and
peter
traver
of
roll
stone
-rrb-
realize
that
it
be
something
special
;
mr
.
lovell
give
it
\*
\*
\*
1\/2
and
write
that
''
this
be
batman
as
batman
should
be
.
''
;
mr
.
traver
call
it
one
of
the
ten
best
film
of
the
year
.
the
praise
be
deserve
-
from
start
to
finish
the
film
be
enthralling
,
exciting
,
and
superb
in
every
respect
.
there
be
no
doubt
that
there
would
be
a
sequel
direct
by
burton
.
the
result
be
batman
return
which
forget
that
it
want
to
be
fun
within
the
first
five
minute
.
the
villain
-lrb-
the
hideous
penguin
and
seductive
catwoman
-rrb-
take
over
,
and
we
epectation
be
always
leave
unfulfilled
-
when
we
want
the
penguin
to
bite
off
batman
's
nose
he
simply
get
mad
,
and
when
we
want
catwoman
to
slither
over
batman
's
body
she
get
push
off
a
building
.
i
admire
mr
.
burton
for
try
to
do
more
then
entertain
,
but
the
result
be
a
mess
.
nothing
work
out
as
plan
-
it
fail
both
to
entertain
and
to
enlighten
.
hint
be
make
to
the
audience
that
this
film
could
be
a
blast
.
alas
,
these
be
only
hint
.
there
be
,
do
not
misunderstand
I
,
several
moment
of
cinematic
genui
contain
;
catwoman
and
batman
understand
eachother
perfectly
without
a
word
on
the
subject
be
say
;
christopher
lloyd
be
trap
,
by
the
penguin
,
within
a
giant
cage
;
a
small
basket
be
drop
into
a
large
river
;
but
nothing
be
draw
together
and
burton
be
unable
to
make
the
film
work
on
any
regular
basis
.
a
weak
followup
,
both
career
and
sequel
wise
,
batman
return
be
sometimes
dazzling
,
but
to
often
dissapointing
.
