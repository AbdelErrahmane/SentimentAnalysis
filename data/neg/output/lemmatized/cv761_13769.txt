there

spielberg
's
greatest
strength
as
a
director
be
the
polished
,
formulaic
way
in
which
every
aspect
of
the
film
fall
carefully
into
place
to
make
a
perfect

but
for
a
topic
of
such
weight
as

this

there

be
quite
possibly
the
closest
anyone
have
come
to
actually

unendurably
savage
intensity
of
modern

another
please
aspect
of
the
film
be
spielberg
's
brave
depiction
of
scene
largely
unknown
to
american
audience
,
such
as
the
shooting
of
prisoner
by
ally
soldier
,
the
banality
of
death
in
combat
,
the
routine
foul-up
in
the
execution
of
the

,
and
the
cynicism
of
the
troops
.
the
technical
side
of
the
film
be
peerless
,
as
always
.
the
camera
work
be
magnificent
,
the
pacing
perfect
,
the
set
convincing
,
the
directing
without
flaw
.
hank
will
no
doubt
be
nominate
for
a
oscar
for
he
performance
,
which
be
utterly
convincing
,
and
the
support
cast
be
excellent
,
though
ted
danson
seem
a
mite
out
of
place
as
a
paratroop
colonel
.
yet
the
attempt
at
a
realistic
depiction
of
combat
fall
flat
on
its
face
because
realism
be
not
something
which
can
be
represent
by
single
instance
or
event
.
it
have
to
thoroughly
permeate
the
context
at
every
level
of
the
film
,
or
the

with

for
example
,
we
see
only
one
man
with
gut
spill
out
on
the
ground
.
here
and
there
man
lose
limb
;
in
one
scene
miller
be

to
safety
,
there
be
a
explosion
,
and
miller
look
back
to
see
he
be
only
pull
half
a
man
.
but
the
rest
of
the
corpse
be
remarkably
intact
.
there
be
no
shoe
with
only
foot
in
they
,
no
limb
scatter
everywhere
,
no
torso
without

,
no

and
most

,
all

in
fairness
there

smattering
of

the
relentless
dehumanization
of
the
war
,
in
which
even
corps
fail
to
retain
any
indentity
,
be
soft-pedal
in
the
film
.
ultimately
,
_

bow
to
both

the

rather

''
it
would
be
better
to
describe
it
as

''
another
aspect
of
the
''

of

this
be

the
more

because

,
so

however
,
the
most
troubling
aspect
of
the
film
be
the
spielbergization
of
the
topic
.
the
most
intense
hell
human
have
ever
create
for
themselves
be
not
emotionally
wrenching
enough
for
steven
spielberg
.
he
can
not
just
cede
control
to
the
material
;
he
have
to
be
bigger
than
it

as
if

the

spielberg

to

it
in

and

to

that

be
so
hokey
,
so
predictable
,
it
nigh
on

nowhere
in

there
a
resolute

meaninglessness
,

which

because
