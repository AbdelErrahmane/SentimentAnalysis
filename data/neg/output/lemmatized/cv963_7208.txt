where
do

go

not

the
acting
.
clint
eastwood
,
ed
harri
and
gene
hackman
as
the
president
give
type-cast
,
but
decent
performance
.
the
cinematography
be
sufficient
;
wild
and
erratic
during
action
sequence
,
dark
and
mysterious
during
psychologically
suspenseful
scene
,
and
calm
and
warm
during
dramatic
dialogue
.
even
the
music
be
not
as
bombastic
as
it
usually
tend
to
be
in
the
thriller\/suspense
genre
.
the
fault
clearly
lie
in
the
screenplay
,
and
the
screenplay
alone
.
while
set
up
a
story
about
misuse
of
power
,
about
the
true
possessor
of
that
power
,
and
about
intrigue
and
double-crossing
,
it
do
not
resolve
it
.
not
one
buildup
of
suspense
be
resolve
by
a
exciting
climax
.
rather
,
the
tense
situation
be
leave
dangle
at
the
end
,
give
the
viewer
a
uneasy
sense
of
incompleteness
.
a
example
of
this
be
a
very
promising
and
tense
buildup
of
a
scene
:
in
a
attempt
to
arrest
clint
eastwood
,
the
police
have
set
up
a
trap
at
a
small
restaurant
.
police
officer
be
everywhere
,
incognito
of
course
.
at
the
same
time
,
not
one
but
two
hit
man
be
prepare
to
kill
clint
eastwood
when
he
arrive
.
all
three
party
be
unaware
of
each
other
presence
.
this
scene
be
tremendously
exciting
and
the
audience
be
wonder
how
clint
eastwood
,
who
might
suspect
this
be
a
trap
,
will
get
himself
out
of
this
difficult
position
.
he
will
probably
have
a
brilliant
plan
,
involve
ingenious
preparation
.
however
,
when
he
arrive
at
the
trap
,
both
hit
man
miss
-lrb-
how
convenient
-rrb-
and
in
the
confusion
eastwood
simply
walk
away
.
the
buildup
of
this
scene
take
about
ten
minute
.
ten
minute
of
close
up
of
the
hit
man
load
they
weapon
intercut
with
the
police
prepare
for
the
trap
.
the
scene
be
resolve
in
less
than
20
seconds
...
parallel
to
the
story
line
of
catch
the
real
killer
be
a
cliche
emotional
tale
about
the
estrange
relationship
between
father
eastwood
and
he
daughter
.
the
daughter
blame
she
father
for
never
be
there
for
she
,
because
he
be
either
in
jail
or
rob
a
house
somewhere
.
of
course
they
relationship
take
a
turn
for
the
better
during
the
adventure
and
they
end
up
a
happy
family
.
again
,
it
be
commendable
that
absolute
power
try
to
deviate
from
the
mainstream
suspense
film
by
give
room
for
a
dramatic
subplot
.
however
,
try
be
simply
not
enough
!
the
second
story
line
should
be
subtle
,
original
and
preferably
unpredictable
...
everything
this
film
be
not
.
how
could
a
screenplay
like
absolute
power
ever
get
the
funding
to
be
produce
?
how
could
eastwood
,
who
have
successfully
produce
and
direct
many
outstanding
film
such
as
the
brilliant
unforgiven
,
ever
believe
in
a
project
like
this
one
?
i
be
sad
to
say
that
my
respect
for
the
actor\/director\/producer
have
diminish
substantially
due
to
this
film
.
director
quentin
tarantino
once
say
:
''
i
can
make
a
good
movie
out
of
any
bad
script
.
''
director
clint
eastwood
obviously
can
not
.
