it
be
difficult
to
expect
much
from
a
director
whose
greatest
accomplishment
to
date
be
a
handful
of
''
award-winning
''
tv
commercial
,
as
be
the
case
with
bubble
boy
director
blair
haye
.
that
say
,
haye
's
feature
film
debut
live
up
to
expectation
,
come
off
mainly
as
equal
part
offensive
and
moronic
.
but
occasionally
,
bubble
boy
transcend
its
substandard
root
with
glimmer
of
humor
and
scathing
social
commentary
.
those
moment
of
intelligence
be
deliver
mostly
by
the
film
's
two
star
,
jake
gyllenhall
as
the
immuno-deficient
jimmy
and
swoosie
kurtz
as
he
over-protective
,
hyper
religious
,
reagan-loving
mother
.
gyllenhall
's
sweet-natured
delivery
of
jimmy
's
hilariously
na
?
ve
narration
serve
as
the
backbone
for
a
otherwise
flimsy
coming-of-age
story
:
jimmy
be
a
bubble
boy
,
a
kid
bear
without
immunity
who
could
die
if
he
come
in
contact
with
a
single
germ
--
a
plight
explore
more
seriously
in
the
john
travolta
tv
movie
boy
in
the
plastic
bubble
and
less
so
on
seinfeld
.
he
mom
home-school
jimmy
,
fill
he
head
with
wildly
twisted
conservative
propaganda
and
anti-sexual
message
,
until
he
be
befriend
by
chloe
-lrb-
marley
shelton
-rrb-
,
the
beautiful
girl
next
door
.
jimmy
fall
in
love
with
chloe
,
but
be
afraid
that
he
love
will
literally
kill
he
,
as
evidence
in
a
scene
when
she
drunkenly
try
to
enter
he
bubble
for
a
kiss
.
but
when
chloe
decide
to
marry
she
high
school
boyfriend
,
jimmy
build
a
bubble
suit
and
embark
on
a
hijinks-addled
cross-country
voyage
to
stop
the
wedding
by
profess
he
love
.
the
offensive
bit
have
little
to
do
with
jimmy
's
rare
handicap
-lrb-
regardless
of
what
the
film
's
protester
would
have
you
believe
-rrb-
,
but
instead
center
on
outrageous
racial
stereotype
,
include
a
scream
chinese
strip
club
owner
and
a
devout
east
indian
hindus
.
but
even
if
you
find
stereotype
humor
funny
,
it
be
hard
to
muster
more
than
a
giggle
for
these
shallow
gag
.
they
even
manage
to
bungle
some
potentially
great
moment
with
a
group
of
carnival
freak
.
but
a
few
of
the
harsh
jab
manage
to
work
,
especially
in
the
case
of
kurtz
,
who
very
bluntly
show
the
dark
,
hypocritical
side
of
the
religious
right
,
and
a
wacky
send-up
of
a
cult
call
''
bright
'n
shiny
,
''
lead
by
the
inimitable
fabio
.
unfortunately
,
a
few
giggle
can
not
make
bubble
boy
the
riotous
,
off-the-wall
comedy
it
so
desperately
want
to
be
.
honestly
,
it
be
a
mystery
how
on
earth
this
movie
be
ever
make
,
and
i
be
not
just
say
that
because
it
be
so
mediocre
.
how
odd
for
disney
to
take
a
gamble
on
a
film
with
a
unknown
director
star
virtually
unknown
actor
that
do
not
seem
to
appeal
to
any
particular
demographic
and
have
the
potential
to
offend
so
many
.
and
now
that
the
studio
be
suffer
through
a
very
public
protest
against
the
film
by
the
parent
of
real-life
bubble
boy
david
philip
vetter
,
maybe
disney
's
wonder
the
same
thing
.
hope
the
opening
box
office
take
make
it
worthwhile
.
