nostalgia
for
the
70s
continue
,
as
we
see
a
revival
of
one
of
the
decade
's
greatest
achievement
:
the
marijuana
comedy
.
however
half
baked
do
not
quite
run
with
all
its
brain
cell
,
and
will
make
you
appreciate
the
questionable
talent
of
cheech
and
chong
all
the
more
.
the
plot
follow
the
misadventure
of
four
ne'er
-
do-well
stoner
.
there
be
the
group
's
unofficial
leader
,
thurgood
-lrb-
david
chappelle
-rrb-
,
scarface
-lrb-
guillermo
diaz
-rrb-
,
brian
-lrb-
jim
breuer
-rrb-
,
and
kenny
-lrb-
harland
william
-rrb-
.
kenny
get
into
trouble
,
when
,
while
on
a
munchie
run
,
feed
he
snack
food
to
a
diabetic
police
horse
.
when
the
animal
keel
over
,
he
find
himself
accuse
of
kill
a
police
officer
,
and
face
a
$
1
,
000
,
000
bail
.
he
friend
promise
to
raise
money
for
a
10
%
bail
bond
,
but
have
no
idea
how
.
that
be
,
until
thurgood
stumble
upon
a
stash
of
pharmaceutical
marijuana
be
test
at
the
company
where
he
work
as
a
janitor
.
soon
the
three
guy
be
deal
dope
to
raise
fund
,
while
avoid
the
cop
and
rival
dealer
sampson
simpson
-lrb-
clarence
williams
iii
-rrb-
.
for
a
comedy
,
the
film
be
pretty
humorless
.
not
that
it
do
not
try
...
it
be
just
that
the
comic
setup
be
obvious
and
the
payoff
nearly
all
fall
flat
.
the
four
lead
be
nearly
all
play
the
same
character
.
only
william
stand
out
-lrb-
while
still
perform
on
the
level
of
he
humor-free
comedy
rocket
man
-rrb-
,
but
that
be
because
he
be
imprison
throughout
most
of
the
film
,
give
a
much
needed
change
of
pace
-lrb-
but
mostly
swap
one
set
of
obvious
gag
for
another
-rrb-
.
to
help
out
,
the
film
be
packed
full
of
cameo
.
steven
wright
,
tommy
chong
,
janeane
garofalo
,
willie
nelson
,
snoop
doggy
dogg
,
and
jon
stewart
all
make
appearance
at
one
point
or
another
.
none
of
they
work
,
beyond
the
simple
''
hey
,
that
be
_____
''
level
.
in
fact
the
funniest
work
in
the
film
come
from
chappelle
.
not
as
he
bland
pothead
lead
,
but
in
he
second
role
,
as
a
pot-obsessed
rapper
,
sir
smokealot
.
grant
,
it
be
pretty
much
a
one-joke
role
,
and
there
be
not
a
ton
of
laugh
...
but
this
film
need
every
one
it
can
scrape
up
.
to
top
it
off
,
and
in
a
move
contrast
with
the
tone
of
the
rest
of
the
film
,
thurgood
be
give
a
love
interest
,
mary
jane
-lrb-
rachel
true
-rrb-
.
she
role
be
that
of
the
public
service
announcement
:
to
inform
we
why
do
drug
-lrb-
include
pot
-rrb-
be
wrong
.
she
character
seem
fabricate
merely
as
a
defense
to
the
''
you
film
promote
the
use
of
drug
''
camp
.
the
film
would
have
be
better
off
by
stick
with
the
''
rebel
''
tone
it
so
eagerly
try
to
claim
.
yet
,
in
the
end
,
it
do
not
really
matter
.
watch
the
film
clean
and
sober
,
you
be
bind
to
recognize
how
truly
awful
it
be
.
