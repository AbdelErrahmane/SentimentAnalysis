i
guess
that
if
a
very
wild
bachelor
party
have
go
really
bad
,
there
would
be
break
furniture
,
trace
of
smack
and
cocaine
on
the
floor
,
and
a
dead
prostitute
in
the
bathroom
.
i
guess
that
if
a
movie
have
also
go
really
bad
,
there
might
be
the
same
element
present
.
coincidence
?
poor
kyle
-lrb-
a
meek
look
jon
favreau
-rrb-
...
he
be
about
to
marry
he
radiant
fiancee
,
laura
-lrb-
cameron
diaz
-rrb-
.
but
before
he
exchange
he
vow
,
he
embark
to
las
vegas
with
he
friend
for
one
last
blowout
.
but
this
bachelor
party
have
go
about
as
bad
as
it
could
possibly
get
.
the
prostitute
have
meet
a
horrible
,
though
accidental
death
,
and
drug
be
everywhere
.
the
five
friend
agree
that
there
be
enough
bad
evidence
here
that
will
send
they
to
jail
for
a
very
long
time
.
a
surprisingly
calm
robert
boyd
-lrb-
christian
slater
-rrb-
,
who
look
like
he
be
groom
to
make
nefarious
decision
,
ponder
they
dilemma
for
a
few
minute
before
decide
that
the
best
thing
to
do
be
to
bury
the
body
in
the
desert
where
she
'll
never
be
find
.
although
they
stomach
the
gruesome
deed
of
get
rid
of
the
body
-lrb-
which
also
disturbingly
involve
dismantle
the
body
use
power
saw
in
order
to
stuff
it
into
suitcase
-rrb-
,
when
they
return
from
they
trip
,
guilt
and
paranoia
begin
to
set
in
which
slowly
consume
some
of
the
five
friend
.
one
be
adam
-lrb-
daniel
stern
-rrb-
he
grow
increasingly
agitate
.
whenever
people
look
at
he
van
or
whenever
a
cop
glance
he
way
,
he
blood
pressure
increase
.
or
that
just
may
be
because
of
he
dysfunctional
family
.
another
be
michael
,
who
be
actually
responsible
for
she
death
.
he
try
to
bury
he
feeling
,
but
the
burden
of
guilt
begin
to
affect
he
judgment
as
well
.
boyd
be
the
?
doer
'
of
the
group
.
seemingly
suffer
from
a
long
psychosis
,
when
he
feel
as
if
he
secret
be
about
to
be
expose
,
he
be
apt
to
take
extreme
measure
to
cover
up
he
track
.
kyle
just
hope
that
he
wedding
will
live
up
to
laura
's
demand
expectation
.
then
,
there
be
moore
-lrb-
leland
orser
-rrb-
who
speak
5
line
and
walk
around
with
a
puzzle
look
on
he
face
.
the
problem
with
this
reprehensible
movie
be
that
it
want
to
be
a
cruel
comedy
,
but
it
present
thing
in
a
manner
that
just
be
not
funny
.
drug
,
mutilation
,
and
kill
you
own
friend
be
not
something
to
be
laugh
at
.
as
a
straight
psychological
drama
,
i
could
see
how
it
might
have
work
,
as
each
one
try
to
maneuver
and
overcome
the
weight
of
they
own
guilt
in
they
own
sometimes-sick
way
.
but
this
movie
insult
we
by
assume
that
we
could
simply
discard
we
value
for
2
hour
.
if
you
do
like
this
movie
,
i
do
not
think
that
i
want
to
know
you
.
i
do
find
slater
a
convincing
leader
who
sway
he
friend
to
choose
not
the
right
thing
but
the
?
smart
play
.
'
and
diaz
add
some
brightness
to
this
film
as
a
wedding-needing
fiancee
.
but
she
talent
be
essentially
waste
here
.
it
be
obvious
that
the
film
maker
be
try
to
strike
a
certain
tone
.
but
the
way
that
he
choose
to
do
it
be
tasteless
.
do
not
make
a
very
bad
decision
by
see
this
film
.
