my
first
exposure
to
the
nightmare
on
elm
street
series
of
film
be
not
this
one
,
but
in
fact
the
third
installment
-lrb-
it
be
the
first
to
gain
a
national
theatrical
release
-rrb-
.
i
do
not
see
the
first
film
until
much
later
.
so
look
back
,
the
original
do
not
hold
a
lot
of
great
memory
for
I
,
since
i
do
not
think
too
much
of
it
when
i
initially
see
it
.
watch
it
now
for
a
second
time
confirm
that
it
be
a
overrated
horror
film
that
ultimately
make
no
sense
whatsoever
.
you
all
know
the
story
by
now
:
child
murderer
freddy
krueger
-lrb-
robert
englund
-rrb-
return
from
the
grave
by
haunt
the
dream
of
the
child
of
those
who
burn
he
alive
year
before
.
this
first
installment
do
a
adequate
job
with
it
be
low
budget
,
but
there
be
some
absurd
dialogue
and
conceptual
problem
with
the
story
.
plus
the
movie
's
ending
-lrb-
understandably
the
result
of
the
studio
want
the
end
of
the
film
to
have
a
''
hook
''
for
a
sequel
-rrb-
render
the
rest
of
the
film
pointless
.
and
do
anyone
understand
what
happen
to
nancy
's
mother
at
the
end
of
this
film
?
do
not
get
I
wrong
though
...
it
be
not
as
if
a
new
generation
of
horror
film
have
spurn
I
away
from
the
classic
.
most
horror
movie
release
today
be
just
as
inane
as
this
film
be
.
horror
be
a
difficult
genre
to
pull
off
credibly
,
and
a
nightmare
on
elm
street
just
do
not
cut
it
.
a
nightmare
on
elm
street
be
available
on
dvd
from
new
line
home
video
.
it
be
available
both
as
a
single
disc
and
as
part
of
the
nightmare
on
elm
street
collection
box
set
.
the
film
be
present
in
both
pan
and
scan
and
it
be
original
theatrical
aspect
ratio
of
1
.
78
:
1
-lrb-
although
on
the
disc
that
come
in
the
box
set
,
only
a
widescreen
transfer
be
provide
-rrb-
.
the
film
have
be
digitally
remaster
and
include
two
option
for
audio
:
a
mono
mix
and
a
new
dolby
digital
5
.
1
mix
.
also
include
on
the
dvd
be
a
full-length
audio
commentary
track
with
writer\/director
we
craven
,
star
john
saxon
and
heather
langenkamp
,
and
the
film
's
director
of
photography
.
other
extra
include
the
''
jump
to
a
nightmare
''
feature
-lrb-
i
be
sure
you
can
figure
that
one
out
-rrb-
,
the
usual
cast
and
crew
bio
-lrb-
which
be
from
the
film
's
original
press
release
kit
,
and
notably
leave
out
robert
englund
and
johnny
depp
!
-rrb-
,
and
the
film
's
original
theatrical
trailer
.
some
dvd-rom
feature
be
also
include
,
but
since
i
do
not
have
dvd-rom
capability
i
can
not
really
get
into
that
.
the
commentary
track
be
entertaining
and
informative
,
but
nothing
spectacular
.
the
first
thing
of
note
be
that
it
be
the
same
commentary
track
that
be
on
the
special
edition
laserdisc
from
a
few
year
ago
.
i
be
not
say
that
be
a
negative
thing
,
just
point
it
out
.
everyone
seem
enthusiastic
about
be
there
,
with
the
possible
exception
of
john
saxon
,
who
just
do
not
say
much
at
all
.
most
of
the
time
you
'll
forget
he
be
even
there
.
everyone
else
talk
really
quietly
though
for
some
reason
,
as
if
because
they
be
comment
on
a
scary
movie
that
they
need
to
stay
as
quiet
as
possible
.
the
bonus
disc
with
the
boxed
set
call
the
nightmare
series
encyclopedia
feature
about
45
minute
worth
of
interview
relate
to
the
first
film
of
the
series
.
also
include
be
the
original
theatrical
trailer
and
two
alternate
ending
to
the
film
...
however
you
can
only
access
one
easily
.
the
other
be
hide
in
what
be
call
''
the
labyrinth
''
,
which
might
possibly
be
the
most
annoying
feature
of
a
dvd
ever
create
.
basically
,
it
be
a
interactive
game
of
sort
where
you
wander
through
different
nightmare
location
look
at
object
which
give
you
access
to
extra
little
snippet
of
footage
,
interview
,
etc
.
somewhere
in
the
labyrinth
be
the
second
alternate
end
to
the
film
.
find
it
though
be
both
a
chore
and
a
bear
.
