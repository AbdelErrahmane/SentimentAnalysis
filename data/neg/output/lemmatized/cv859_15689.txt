in
1989
,
director
edward
zwick
begin
he
career
with
the
powerful
civil
war
drama
,
''
glory
,
''
but
since
then
,
he
have
make
continuous
disappointment
,
to
I
at
least
,
with
1994
's
''
legend
of
the
fall
,
''
and
1996
's
''
courage
under
fire
.
''
those
two
film
be
not
bad
,
just
not
very
good
,
but
with
zwick
's
latest
film
,
''
the
siege
,
''
he
have
finally
make
one
.
''
the
siege
,
''
be
a
modern-day
action-thriller
that
focus
on
terrorism
that
be
sweep
through
new
york
city
.
investigate
the
matter
be
fbi
agent
anthony
hubbard
-lrb-
denzel
washington
-rrb-
and
frank
haddad
-lrb-
tony
shalhoub
-rrb-
,
who
be
first
hit
by
the
ordeal
when
a
city
bus
explode
with
several
innocent
people
on
it
.
later
,
a
bomb
go
off
in
a
broadway
theater
,
kill
even
more
.
they
soon
meet
cium
operative
elise
kraft
-lrb-
annette
bening
-rrb-
,
who
may
very
well
hold
the
key
to
the
identity
of
the
arab
terrorist
.
there
be
some
movie
that
simply
do
not
need
to
be
make
,
and
,
''
the
siege
''
may
very
well
be
one
of
they
.
oh
,
sure
,
zwick
think
he
be
make
a
''
meaningful
''
action
film
,
since
he
have
add
lot
of
exposition
scene
in
which
the
audience
be
basically
lecture
on
the
horror
of
terrorism
,
but
what
he
really
have
make
be
actually
no
more
substantial
than
,
say
,
''
die
hard
,
''
which
also
star
bruce
willi
.
this
time
,
willi
be
horribly
waste
as
a
general
of
the
u
.
s
.
army
,
who
put
a
state
of
martial
law
over
nyc
during
the
climax
.
whatever
point
,
''
the
siege
,
''
earnestly
try
to
make
,
be
obviously
lose
in
the
translation
from
page
to
screen
,
or
maybe
,
zwick
never
really
have
anything
serious
to
say
in
the
first
place
.
the
role
of
the
arab
community
be
offensively
stereotypical
,
just
as
woman
be
in
the
recent
,
''
john
caprenter
's
vampire
,
''
by
place
they
all
in
the
category
of
''
bad
guy
.
''
''
the
siege
,
''
contain
three
fine
actor
--
washington
,
bening
,
and
shalhoub
--
but
washington
be
stick
with
a
character
that
contain
not
a
ounce
of
even
remote
development
.
bening
have
slightly
more
to
do
,
and
have
a
intriguing
character
to
work
with
,
while
shalhoub
pretty
much
steal
the
show
,
even
though
,
again
,
he
have
no
real
character
.
by
the
climax
of
,
''
the
siege
,
''
with
washington
give
a
sermon
to
willi
on
the
so-called
''
message
''
of
the
story
,
i
feel
like
i
have
wander
into
a
sequel
to
,
''
on
deadly
ground
,
''
in
which
steven
seagal
give
a
10-minute
speech
at
the
end
about
preserve
the
environment
.
''
the
siege
''
be
constantly
heavy-handed
,
not
entertaining
or
insightful
,
and
just
go
to
prove
that
not
even
the
best
actor
can
save
a
film
that
lack
a
satisfactory
screenplay
.
