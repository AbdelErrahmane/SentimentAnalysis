i
can
imagine
how
good
krippendorf
's
tribe
must
have
look
on
paper
.
it
do
not
surprise
I
in
the
least
that
a
group
of
extremely
talented
actor
,
lead
by
the
great
richard
dreyfuss
and
a
good
director
-lrb-
todd
holland
-rrb-
,
all
want
to
make
this
film
.
in
fact
,
it
be
only
the
expertise
by
which
this
excruciatingly
bad
script
have
be
execute
that
keep
I
from
suggest
that
you
stay
as
far
away
from
krippendorf
's
tribe
as
possible
.
in
retrospect
,
i
can
imagine
how
bad
this
film
could
have
be
.
i
shudder
at
the
possibility
of
awfulness
have
it
star
a
actor
less
able
than
dreyfuss
.
dreyfuss
play
jame
krippendorf
,
a
anthropologist
who
be
grant
$
100
,
000
by
he
university
to
find
a
undiscovered
tribe
in
new
guinea
.
halfway
into
he
two-year
expedition
,
he
wife
-lrb-
apparently
-rrb-
die
.
i
say
apparently
because
when
or
how
she
die
be
never
truly
establish
.
later
,
we
find
out
that
much
of
the
grant
money
be
spend
on
big-screen
tv
and
other
such
pleasure
.
so
,
when
krippendorf
find
out
what
happen
to
professor
who
do
not
use
they
grant
money
wisely
,
he
decide
to
construct
a
elaborate
lie
.
he
make
he
own
tribe
,
use
he
three
child
as
actor
in
a
video
.
he
simply
make
up
certain
incredible
fact
about
this
tribe
-lrb-
which
he
call
the
shelmickedmu
-rrb-
.
audience
at
krippendorf
's
lecture
be
amaze
by
he
finding
that
the
shelmickedmu
practice
circumcision
.
and
proof
that
the
typical
family
unit
be
lead
by
a
single
father
be
truly
amazing
to
the
anthropological
community
.
like
all
film
like
this
,
the
lie
become
more
and
more
complex
,
and
the
suspense
be
generate
with
we
wonder
at
what
point
it
be
all
go
to
fall
out
from
under
we
hero
.
dreyfuss
be
a
funny
,
talented
man
,
and
he
be
funny
in
this
film
.
he
have
lot
of
positive
energy
and
,
unlike
most
comical
actor
,
really
manage
to
play
people
like
this
realistically
.
this
film
also
require
a
lot
of
physical
humor
that
i
have
never
see
dreyfuss
perform
,
and
he
do
a
great
job
.
jenna
elfman
,
who
play
veronica
mecillus
,
a
scientist
who
want
in
on
krippendorf
's
work
,
be
also
very
funny
and
appealing
here
.
and
the
kid
actor
be
great
,
as
well
.
but
we
be
talk
about
the
script
from
hell
.
this
be
one
of
those
story
that
require
such
extreme
suspension
of
disbelief
that
they
might
as
well
have
establish
that
the
story
just
take
place
in
a
alternate
universe
where
thing
like
this
can
happen
.
but
the
ridiculousness
of
the
story
be
not
really
what
be
so
bad
about
it
.
all
the
cliche
and
the
irritating
plot
device
could
have
easily
be
overcome
by
dreyfuss
and
crew
.
no
,
the
script
be
plague
with
so
many
clueless
stereotype
and
mean-spirited
character
that
i
be
in
disbelief
as
i
watch
.
furthermore
,
the
manor
in
which
all
of
this
material
be
cover
up
be
truly
shameless
.
take
,
for
instance
,
the
scene
in
which
krippendorf
get
veronica
drunk
so
he
can
tape
they
have
sex
.
they
get
all
deck
out
in
the
tribe
getup
,
complete
with
paint
to
darken
they
skin
.
krippendorf
do
this
because
he
need
footage
of
the
mating
ritual
of
he
tribe
.
now
,
i
see
this
scene
come
from
a
mile
away
,
but
i
say
to
myself
,
''
no
,
that
would
be
far
too
tasteless
.
there
be
no
way
they
'll
do
that
...
oh
god
!
''
they
do
do
it
.
it
be
there
.
i
be
almost
more
appal
by
the
fact
that
this
do
not
bother
the
other
audience
member
with
whom
i
see
this
film
.
i
find
it
deplorable
.
and
when
krippendorf
be
force
to
admit
that
he
do
it
,
he
simply
apologize
without
the
slightest
hint
of
conviction
in
he
voice
.
the
film
be
fill
with
scene
like
these
.
they
not
only
insult
the
audience
,
but
they
insult
the
type
of
people
that
the
film
portray
.
it
would
take
some
truly
professional
work
to
create
video
convince
enough
to
fool
a
entire
community
of
scientist
,
yet
krippendorf
do
it
easily
in
a
afternoon
.
and
watch
dreyfuss
stumble
over
a
completely
unprepared
speech
be
funny
and
entertaining
,
but
i
think
that
most
member
of
the
on-screen
audience
would
be
able
to
see
that
he
be
make
everything
up
as
he
go
.
if
i
be
a
anthropologist
,
this
film
would
insult
I
immensely
.
move
right
along
,
the
film
play
off
every
stereotype
we
culture
have
ever
learn
regard
african
tribe
.
sure
,
dreyfuss
dress
up
like
a
chief
be
really
funny
,
and
it
allow
for
some
entertaining
scene
,
but
the
heart
of
this
material
be
deeply
clueless
as
to
the
theme
and
thought
that
it
provoke
.
it
be
because
of
dreyfuss
as
a
actor
that
i
be
able
to
watch
this
film
.
he
character
here
be
not
a
good
subject
for
a
film
because
he
be
a
shameless
liar
,
and
never
once
do
he
show
any
kind
of
penance
for
what
he
do
.
i
suppose
it
be
interesting
to
see
the
formulum
defy
in
this
case
,
but
for
the
purpose
of
good
taste
,
i
would
have
expect
something
.
no
,
this
man
set
a
terrible
example
for
he
kid
and
colleague
,
and
the
writer
of
the
film
-lrb-
charlie
peter
-rrb-
do
not
include
a
single
scene
in
which
krippendorf
take
he
kid
aside
and
tell
they
that
what
he
be
do
be
very
bad
.
in
fact
,
it
be
he
eldest
daughter
that
frequently
tell
he
that
he
be
do
the
wrong
thing
,
and
he
continually
shrug
off
she
warning
.
i
suppose
it
be
important
to
admit
that
this
be
a
funny
film
.
dreyfuss
and
elfman
,
and
many
of
the
contrived
and
insulting
scene
,
add
up
to
a
picture
that
be
anything
but
boring
.
and
if
you
be
less
serious
than
i
,
you
probably
will
enjoy
it
.
i
,
however
,
can
not
get
past
these
element
.
krippendorf
's
tribe
be
be
market
as
a
family
comedy
,
but
this
be
the
kind
of
film
that
teach
the
kid
of
we
society
faulty
lesson
that
they
should
not
be
learn
.
with
a
little
more
insight
into
its
story
and
theme
,
this
could
have
be
a
good
movie
.
