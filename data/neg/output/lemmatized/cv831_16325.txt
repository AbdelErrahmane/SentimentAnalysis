one
of
the
most
blatantly
obvious
sign
that
often-acclaimed
director
sidney
lumet
's
''
glorium
,
''
a
remake
of
the
1980
john
cassavete
film
,
have
absolutely
no
effect
on
I
occur
when
i
be
drive
home
from
the
theater
.
suddenly
,
i
realize
that
since
i
have
stand
up
from
my
theater
seat
five
minute
before
,
i
have
not
think
once
about
the
film
i
have
just
invest
nearly
two
hour
of
my
life
in
.
when
a
movie
be
over
,
be
not
we
suppose
to
think
about
it
for
a
while
,
and
have
a
conversation
about
it
with
the
acquaintance
we
have
just
watch
it
with
?
i
think
so
,
but
,
for
one
,
i
see
this
particular
picture
by
myself
,
and
#
2
,
even
if
i
have
be
with
someone
there
would
not
have
be
anything
to
talk
about
in
the
first
place
.
to
be
sure
,
''
glorium
''
begin
with
a
stir
,
rather
poignant
prologue
in
which
a
seven-year-old
boy
's
family
be
brutally
gun
down
by
mobster
,
in
search
of
a
disc
he
father
have
with
incriminate
evidence
on
it
.
right
before
the
man
break
in
,
of
course
,
he
father
give
he
the
disc
to
escape
with
.
eventually
,
the
boy
,
name
nicky
nunez
-lrb-
jean-luke
figueroa
-rrb-
,
be
catch
by
the
mobster
,
and
take
back
to
they
apartment
.
meanwhile
,
glorium
-lrb-
sharon
stone
-rrb-
have
just
get
out
of
prison
for
a
crime
she
do
not
commit
and
return
to
she
ex-boyfriend
-lrb-
jeremy
northam
-rrb-
to
recieve
the
money
he
promise
she
for
cover
up
he
crime
.
when
he
refuse
to
give
it
to
she
,
and
then
hear
the
group
of
man
talk
about
kill
nicky
,
she
leave
with
he
in
order
to
save
he
life
,
but
not
before
hold
the
man
at
gunpoint
,
steal
all
of
they
money
,
and
force
they
to
strip
nude
.
glorium
be
the
type
of
fast-talking
,
smart-mouthed
new
yorker
who
always
seem
to
get
involve
with
the
wrong
people
,
and
she
never
expect
to
be
stick
with
a
kid
,
but
she
have
a
heart
of
gold
-lrb-
do
not
they
always
in
this
type
of
movie
-rrb-
and
be
only
try
to
protect
the
boy
,
whom
she
quickly
begin
to
form
a
close
bond
with
.
the
previous
incarnation
of
''
glorium
''
by
cassavete
and
star
the
luminous
gena
rowland
,
remain
unseen
by
I
,
but
be
no
doubt
superior
,
even
though
i
can
not
really
imagine
how
this
considerably
dull
story
could
be
transform
into
a
entertaining
one
,
regardless
of
the
director
or
star
.
there
be
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
director
lumet
have
stick
closely
to
the
original
,
but
the
film
itself
be
simply
lifeless
,
with
only
a
occasional
laugh
pop
up
here
and
there
so
that
it
be
not
completely
unbearable
to
watch
.
i
like
,
for
example
,
a
very
funny
climactic
sequence
where
glorium
be
decide
whether
to
leave
the
school
she
have
leave
the
boy
at
,
and
keep
turn
the
car
around
,
then
drive
a
little
way
,
then
slam
on
the
brake
and
turn
around
again
.
these
bright
moment
,
however
,
appear
long
and
far
between
,
and
the
majority
of
the
film
deal
with
the
bud
relationship
between
nicky
and
glorium
,
which
be
both
painfully
predictable
and
by-the-numbers
.
throughout
,
my
mind
be
repeatedly
ask
the
question
,
''
who
really
care
?
''
as
glorium
,
sharon
stone
have
adopt
a
over-the-top
brooklyn
accent
that
honestly
do
not
sound
realistic
at
all
.
in
the
beginning
,
in
fact
,
i
be
amaze
at
how
amateurish
stone
's
performance
be
,
but
as
the
film
progress
she
get
better
.
although
not
one
of
she
better
turn
,
stone
do
have
a
comic
flare
that
refuse
to
be
ignore
.
jean-luke
figeroa
be
fine
as
nicky
and
a
little
more
natural
than
the
usual
child
actor
who
be
so
precocious
they
make
you
want
to
gag
.
all
other
actor
who
appear
be
considerably
waste
,
none
more
than
cathy
moriarty
,
a
entertaining
actress
in
she
own
right
,
who
be
bill
fourth
and
have
all
of
one
scene
,
as
glorium
's
friend
whom
she
turn
to
for
help
.
sony
,
the
studio
that
release
''
glorium
,
''
obviously
do
not
have
any
faith
in
the
film
,
and
i
do
not
blame
they
.
they
decline
to
screen
the
picture
for
critic
,
which
be
never
a
good
sign
,
particularly
with
the
high-profile
people
involve
.
although
how
much
money
a
movie
make
do
not
determine
how
good
it
be
-lrb-
just
look
at
the
spectacular
''
in
dream
,
''
which
fail
to
even
make
the
top
10
last
week
-rrb-
,
i
have
a
suspicion
''
glorium
''
be
go
to
vanish
from
theater
faster
than
''
ishtar
,
''
judge
from
the
opening
night
7
:
00
p
.
m
.
show
i
see
it
at
,
where
there
be
about
ten
to
fifteen
people
present
,
count
myself
.
although
stone
can
be
a
impressive
actress
-lrb-
just
watch
she
in
1995
's
''
casino
''
or
1996
's
''
last
dance
''
if
you
do
not
believe
I
-rrb-
and
sidney
lumet
can
be
a
respectable
director
,
there
be
no
reasoning
for
why
they
think
the
cliched
story
of
''
glorium
''
be
worth
remake
or
,
for
that
matter
,
why
columbium
picture
agree
to
finance
it
when
they
could
have
be
make
a
picture
that
actually
look
like
it
might
have
a
inkling
of
a
chance
to
be
successful
.
