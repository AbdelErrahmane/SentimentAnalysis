well
,
if
you
have
not
see
when
harry
meet
sally
or
he
say
,
she
say
,
or
if
you
do
not
watch
love
&
war
on
television
,
you
might
think
this
be
the
most
inventive
film
to
come
along
in
age
.
however
,
if
you
have
see
any
of
these
,
than
you
have
see
most
of
this
film
.
this
of
course
do
not
mean
its
bad
.
some
of
it
be
amusing
,
but
overall
,
i
just
have
to
ask
what
be
the
point
?
arye
cross
be
the
stereotypical
single
male
who
fall
in
love
.
kevin
pollack
be
the
stereotypical
female-fearing
best
friend
who
make
a
lot
of
rather
sexist
and
vulgar
joke
,
most
if
which
be
not
very
funny
.
couteney
cox
be
the
stereotypical
career-minded
woman
who
fall
in
love
.
julie
brown
be
the
stereotypical
bizarre
best
friend
of
say
woman
.
-lrb-
notice
the
frequent
use
of
the
word
stereotypical
.
this
film
use
a
lot
of
formulum
,
the
plot
be
basically
know
from
the
opening
credit
.
-rrb-
so
what
be
good
about
the
movie
?
well
as
i
say
there
be
a
few
amusing
moment
.
surprisingly
,
julie
brown
,
who
i
usually
find
just
plain
goofy
,
be
the
best
thing
in
the
film
.
also
there
be
several
very
funny
sequence
involve
analysis
of
the
human
mating
ritual
.
gee
,
this
be
really
short
.
not
much
to
say
about
the
film
really
.
it
be
just
kind
of
there
.
watch
it
on
video
might
not
be
a
complete
waste
of
time
,
but
i
would
not
recommend
hire
a
baby
sitter
or
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
see
it
at
the
theater
.
