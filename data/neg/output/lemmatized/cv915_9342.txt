there
be
only
one
presidential
election
every
four
year
,
but
it
seem
like
every
few
month
we
get
another
presidential
conspiracy
movie
paint
as
_
the
_
thriller
of
the
year
.
in
1997
,
we
have
have
absolute
power
,
air
force
one
,
shadow
conspiracy
and
murder
at
1600
.
this
one
be
about
as
lame
duck
as
old
gerald
ford
,
try
to
bring
we
a
complex
plot
of
cover-up
and
intrigue
but
cop
out
over
and
over
again
with
rehash
of
action
flick
standby
.
here
's
what
happen
this
time
.
it
be
night
at
the
white
house
.
a
secretary
be
have
sex
with
some
unidentified
guy
with
a
cute
butt
.
the
next
day
she
be
dead
and
hotshot
detective
wesley
snipe
be
call
in
.
how
do
we
know
he
be
a
hotshot
?
we
have
see
the
traditional
action
flick
opener
--
the
clever
hostage
negotiation
scene
.
it
be
not
so
clever
this
time
,
consist
of
snipe
disarm
a
suicidal
ex-government
employee
hold
a
gun
to
he
head
in
the
middle
of
the
street
.
snipe
be
off
to
the
white
house
,
where
he
find
the
secret
service
head
-lrb-
the
shiny
bald
head
of
daniel
benzalus
-rrb-
will
not
cooperate
with
he
at
all
.
in
fact
,
if
not
for
the
intervention
of
national
security
adviser
alan
alda
,
snipe
would
not
have
be
allow
in
the
white
house
at
all
.
alda
help
snipe
out
further
,
assign
a
sexy
secret
service
agent
-lrb-
diane
lane
-rrb-
to
act
as
he
liaison
...
a
very
dangerous
liaison
.
well
,
not
really
,
i
just
want
to
say
that
.
almost
immediately
,
a
suspect
be
find
,
a
eccentric
night
janitor
see
flirt
with
the
decease
on
one
of
the
security
video
.
snipe
do
not
buy
it
,
and
launch
into
a
independent
investigation
of
he
own
,
one
that
reveal
plant
evidence
and
romantic
involvement
by
the
president
's
son
.
snipe
'
partner
,
a
always
-
wisecrack
dennis
miller
,
call
he
up
every
once
in
awhile
with
more
news
and
lane
,
who
at
first
do
not
believe
snipe
,
eventually
and
predictably
come
around
,
and
risk
she
ass
to
break
into
social
security
storage
and
break
out
some
classify
information
.
for
the
first
hour
or
so
,
murder
at
1600
look
like
it
could
be
go
somewhere
interesting
.
sure
,
we
have
to
sit
through
the
lame
opening
sequence
and
plenty
more
lame
scene
after
that
,
but
the
whole
murder
in
the
white
house
thing
make
for
a
interesting
premise
that
be
never
quite
deliver
upon
.
snipe
and
lane
do
not
make
for
a
bad
action
team
,
but
with
nothing
to
work
with
,
they
be
just
cog
in
the
bad
movie
machine
.
denni
miller
might
as
well
not
even
be
in
the
movie
;
they
waste
he
talent
more
in
murder
at
1600
than
they
do
in
bordello
of
blood
,
and
that
be
say
a
lot
.
when
you
get
to
the
last
half-hour
,
the
movie
have
descend
metaphorically
and
literally
into
a
wet
sewer
,
bust
out
the
old
break-into-the-building
underground
climax
.
and
when
they
finally
reveal
who
kill
the
woman
and
why
,
you
'll
wish
you
never
sit
through
this
movie
at
all
.
the
''
1600
''
in
the
movie
's
title
do
not
represent
a
address
,
it
represent
the
number
of
satisfied
customer
worldwide
.
serve
the
world
for
nearly
1\/25th
of
a
century
!
