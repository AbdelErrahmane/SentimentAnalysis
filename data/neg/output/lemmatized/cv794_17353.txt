time
on
he
thought-transference

.
elderly
,
evil
scientist
everett
longstreet
switch
mind
with
britt
's
boy
,
in
the
meantime
,
and
go
completely
mental
.
comment
:
naked
soul
open
with
a
naked
woman
,
and
the
movie
make
no
illusion
that
it
be
a
sci-fi
vehicle
design
to
show
pamelum
anderson
's
,
um
,
talent
.
if
you
be
really
interested
in
see
anderson
's
talent
,
however
,
i
suggest
you
skip
over
this
dud
and
watch
the
infamous
pam
and
tommy
lee
honeymoon
sex
tape
,
now
available
on
home
video
.
at
least
with
that
''
movie
,
''
you
do
not
have
to
go
through
the
painful
experience
of
watch
pamelum
try
to
pronounce
multiple
syllable
word
like
''
eclectic
.
''
a
premise
do
exist
in
the
movie
.
basically
,
while
anderson
wear
skimpy
clothes
which
barely
contain
she
talent
,
she
practice
she
art
--
brilliantly
slapping
plaster
of
pari
on
naked
woman
.
she
boyfriend
,
meanwhile
,
spend
20
hour
a
day
in
a
morgue
try
to
view
the
memory
of
dead
prison
inmate
because
this
will
''
make
a
difference
to
humanity
.
''
whatever
.
the
movie
fail
to
explain
how
these
two
hook
up
.
be
grateful
.
after
we
meet
the
evil
everett
longstreet
,
lot
of
technobabble
and
mystical
mumbo-jumbo
get
toss
about
,
pammy
have
sex
replete
with
cheesy
make-out
music
,
and
mind
get
transfer
.
never
fear
,
though
,
pammy
use
she
sharp
mental
ability
-lrb-
ahem
-rrb-
to
save
she
boyfriend
in
the
end
.
unfortunately
,
no
one
save
the
movie
.
avoid
this
would-be
sci-fi
thriller
,
unless
you
be
in
for
a
good
laugh
or
two
.
