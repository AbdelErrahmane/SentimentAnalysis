two
co-star

lisa

diane

of
the

time
?
excuse
I
,
again
,
while
i
almost
bust
a
gut
at
that
truly
delusional
notion
.
eve
mark
-lrb-
meg
ryan
-rrb-
be
the
middle
mozzell
sister
,
still
live
in
the
californium
town
where
she
grow
up
,
and
with
a
husband
-lrb-
adam
arkin
-rrb-
and
pre-teen
son
-lrb-
jesse
jame
-rrb-
.
she
elderly
,
wisecracking
father
,
lou
-lrb-
walter
matthau
,
in
he
brightest
performance
in
year
-rrb-
have
just
recently
be
put
into
the
hospital
,
in
the
final
stage
of
what
i
assume
be
alzheimer
's
-lrb-
even
though
the
film
never
enlighten
we
on
exactly
what
be
wrong
with
he
-rrb-
.
while
eve
's
relationship
with
she
mother
-lrb-
clori
leachman
-rrb-
be
nearly
nonexistent
,
since
she
run
out
on
lou
and
she
child
year
ago
,
she
have
have
she
fair
share
of
up
's
and
down
's
with
lou
,
who
use
to
be
a
alcoholic
.
she
older
sister
be
georgium
-lrb-
diane
keaton
-rrb-
,
a
editor
for
the
self-titled
magazine
,
''
georgium
,
''
while
maddy
-lrb-
lisa
kudrow
-rrb-
be
the
youngest
,
a
soap
opera
actress
.
interestingly
,
they
profession
be
give
,
but
we
not
once
ever
see
they
work
at
they
job
,
or
,
for
that
matter
,
learn
much
of
anything
about
they
.
maddy
,
georgium
,
and
eve
do
not
see
each
other
much
anymore
,
they
adult
life
gradually
cause
they
to
drift
apart
,
but
they
do
manage
to
consistently
talk
on
the
phone
to
one
another
.
and
they
talk
.
and
talk
.
and
talk
...
in
fact
,
the
telephone
be
the
major
star
of
the
film
,
even
more
so
than
ryan
,
as
it
appear
in
virtually
every
scene
of
this
interminable
92-minute
catastrophe
that
feel
like
its
three
hour
long
.
if
you
be
able
to
get
through
the
opening
half-hour
,
in
which
phone
ring
so
much
you
feel
like
jump
through
the
screen
and
take
a
sledgehammer
to
they
,
you
will
surely
survive
the
rest
.
the
question
be
,
who
would
want
to
subject
themselves
to
this
resolutely
irritating
,
self-involved
pat-on-the-back
?
how
could
a
comedy-drama
that
have
the
star-power
of
meg
ryan
,
lisa
kudrow
,
and
diane
keaton
be
so
very
bad
in
so
many
different
way
?
issue
from
the
past
involve
the
possible
jealousy
each
have
have
for
one
of
the
other
be
fleetingly
bring
up
,
but
the
film
be
not
mature
enough
to
deal
with
such
a
thing
in
a
thoughtful
manner
,
and
since
we
learn
next
to
nothing
about
they
childhood
,
it
be
a
lose
cause
that
come
off
as
nothing
more
than
a
afterthought
.
also
,
it
be
expect
that
the
viewer
quickly
catch
on
to
the
tricky
dynamic
that
the
three
sister
have
with
one
another
,
but
no
dynamic
metamorphosize
.
and
when
they
do
reunite
in
the
finale
,
they
whole
consanguinity
be
reduce
to
a
repulsively
annoying
three-minute
scene
in
which
they
argue
like
little
child
.
you
can
see
the
impending
death
come
a
mile
away
,
and
it
conveniently
occur
in
the
next
scene
,
so
that
the
three
can
quickly
come
to
term
with
themselves
,
and
with
each
other
.
you
think
to
yourself
:
''
the
only
thing
leave
for
they
to
do
be
have
a
playful
food-fight
,
''
and
like
clockwork
,
it
also
occur
by
the
end
credit
.
meg
ryan
be
a
versatile
actress
-lrb-
look
no
further
than
1998
's
''
hurlyburly
''
or
1994
's
''
when
a
man
love
a
woman
''
-rrb-
,
despite
she
various
detractor
who
stubbornly
believe
all
she
can
do
be
romantic
comedy
.
with
''
hang
up
,
''
the
only
thing
she
need
to
do
be
completely
sever
she
filmmaking
tie
with
nora
ephron
,
a
writer\/director\/hack
who
should
not
be
allow
to
work
in
hollywood
again
after
this
big-budget
,
high-profile
debacle
.
even
if
she
know
what
she
be
make
be
not
exactly
up
to
par
in
the
quality
department
,
she
nonetheless
be
very
good
,
and
the
two
scene
that
work
,
flashback
to
christmas
1988
,
when
she
have
a
heartbreaking
run-in
with
she
mother
,
and
to
halloween
1993
,
when
lou
crash
she
son
's
birthday
party
in
a
drunken
stupor
,
be
effective
because
of
the
realism
ryan
bring
to
the
situation
.
diane
keaton
,
as
georgium
,
be
better
as
a
actress
than
a
director
here
,
but
that
be
a
wildly
feeble
compliment
.
what
be
more
than
a
little
far-fetched
be
that
keaton
be
distinctly
older
than
ryan
and
kudrow
,
although
in
the
very
brief
glimpse
we
get
at
they
as
child
,
she
be
no
more
than
five
year
ryan
's
senior
.
yeah
,
right
.
lastly
,
poor
lisa
kudrow
have
be
waste
once
again
in
a
big-screen
venture
,
after
she
even
more
thin
role
in
1999
's
''
analyze
this
.
''
kudrow
be
not
give
enough
time
to
create
a
full
personality
with
maddy
,
so
it
be
not
she
fault
she
do
not
register
until
a
few
quiet
moment
sprinkle
throughout
where
she
be
actually
bless
with
be
give
dialogue
.
if
anything
,
though
,
kudrow
be
a
real
talent
,
and
i
anxiously
await
the
next
time
she
be
give
a
role
more
deserving
of
she
time
,
as
in
she
brilliantly
nuanced
,
oscar-caliber
work
in
1998
's
''
the
opposite
of
sex
.
''
if
you
be
a
fan
of
kudrow
's
-lrb-
and
who
be
not
?
-rrb-
,
do
yourself
a
favor
and
rent
this
gem
that
put
more
good
use
to
kudrow
in
sixty
seconds
than
''
hang
up
''
do
in
its
entirety
.
as
eve
's
hardwork
husband
,
adam
arkin
be
,
predictably
,
squander
with
a
role
that
give
he
next
to
nothing
to
do
,
until
a
subplot
reveal
itself
midway
through
,
only
to
never
be
mention
again
.
clori
leachman
,
as
with
ryan
and
matthau
,
make
a
small
,
but
noticeable
impression
with
she
,
albeit
,
very
brief
appearance
,
while
edie
mcclurg
,
as
a
rosy-cheeked
woman
lou
have
a
affair
with
in
the
christmas
1988
flashback
,
manage
one
of
the
few
laugh
in
this
otherwise
joyless
production
.
nearly
all
the
emotion
display
within
''
hang
up
''
be
patently
manufacture
,
and
despite
the
movie
want
the
viewer
to
care
about
the
character
,
aside
from
eve
,
why
would
you
want
to
when
they
be
all
spoil
brat
?
if
,
for
some
bizarre
,
''
twilight
zone
''
-
type
of
reason
,
you
find
yourself
in
a
movie
theater
show
this
film
,
my
suggestion
would
be
to
hang
up
on
it
before
the
opening
credit
be
over
.
say
it
be
a
waste
of
time
be
a
understatement
of
epic
proportion
.
