i
have
be
look
forward
to
this
film
since
i
hear
about
it
early
last
year
,
when
matthew
perry
have
just
sign
on
.
i
be
big
fan
of
perry
's
subtle
sense
of
humor
,
and
in
addition
,
i
think
chri
farley
's
on-edge
,
extreme
acting
be
a
riot
.
so
naturally
,
when
the
trailer
for
''
almost
hero
''
hit
theater
,
i
almost
jump
up
and
down
.
a
soda
in
hand
,
the
light
dim
,
i
be
ready
to
be
blow
away
by
farley
's
final
star
role
and
what
be
suppose
to
be
matthew
perry
's
big
breakthrough
.
i
be
ready
to
be
just
amaze
;
for
this
to
be
among
farley
's
best
,
in
spite
of
david
spade
's
absence
.
i
be
ready
to
be
laugh
my
head
off
the
minute
the
credit
run
.
sadly
,
none
of
this
come
to
pass
.
the
humor
be
spotty
at
best
,
with
good
moment
and
laughable
one-liner
few
and
far
between
.
perry
and
farley
have
no
chemistry
;
the
role
that
perry
be
cast
in
seem
obviously
write
for
spade
,
for
it
be
he
type
of
humor
,
and
not
at
all
what
perry
be
associate
with
.
and
the
movie
try
to
be
smart
,
a
subject
best
leave
alone
when
it
be
a
farley
flick
.
the
movie
be
a
major
dissapointment
,
with
only
a
few
scene
worth
a
first
look
,
let
alone
a
second
.
perry
deliver
not
one
humorous
line
the
whole
movie
,
and
not
surprisingly
;
the
only
reason
the
movie
make
the
top
ten
gross
list
opening
week
be
because
it
be
advertise
with
farley
.
and
farley
's
classic
humor
be
widespread
,
too
.
almost
hero
almost
work
,
but
miss
the
wagon-train
by
quite
a
longshot
.
guy
,
let
's
leave
the
explore
to
lewi
and
clark
,
huh
?
stick
to
''
tommy
boy
''
,
and
we
'll
all
be
''
friend
''
.
