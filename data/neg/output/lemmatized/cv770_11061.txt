not
a
bad
set-up
for
a

,
if
only
schlondorff
know
how

material

he
never

tone

the

as
if

wrong
,
it
make
no
sense
that
harry
would
be
stupid
and
dishonest
enough
to
get

up
in
this
scheme
.
harrelson
clearly
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
harry
's
character
,
so
he
spend
most
of
the
film
glowering

sweating

elisabeth

there
be
no
chemistry
between

and
the
woman

to
make
matter
worse
,
schlondorff
badly
dub
in
dialogue
while

the
officer
want
to
help

's
flat
tire

ask

to
open

harry
's
pathetic
attempt
to
keep
the
trunk
close
might
have
work
if
play
as
comedy
,
but
under
schlondorff
's
grim
direction
,
the
scene
be
just
embarrassing
.
the
film
's
nadir
come
when
a
bad
guy
prepare
to
kill
harry
and
nina
.
we
be
suppose
to
be
horrify
watch
we
hero
dangle
over
a
bathtub
fill
with
acid
,
but
by
this
point
the
film
have
founder
so
badly
that
the
scene
be
merely
reminiscent
of
when
jessica
and
roger
rabbit
be
suspend
over

vat
of

have
''

be
play
with
tongue
firmly
in

it
might
have
be
a
entertaining
shaggy
dog
story

but
under
the
harsh
direction
of
schlondorff
,
the
film
be
just
a
sluggish
paint-by-numbers
exercise
in
neo

noir
cluelessness

avoid
this
nonsense
