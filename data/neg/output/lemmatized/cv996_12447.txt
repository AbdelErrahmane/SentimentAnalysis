john
boorman
's
''
zardoz
''
be
a
goofy
cinematic
debacle
so
fundamentally
misconceived
and
laughably
execute
that
it
take
on
a
bizarre
enjoyment
quality
all
its
own
.
not
since
the
rampant
bumbling
of
one
edward
d
.
wood
jr
.
have
a
movie
be
so
silly
and
so
serious
at
the
same
time
.
of
course
,
wood
's
career
can
be
explain
by
two
thing
:
he
have
no
money
and
he
have
no
talent
.
boorman
,
on
the
other
hand
,
can
not
court
such
excuse
to
explain
''
zardoz
''
-lrb-
or
he
follow-up
film
,
the
equally
awful
''
exorcist
ii
:
the
heretic
''
-rrb-
.
boorman
obviously
have
a
sizable
budget
,
a
matinee
idol
movie
star
-lrb-
sean
connery
-rrb-
in
the
lead
role
,
and
although
you
would
not
know
it
from
this
film
,
boorman
do
indeed
have
talent
.
this
be
the
man
who
make
the
slick
modern
masterpiece
''
deliverance
''
-lrb-
1972
-rrb-
,
as
well
as
the
autobiographical
world
war
ii
drama
''
hope
and
glory
''
-lrb-
1987
-rrb-
,
the
slightly
over-conceived
arthurian
epic
''
excalibur
''
-lrb-
1981
-rrb-
and
the
father-son
jungle
adventure
''
the
emerald
forest
''
-lrb-
1985
-rrb-
.
he
film
all
show
that
boorman
be
never
lack
in
imagination
,
but
sometimes
that
come
at
the
cost
of
coherence
and
taste
.
if
boorman
be
anything
,
he
be
ambitious
,
and
when
he
succeed
,
it
be
in
grand
fashion
.
unfortunately
,
the
bigger
they
be
,
the
harder
they
fall
,
and
when
boorman
fall
,
the
resounding
impact
can
be
hear
for
mile
around
.
''
zardoz
''
be
mean
to
take
its
place
among
the
grandest
of
mystical
movie
,
a
obsession
of
boorman
's
.
he
screenplay
try
to
elicit
the
same
mythological
connotation
of
the
arthurian
legend
or
even
''
the
wizard
of
oz
,
''
a
book
which
figure
into
the
movie
's
plot
.
but
,
despite
all
this
reach
,
the
result
movie
be
more
unintentionally
funny
than
intentionally
enigmatical
or
compelling
.
the
event
take
place
in
the
distant
year
2293
,
but
there
be
little
of
the
typical
futuristic
movie-ness
to
be
find
.
in
fact
,
thing
seem
to
have
move
backwards
,
with
people
ride
horse
,
shoot
old-style
gun
,
and
living
in
large
victorian
mansion
.
it
be
more
middle
age
than
space
age
.
the
world
of
''
zardoz
''
be
divide
into
two
distinct
hemisphere
:
the
outland
,
where
all
the
poor
,
pathetic
people
live
,
and
the
vortex
,
where
a
select
group
of
wealthy
intellectual
live
in
comfort
and
everlasting
life
.
these
immortal
never
grow
old
,
they
never
engage
in
sexual
activity
,
they
possess
psychological
power
,
and
they
live
in
a
sort
of
quasi-utopian
marxist
society
where
everyone
be
equal
,
and
everyone
contribute
equally
to
the
society
.
however
,
if
one
break
the
rule
,
that
person
be
punish
by
be
age
so
many
year
.
if
someone
break
the
rule
enough
,
he
or
she
be
age
to
the
point
of
senility
,
and
imprison
to
a
eternal
existence
in
a
geriatric
home
with
other
aged
criminal
.
one
of
the
immortal
,
arthur
frayn
-lrb-
niall
buggy
-rrb-
,
a
squirmy
man
with
a
mustache
and
goatee
tattoo
on
he
face
,
be
charge
with
keep
order
in
the
outland
and
force
the
resident
to
farm
so
the
immortal
can
be
feed
.
like
''
the
wizard
of
oz
,
''
he
adopt
a
god-like
status
among
the
people
by
fly
in
to
they
part
of
the
world
in
a
giant
stone
carve
like
a
menacing
head
.
-lrb-
this
fly
head
be
one
of
the
movie
's
opening
image
,
and
it
be
a
dead
giveaway
of
the
lunacy
to
come
.
-rrb-
call
himself
zardoz
,
frayn
gather
a
bunch
of
outlander
and
make
they
into
a
group
call
the
exterminator
,
whose
purpose
be
to
kill
most
of
the
other
outlander
so
they
can
not
procreate
and
take
up
more
resource
.
from
inside
he
giant
,
stone
head
,
zardoz
bellows
seriously
laugh-induct
statement
like
,
''
the
gun
be
good
.
the
penis
be
evil
.
''
that
line
alone
be
worth
the
movie
's
cult
follow
.
one
day
,
a
exterminator
name
zed
-lrb-
sean
connery
-rrb-
,
sneak
into
zardoz
's
fly
stone
,
push
frayn
out
,
and
go
back
to
the
vortex
.
once
there
,
the
immortal
label
he
a
''
brutal
''
and
study
he
like
a
lab
rat
,
take
great
,
perverse
care
in
explore
he
sexuality
,
which
be
a
mystery
to
they
.
they
seem
especially
interested
in
he
ability
to
gain
a
erection
,
and
there
be
one
downright
hilarious
sequence
where
a
bunch
of
scantily-clad
female
scientist
show
zed
erotic
footage
on
a
video
screen
in
a
attempt
to
determine
what
get
he
work
up
.
i
say
''
hilarious
''
because
that
be
exactly
what
''
zardoz
''
be
.
it
be
obvious
that
boorman
do
not
intend
it
to
be
so
;
he
make
this
film
with
the
straightest
of
face
,
although
i
have
a
hard
time
believe
that
as
production
move
forward
,
he
do
not
get
even
the
slightest
inkling
of
how
patently
ridiculous
it
be
become
.
just
look
at
connery
be
enough
to
give
one
the
giggle
-
he
spend
most
of
the
film
run
around
in
a
red
loin
cloth
that
resemble
a
diaper
,
a
mane
of
hair
braided
halfway
down
he
back
,
a
wyatt
earp-style
handlebar
mustache
,
and
a
pair
of
thigh-high
patent
leather
boot
that
would
look
more
appropriate
on
a
cheap
hollywood
hooker
.
boorman
make
the
film
right
after
the
critical
and
financial
success
of
''
deliverance
,
''
which
be
the
only
reason
i
can
imagine
a
studio
would
green-light
this
effort
.
he
attract
some
rich
talent
on
both
side
of
the
camera
,
include
cinematographer
geoffrey
unsworth
-lrb-
''
2001
''
-rrb-
,
whose
striking
visual
be
about
the
only
good
thing
in
''
zardoz
''
besides
the
inadvertent
humor
.
sean
connery
have
make
he
last
jame
bond
film
in
1971
,
and
perhaps
he
be
look
for
a
change
in
pace
.
he
get
exactly
that
in
''
zardoz
,
''
and
it
be
a
wonder
it
do
not
end
he
career
.
i
be
sure
boorman
intend
for
this
movie
to
make
some
grand
statement
.
be
it
a
treatise
about
the
infallibility
of
eternal
life
?
be
it
a
condemnation
of
those
who
consider
grow
old
to
be
a
bad
thing
?
or
be
it
a
social
statement
,
something
about
the
inherent
negativity
of
class
distinction
and
the
violence
it
create
?
karl
marx
might
like
it
if
he
be
more
like
timothy
leary
.
come
to
think
of
it
,
maybe
boorman
make
it
as
a
extended
lsd
trip
.
people
high
on
illicit
substance
be
the
only
one
i
can
imagine
enjoy
this
asinine
silliness
as
anything
more
than
a
completely
unintentional
comedy
.
