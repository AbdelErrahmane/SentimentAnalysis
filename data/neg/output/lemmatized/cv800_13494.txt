there
be
four
movie
that
earn
jamie
lee
curti
the
title
of
''
scream
queen
''
in
the
early
'80
.
two
of
they
be
halloween
movie
,
but
the
other
two
--
prom
night
and
terror
train
--
be
the
uninspired
knockoff
that
come
directly
after
the
success
of
halloween
.
the
same
''
god
,
i
be
scared
,
there
be
some
guy
in
a
mask
come
after
I

routine
she
do
in
john
carpenter
's
classic
,
jamie
lee
copy
here
,
with
none
of
the
urgency
or
suspense
.
terror
train
take
place
on
-lrb-
where
else
?
-rrb-
a
train
,
chart
by
some
pre-med
student
finish
they
first
four
year
of
higher
education
.
most
of
they
will
not
make
it
to
med
school
,
though
,
and
it
be
obvious
from
the
foreshadowing
do
when
the
conductor
complain
,
''
i
wish
to
hell
they
would
put
a
radio
on
that
train
.
''
the
conductor
character
probably
have
the
most
line
of
anyone
,
even
jamie
lee
.
from
the
beginning
,
he
be
talk
he
head
off
-lrb-
he
tell
one
of
he
co-worker
''
think
on
this
--
when
's
the
last
time
someone
build
a
shopping
mall
next
to
a
train
station
?
''
as
if
it
make
any
kind
of
sense
-rrb-
and
it
only
get
better
as
he
engage
himself
in
a
argument
about
the
benefit
of
railroad
over
recreational
vehicle
.
of
course
,
the
loudmouth
conductor
be
the
first
person
to
find
a
bloody
body
,
which
be
then
go
when
he
bring
a
skeptical
trainman
back
to
view
it
.
i
forget
to
mention
the
prologue
.
it
be
a
party
three
year
earlier
,
with
the
same
group
of
student
.
two
of
they
play
a
trick
on
a
geeky
frat
pledge
,
promise
he
he
be
go
to
get
lay
.
they
send
jamie
lee
up
to
stand
behind
the
bed
and
talk
to
the
geek
as
he
come
in
,
notice
a
form
on
the
bed
.
she
say
,
''
kiss
I
,
kenny
,
''
and
he
kiss
the
body
on
the
bed
,
which
happen
to
be
a
cadaver
.
-lrb-
''
oh
my
god
,
they
kill
kenny
!
you
bastard
!
''
-rrb-
it
be
a
sick
trick
,
and
one
jamie
lee
be
not
let
in
on
.
she
still
have
not
forgive
the
guy
as
they
board
the
terror
train
-lrb-
''
you
asshole
,
you
can
not
have
a
good
time
without
hurt
somebody
!
''
-rrb-
.
the
killing
start
before
the
train
even
leave
the
station
.
since
it
be
new
year
's
,
everyone
's
wear
disguise
-lrb-
a
convenient
plot
device
we
have
see
before
-rrb-
,
and
someone
stab
the
guy
in
the
groucho
mask
when
no
one
's
look
.
at
least
one
of
the
character
say
it
be
a
groucho
mask
;
when
the
killer
don
it
and
step
aboard
,
it
look
like
gene
shalit
who
,
by
the
way
,
would
make
a
great
killer
in
a
slasher
movie
.
speaking
of
weird-looking
dork
who
still
persist
on
the
entertainment
scene
,
one
of
terror
train
's
most
famous
gimmick
be
the
appearance
of
david
copperfield
''
as
the
magician
,
''
who
regail
those
aboard
with
illusion
set
to
disco
music
.
then
there
be
he
greatest
trick
--
get
lay
with
hair
that
look
like
that
.
for
all
its
attempt
at
visual
style
and
substance
,
terror
train
be
more
lionel
than
amtrak
,
more
prom
night
than
halloween
,
and
nothing
really
worth
watch
.
only
die-hard
fan
of
jamie
lee
curti
and
david
copperfield
-lrb-
if
he
truly
have
any
fan
-rrb-
should
even
attempt
to
watch
it
.
and
it
make
I
wonder
if
a
horror
movie
set
in
a
rv
could
be
much
worse
.
i
mean
,
when
be
the
last
time
someone
build
a
shopping
mall
next
to
a
train
station
,
anyway
?
terror
train
be
definitely
the
cinematic
equivalent
of
a
sleeper
car
.
