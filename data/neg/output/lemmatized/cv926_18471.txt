atcheson
a
fellow
critic
once
state
he
belief
that
a
reviewer
should
not
speak
of
himself
in
he
own
review
.
i
have
attempt
to
obey
this
rule
in
recent
month
,
but
to
do
so
would
be
impossible
in
this
case
.
the
fact
be
,
nearly
every
person
who
go
to
see
the
phantom
menace
bring
baggage
in
with
they
.
the
original
star
war
trilogy
mean
so
much
to
so
many
people
.
for
I
,
they
calibrate
my
creativity
as
a
child
;
they
be
masterful
,
original
work
of
art
that
mix
move
story
with
what
be
astonishing
special
effect
at
the
time
-lrb-
and
they
still
hold
up
pretty
darn
well
-rrb-
.
i
be
too
young
to
have
see
star
war
in
the
theater
during
its
original
release
,
but
that
do
not
make
I
any
less
dedicate
to
it
.
on
the
contrary
,
the
star
war
trilogy
--
and
the
empire
strike
back
in
particular
--
be
three
item
on
a
very
short
list
of
why
i
love
movie
.
when
i
hear
that
george
luca
would
be
make
the
first
trilogy
in
the
nine-film
series
,
i
get
exit
.
when
i
first
saw
screenshot
from
the
film
,
well
over
a
year
ago
,
i
embark
on
a
year-long
drool
of
anticipation
.
and
when
the
first
preview
be
release
last
thanksgiving
,
i
be
ready
to
see
the
film
.
but
then
there
be
the
hype
,
the
insane
marketing
campaign
,
and
lucasfilm
's
secretive
snobbery
over
the
picture
.
in
the
last
week
before
the
picture
open
,
while
multitude
of
fan
wait
outside
of
theater
and
stand
in
the
boiling
sun
day
in
advance
just
to
be
the
first
one
in
the
theater
,
i
be
tire
of
hear
about
it
.
i
be
tire
of
see
cardboard
cut-out
of
the
character
whenever
i
go
to
kfc
or
taco
bell
.
i
just
want
to
see
the
movie
.
reader
,
do
not
misunderstand
.
i
do
not
have
a
anti-hype
reaction
.
the
hype
be
unavoidable
.
i
understand
and
accept
the
hype
--
it
be
just
what
happen
when
the
prequel
to
the
most
widely
beloved
film
of
all
time
get
release
.
five
minute
into
the
phantom
menace
,
i
know
there
be
a
problem
.
''
who
be
these
jedus
knight
?
''
i
ask
.
''
why
be
they
churn
out
stale
dialogue
with
machine-gun
rapidity
?
''
''
why
be
not
these
character
be
develop
before
they
adventure
?
''
''
why
be
there
a
special
effect
shoot
in
nearly
every
frame
of
the
entire
film
?
''
these
be
just
some
of
my
question
early
on
.
later
,
i
ask
,
''
where
's
the
magic
of
the
first
three
film
?
''
and
''
why
be
i
look
at
my
watch
every
fifteen
minute
?
'
by
the
end
of
the
film
,
i
be
tire
,
madden
,
and
depress
.
george
luca
have
funnel
he
own
wonderful
movie
into
a
pointless
,
mindless
,
summer
blockbuster
.
the
phantom
menace
be
no
star
war
film
.
take
away
the
title
and
the
jedus
talk
and
the
force
,
and
you
be
leave
with
what
be
easily
one
of
the
most
vacuous
special
effect
movie
of
all
time
.
it
be
a
embarrassment
.
i
look
desperately
for
a
scene
in
which
a
character
be
explore
,
or
a
new
theme
be
examine
,
or
a
special
effect
shoot
be
not
use
.
there
be
a
few
of
each
,
but
they
be
all
token
attempt
.
the
fact
be
,
george
luca
have
create
what
be
simultaneously
a
abysmally
bad
excuse
for
a
movie
and
a
pretty
good
showcase
for
digital
effect
.
this
be
not
what
i
want
to
see
.
i
do
not
want
to
leave
the
phantom
menace
with
a
headache
and
a
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
,
but
i
do
.
the
story
center
mostly
around
qui-gon
jinn
-lrb-
liam
neeson
,
look
lose
and
confuse
-rrb-
and
he
apprentice
,
obi-wan
kenobus
-lrb-
ewan
mcgregor
,
who
scarcely
have
a
line
in
the
film
-rrb-
and
they
attempt
to
liberate
the
people
of
the
planet
naboo
.
naboo
be
the
victim
of
a
bureaucratic
war
with
the
trade
federation
;
they
contact
on
naboo
be
queen
amidalum
-lrb-
natalie
portman
-rrb-
,
the
teenage
ruler
who
truly
care
for
she
people
.
after
pick
up
jar
jar
bink
-lrb-
a
completely
cgi
character
,
voice
by
ahm
best
-rrb-
,
they
head
to
tatooine
,
where
they
meet
young
anakin
skywalker
-lrb-
jake
lloyd
-rrb-
and
he
mother
-lrb-
pernilla
August
-rrb-
.
qui-gon
know
that
the
force
be
strong
with
young
anakin
,
and
so
the
jedus
knight
take
the
boy
with
they
on
they
journey
.
the
bad
guy
be
darth
maul
and
darth
sidious
,
neither
of
whom
have
enough
line
to
register
as
character
.
there
be
not
anything
particularly
wrong
with
this
story
when
look
at
it
in
synopsis
form
.
the
way
luca
have
handle
it
,
however
,
it
unsatisfactory
.
first
of
all
,
we
do
not
learn
one
single
thing
about
qui-gon
jinn
.
not
one
thing
.
what
be
he
life
like
before
this
film
?
well
,
i
imagine
he
do
not
have
one
.
that
be
why
he
feel
like
a
plot
device
.
this
probably
explain
why
neeson
look
so
hopeless
in
the
role
,
and
why
he
be
recently
retire
from
film
-lrb-
i
do
not
blame
he
,
honestly
-rrb-
.
obi-wan
,
a
character
i
be
really
look
forward
to
learn
more
about
,
be
even
less
interesting
.
mcgregor
have
just
a
few
line
,
so
anyone
hope
to
see
the
engaging
young
actor
in
a
great
performance
be
urge
to
look
elsewhere
.
since
these
two
man
be
the
focus
of
the
phantom
menace
,
luca
have
serve
we
a
big
emotional
void
as
the
centerpiece
of
he
movie
.
thing
start
to
pick
up
when
we
character
reach
tatooine
;
young
anakin
be
perhaps
the
only
truly
fleshed-out
character
in
the
film
,
and
lloyd
do
a
thoughtful
job
with
the
role
.
i
be
also
hugely
impressed
with
the
sand
speeder
scene
;
rarely
be
a
action
sequence
so
fast
and
so
exciting
.
and
when
anakin
say
goodbye
to
he
mother
,
i
find
it
move
.
also
fairly
good
be
portman
,
and
she
manage
to
give
a
little
depth
to
a
character
where
no
depth
have
be
write
.
jar
jar
bink
be
one
of
the
most
annoying
character
i
have
ever
have
to
endure
,
but
he
be
more
interesting
than
most
of
the
human
.
as
soon
as
the
relatively-brief
segment
on
tatooine
be
over
,
it
be
back
to
the
mind-numbing
special
effect
and
depthless
action
scene
.
i
have
see
many
movie
that
qualify
as
''
special
effect
extravaganza
,
''
but
the
phantom
menace
be
the
first
one
i
have
see
that
have
I
sick
of
the
special
effect
fifteen
minute
into
the
movie
.
the
reason
be
obvious
:
george
luca
have
no
restraint
.
i
can
not
say
that
i
do
not
find
the
effect
original
,
because
i
do
--
the
final
battle
between
darth
maul
,
obi-wan
,
and
qui-gon
be
visually
exceptional
,
as
be
most
of
the
film
.
but
i
also
find
the
effect
deadening
and
tiresome
.
my
breaking
point
be
near
the
end
of
the
picture
,
as
anakin
be
get
question
by
yoda
and
the
other
jedus
master
;
in
the
background
,
we
see
hundred
of
digital
spaceship
fly
around
through
a
digital
sky
,
and
i
want
that
to
go
away
.
can
not
we
have
one
stinking
scene
that
be
not
burst
at
the
seem
with
a
special
effect
shoot
?
i
get
so
sick
of
look
at
the
cgus
character
and
spaceship
and
planet
and
background
that
i
really
just
want
to
go
outside
and
look
at
a
physical
landscape
for
a
few
hour
.
and
then
there
be
the
question
of
magic
.
what
be
lose
in
the
sixteen
year
between
the
phantom
menace
and
return
of
the
jedus
?
i
have
a
feeling
that
luca
be
so
focus
on
how
he
movie
look
that
he
forget
entirely
the
way
it
should
feel
.
john
william
'
familiar
score
be
no
help
,
nor
be
luca
'
direction
.
i
think
it
come
right
down
to
character
:
there
be
none
here
.
i
long
for
the
magnetic
presence
of
han
,
luke
,
and
leium
,
but
i
get
no
such
thing
.
and
what
about
the
ridiculous
expectation
?
mine
be
not
that
high
;
i
simply
want
a
film
that
show
I
the
root
of
the
film
that
i
grow
up
loving
,
a
story
that
have
a
few
character
and
a
few
great
special
effect
.
instead
,
i
get
two
hour
and
fifteen
minute
of
a
lifeless
and
imaginative
computer
graphic
show
.
i
do
not
hate
the
phantom
menace
as
much
as
i
resent
it
:
i
would
like
to
forget
that
it
exist
,
and
yet
i
can
not
.
it
be
here
to
stay
.
i
can
only
hope
that
episode
ii
and
iii
have
something
of
substance
in
they
,
because
if
they
do
not
,
then
luca
will
have
pull
off
the
impossible
task
of
destroy
he
own
indestructible
series
.
