''
idle
hand
''
be
distasteful
,
crass
and
derivative
.
if
a
original
thought
find
its
way
into
this
horror-comedy
it
would
die
of
loneliness
.
plus
,
you
have
to
question
the
judgment
and
sensitivity
of
studio
executive
who
would
green
light
the
release
of
a
movie
deal
with
the
slaughter
of
innocent
teen-ager
the
week
after
the
tragedy
in
littleton
,
colo
.
the
movie
be
insulting
to
horror
film
fan
and
teen-ager
.
the
plot
,
what
little
there
be
,
deal
with
anton
-lrb-
devon
sawa
-rrb-
,
a
high-school
slacker
who
be
hand
go
on
a
murderous
rampage
after
become
possess
.
along
the
way
the
hand
kill
anton
's
parent
and
he
two
best
friend
.
the
friend
,
also
slacker
,
be
so
lazy
that
they
return
from
the
dead
because
the
walk
into
the
light
be
too
far
for
they
.
that
be
the
level
of
this
be
atrocity
's
humor
.
the
movie
treat
death
as
a
joke
.
''
idle
hand
''
be
gruesome
and
morbid
.
the
performance
be
stereotypical
and
cartoonish
.
i
realize
this
be
suppose
to
pass
for
comedy
,
but
recent
event
have
surpass
what
be
on
the
screen
.
it
be
not
the
fault
of
the
filmmaker
that
real
life
have
overtake
reel
life
.
and
i
can
only
presume
that
the
writer
of
''
idle
hand
,
''
terrus
hughe
and
ron
milbauer
,
be
try
to
make
some
statement
about
today
's
young
people
and
they
value
in
a
satiric
vein
.
however
,
it
be
hard
to
laugh
at
death
these
day
,
especially
one
involve
young
people
.
with
the
real
horror
of
the
world
put
before
we
on
television
,
a
stale
pastry
such
as
''
idle
hand
''
should
be
hold
from
release
for
a
few
week
or
month
to
give
we
time
to
catch
we
collective
breath
.
''
idle
hand
''
be
bad
,
no
matter
the
circumstance
in
the
world
outside
.
but
the
context
of
recent
event
only
heighten
its
shortcoming
.
the
time
be
not
right
for
this
type
of
movie
.
and
as
far
as
''
idle
hand
''
go
,
the
time
may
never
be
right
.
this
be
a
movie
that
shoud
be
consign
to
the
trash
bin
of
cinema
.
