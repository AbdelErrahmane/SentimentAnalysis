word
i
think
i
would
never
write
:
the
sequel
to
urban
legend
lack
the
grace
,
wit
,
and
power
of
the
original
.
put
the
gun
to
my
head
,
pull
the
trigger
,
and
put
I
out
of
my
misery
.
better
yet
,
put
the
horror
genre
out
of
its
misery
.
when
you
have
finish
watch
urban
legend
:
final
cut
,
you
'll
share
my
same
grim
point
of
view
thanks
to
the
horrible
acting
,
terrible
script
,
and
ridiculous
directing
which
have
become
all
too
common
today
.
urban
legend
:
final
cut
be
a
smorgasbord
of
steal
movie
idea
-lrb-
mainly
from
the
blair
witch
project
and
scream
-rrb-
:
fabulous
people
with
perfect
tooth
and
skin
,
one
creepy
film
school
,
and
a
dog
eat
a
freshly
remove
kidney
from
one
of
the
movie
's
hapless
victim
.
urban
legend
deliver
a
story
about
a
bunch
of
film
student
work
on
they
thesis
film
to
win
the
coveted
''
hitchcock
award
''
which
guarantee
the
winner
a
director
deal
in
hollywood
.
one
female
filmmaker
-lrb-
jennifer
morrison
,
the
freaky
dead
girl
from
stir
of
echo
-rrb-
write
a
fiction
script
base
on
a
serial
killer
who
kill
he
victim
accord
to
''
urban
legend
''
tale
.
suddenly
,
she
entire
crew
start
get
bump
off
with
urban-legendary
homicide
,
but
the
body
be
always
miss
and
she
be
often
the
only
witness
to
the
killing
.
the
killer
wear
a
fencing
mask
and
a
long
black
overcoat
,
look
like
a
scorned
olympian
out
to
avenge
he
defeat
in
sydney
.
why
this
be
scary
be
never
explain
.
of
course
,
the
golden
rule
of
sequel
be
that
there
must
be
least
one
recur
character
for
continuity
's
sake
.
urban
legend
have
one
minor
,
recur
character
from
the
original
who
we
never
care
about
anyway
-lrb-
the
security
guard
,
of
all
people
-rrb-
.
the
other
central
problem
be
that
this
character
have
already
see
the
urban
legend
killing
once
before
,
but
she
be
utterly
clueless
about
what
be
go
on
around
she
.
call
it
suspension
of
disbelief
.
this
film
be
also
a
prime
example
of
how
horror
film
be
now
completely
dead
in
the
water
.
the
last
decent
horror
film
be
the
blair
witch
project
,
and
that
seem
more
like
a
snuff
film
than
fiction
.
the
stalk
killer
with
crazy
motivation
have
become
a
tired
clich
?
,
as
everyone
seem
to
have
forget
:
real
horror
be
not
about
what
be
see
but
about
what
be
unknown
.
