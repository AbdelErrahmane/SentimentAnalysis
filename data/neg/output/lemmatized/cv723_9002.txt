chri
tucker
be
one
of
those
guy
you
immediately
get
a
reaction
from
--
you
either
find
he
helium
voice
,
crazy
eye
and
jerky
mannerism
funny
or
annoying
.
i
think
i
fall
into
the
former
category
-lrb-
i
be
one
of
the
few
who
think
he
turn
in
''
the
fifth
element
''
as
a
prance
,
prince-like
deejay
be
complete
inspired
lunacy
and
not
the
least
bit
aggravating
-rrb-
,
but
he
new
vehicle
''
money
talk
''
just
do
not
do
he
service
.
tucker
be
good
in
the
movie
--
and
this
be
the
kind
of
film
that
,
if
people
see
it
,
could
make
he
a
big
star
--
but
he
be
also
really
the
only
thing
good
about
the
movie
.
in
fact
,
if
you
see
''
money
talk
,
''
it
should
shock
you
beyond
recognition
that
two
of
''
toy
story
''
's
writer
pen
the
sloppy
script
.
tucker
's
role
here
be
that
of
franklin
hatchett
,
a
petty
lo
angele
con
artist
whose
carwash
scam
get
he
dog
by
investigative
reporter
jame
russell
-lrb-
charlie
sheen
-rrb-
.
after
be
bust
on
the
job
for
some
illegal
business
involve
counterfeit
passport
,
franklin
find
himself
on
a
bus
to
the
county
jail
and
handcuff
to
slick
international
jewel
smuggler
raymond
villard
-lrb-
gerard
ismael
-rrb-
.
but
villard
's
thug
blow
up
the
bus
in
a
attempt
to
free
they
leader
-lrb-
never
mind
that
the
explosion
could
have
instead
kill
he
-rrb-
,
and
because
he
and
franklin
be
join
at
the
wrist
,
franklin
be
allow
to
escape
as
well
,
but
not
before
overhear
some
important
information
regard
a
diamond
stash
that
--
for
some
reason
or
another
--
be
be
hide
in
a
vintage
roadster
wait
to
be
auction
off
at
a
upcoming
auto
expo
.
the
local
media
mistakenly
put
the
prison
break-out
blame
on
franklin
,
which
be
where
jame
come
back
into
the
picture
.
he
make
a
deal
to
protect
franklin
if
,
in
turn
,
franklin
give
he
a
exclusive
interview
.
this
mean
jame
must
present
he
new
''
friend
''
in
the
stickiest
of
situation
--
a
formal
dinner
party
for
he
and
fiancee
grace
-lrb-
heather
locklear
-rrb-
,
also
attend
by
she
uber-rich
parent
-lrb-
veronica
cartwright
and
nicely
game
paul
sorvino
-rrb-
.
and
of
course
the
bad
guy
track
franklin
down
and
try
to
knock
he
off
,
all
the
while
he
spar
and
form
a
unlikely
bond
with
jame
.
''
this
be
not
no
buddy
movie
,
''
claim
the
print
ad
.
yeah
,
right
.
actually
,
for
the
better
part
of
,
oh
,
20
minute
,
it
appear
''
money
talk
''
have
the
momentum
to
cover
entertaining
ground
,
and
this
be
mostly
due
to
the
presence
of
spastic
motormouth
tucker
.
this
be
tucker
's
first
lead
role
,
and
if
you
imagine
a
slightly
lankier
,
african-american
jim
carrey
with
a
reliance
on
wild
r-rated
raunch
rather
than
pg-13
physical
comedy
,
you
have
a
good
idea
of
the
conviction
with
which
he
assault
the
role
.
but
you
realize
all
too
quickly
that
tucker
's
overstate
liveliness
be
the
only
thing
''
money
talk
''
have
go
for
it
.
and
a
lively
actor
alone
do
not
a
successful
movie
make
.
it
be
all
too
easy
to
pick
out
everything
wrong
with
''
money
talk
.
''
the
plot
be
recycled
buddy-buddy
comedy-thriller
tripe
that
seem
overuse
even
when
''
nothing
to
lose
''
employ
it
last
month
.
everything
be
paint-by-numbers
,
especially
the
lo
angele
coliseum
finale
,
which
find
not
one
,
not
two
,
but
three
separate
enemy
faction
firing
at
franklin
as
they
pursue
he
through
the
bleacher
.
the
villain
,
as
many
as
there
be
,
be
dull
.
certain
story
element
be
too
coincidental
.
and
too
much
of
the
film
's
dramatic
agenda
be
play
too
straight
.
a
scene
where
grace
confront
jame
after
learn
franklin
's
true
identity
-lrb-
''
you
bring
a
killer
into
my
parent
'
house
!
''
-rrb-
be
extremely
silly
.
you
get
the
picture
.
obviously
,
i
do
not
have
a
pleasant
experience
at
''
money
talk
.
''
but
the
people
around
I
appear
to
be
have
a
rip-roaring
good
time
-lrb-
one
gentleman
several
row
behind
I
chortle
with
such
expressive
conviction
i
begin
fear
for
he
health
-rrb-
.
but
tucker
,
at
least
for
I
,
be
a
pretty
funny
guy
,
and
ace
the
movie
's
best
scene
,
where
franklin
pass
himself
off
as
vic
damone
's
son
at
jame
and
grace
's
engagement
bash
and
toast
the
couple
with
barry
white
lyric
.
tucker
's
audience
--
and
he
do
have
one
--
will
probably
like
''
money
talk
.
''
those
who
he
irritate
,
however
,
will
have
a
more
productive
day
stay
home
and
scrape
the
gook
out
from
under
they
toenail
.
