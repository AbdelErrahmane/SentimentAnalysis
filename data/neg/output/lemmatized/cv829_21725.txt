i
have
a
epiphany
today
.
it
occur
to
I
while
i
be
watch
''
house
on
haunt
hill
.
''
it
be
as
follow
:
if
a
trailer
make
the
film
it
be
advertising
look
like
a
trashy
,
stupid
movie
,
well
guess
what
?
chance
be
,
there
\*
be
\*
truth
in
advertising
.
too
bad
i
do
not
trust
my
own
instinct
when
something-or-the-other
possess
I
to
see
this
movie
.
i
blame
it
on
my
sudden
craving
for
a
scare
and
my
anticipation
of
''
sleepy
hollow
.
''
that
and
''
dogma
''
start
too
late
in
the
afternoon
for
my
schedule
.
a
hour
of
''
angel
''
or
''
buffy
''
be
scarier
than
this
doozy
that
try
to
be
scary
and
shtick
but
fall
flat
on
its
face
.
i
wish
i
would
see
it
when
it
be
halloween
.
at
least
i
would
have
be
forgiving
.
hey
,
ti
the
season
.
the
movie
be
scary
-lrb-
albeit
very
confusing
,
dizzying
,
and
nauseating
-rrb-
at
first
,
but
soon
the
horror
get
repetitive
and
downright
laughable
because
the
film
obviously
be
not
go
anywhere
.
now
i
truly
appreciate
film
like
''
scream
,
''
''
halloween
,
''
or
any
old
hitchcock
film
where
the
scariness
stem
from
situation
that
be
at
least
somewhat
realistic
.
that
be
what
spook
people
out
,
the
fact
that
it
could
happen
to
they
or
someone
they
know
.
there
have
to
be
a
logical
precedent
for
the
situation
they
want
to
scare
we
with
.
sure
,
utterly
unpredictable
be
good
,
too
,
but
that
be
different
from
utterly
nonsensical
.
hohh
-lrb-
house
on
haunt
hill
-rrb-
,
on
the
other
hand
.
.
.
well
let
's
just
say
i
about
fall
off
my
chair
laugh
when
they
oh-so-cleverly
reveal
that
everyone
who
get
invite
to
the
party
be
relate
to
the
psycho
doctor
who
die
in
the
house
a
couple
of
decade
ago
.
riiiiight
.
y'
know
,
that
just
send
chill
down
my
spine
.
yeah
.
just
like
i
wet
my
pants
when
they
tell
I
the
house
be
evil
.
ooooooo
.
hint
:
blood
and
gut
only
work
a
few
time
.
sooner
or
later
people
start
to
tell
themselves
that
it
be
just
ketchup
and
prop
and
you
have
get
to
come
up
with
something
better
than
that
.
there
be
just
too
many
thing
in
this
movie
that
we
have
all
see
before
;
from
the
inevitable
''
plot
development
''
of
stranger
unwittingly
trap
together
;
stranger
turn
against
each
other
;
the
evil
manifest
itself
;
the
dead
come
back
for
a
last
scare
.
each
be
more
predictable
than
the
last
.
why
do
not
these
fool
just
stay
together
in
one
place
anyways
?
sheesh
.
be
i
gross
out
?
yes
.
do
i
get
spook
a
few
time
?
yes
.
but
why
?
i
get
really
disturb
when
there
be
no
why
.
when
there
be
not
random
scare
that
be
there
for
no
other
reason
than
for
the
visual
effect
-lrb-
which
be
not
that
good
either
,
trust
I
-rrb-
and
the
scare
,
the
film
be
fill
with
drab
,
laughable
dialogue
.
the
character
be
incredibly
flat
and
cliched
.
not
to
mention
downright
annoying
.
you
have
get
a
bunch
of
people
go
nowhere
in
they
life
;
of
course
they
be
dumb
enough
to
go
to
a
party
some
stranger
invite
they
to
provide
they
win
a
million
dollar
if
they
survive
the
night
.
jeez
,
i
think
no
one
fall
for
those
''
you
may
already
be
a
winner
''
thing
anymore
.
and
of
course
,
all
three
gal
be
babe
.
i
wonder
how
on
earth
the
geoffrey
rush
of
''
shine
''
end
up
in
this
movie
.
keep
that
up
,
geoff
,
and
you
'll
qualify
for
the
next
batman
venture
.
the
only
single
person
i
enjoy
be
chris
kattan
because
,
well
,
he
just
crack
I
up
.
and
famke
jansen
-lrb-
sp
?
-rrb-
because
she
remind
I
of
the
delectable
brosnan
.
pierce
brosnan
-lrb-
hey
,
i
willingly
endure
''
dante
's
peak
''
three
time
for
he
:
-rrb-
.
all
right
,
i
concede
.
there
be
a
couple
of
thing
i
enjoy
.
that
perverted
little
amusement
park
at
the
beginning
.
i
probably
will
not
ride
a
rollercoaster
for
a
while
.
and
the
machine
they
use
to
drive
geoffrey
's
character
mad
-lrb-
see
,
i
do
not
even
remember
they
name
-rrb-
.
the
machine
,
not
that
stupid
fishtank
with
naked
wimmin
in
it
.
i
keep
wait
and
wait
for
that
inevitable
twist
at
the
end
of
the
movie
.
it
would
not
have
redeem
the
film
,
but
at
least
it
would
have
make
I
feel
better
.
but
no
,
they
opt
for
the
beautiful
sunrise
end
.
thank
god
they
do
not
add
a
kiss
at
the
end
or
i
would
have
puke
.
god
,
there
be
no
hope
.
