jet
li
bust
onto
the
american
action
movie
scene
,
when
he
steal
the
show
in
1998
's
lethal
weapon
4
,
with
he
wicked
look
,
he
nasty
move
and
he
undeniable
charisma
.
it
only
take
another
two
year
for
mega-producer
joel
silver
to
set
he
up
in
a
all-american
movie
,
prime
to
take
over
some
of
the
empty
action-hero
seat
leave
by
alleged
coke-head
van
damme
and
that
pudgy
guy
name
steven
seagal
.
would
this
film
take
li
past
he
rival
asian
action
counterpart
,
namely
chow
yun-fat
and
jackie
chan
?
let
's
find
out
.
plot
:
rival
chinese
and
black
gangster
organization
fall
further
out
of
favor
from
one
another
,
when
member
of
they
respective
family
start
turn
up
dead
.
that
be
when
badass
jet
li
blast
into
the
picture
to
find
out
who
the
man
be
behind
he
brother
's
death
and
to
exact
some
of
he
own
style
of
revenge
.
critique
:
three
word
:
not
enough
action
!
simple
enough
?
not
enough
hong
kong
kickass
jet
li
action
to
compensate
for
a
horribly
predictable
screenplay
,
bad
actor
,
crappy
dialogue
and
oh-so
many
over-the-top
melodramatic
moment
.
and
a
romance
angle
?
why
,
one
must
ask
...
why
?
i
love
fight
scene
and
i
really
dig
jet
li
too
,
but
this
little
ditty
barely
contain
three
memorable
action
sequence
,
and
jet
,
well
,
the
poor
dude
be
barely
in
the
movie
.
and
i
think
this
be
suppose
to
be
he
big
break
?
how
`
bout
give
the
slickster
some
more
opportunity
to
show
we
he
kung-fu
fight
chop
,
slap
he
in
a
few
more
scene
,
and
give
he
more
chance
to
practice
he
acting\/english
ability
?
what
a
letdown
.
even
black
mask
be
more
entertaining
than
this
gloss
up
,
empty
shell
of
a
film
.
in
fact
,
i
be
sure
that
more
time
be
spend
gather
the
''
hit
''
for
the
soundtrack
of
this
film
,
than
be
on
the
so-called
''
screenplay
''
.
i
feel
like
i
be
watch
a
soundtrack
rather
than
a
movie
most
of
the
time
.
the
sad
part
about
the
bad
script
be
that
it
would
not
matter
so
much
if
the
film
actually
have
some
decent
actor
spout
out
the
tacky
line
.
but
no
,
save
lindo
and
aaliyah
,
who
be
not
too
shabby
,
i
think
the
rest
of
the
cast
be
pick
primarily
from
they
inability
to
deliver
line
convincingly
.
and
what
be
the
deal
with
the
whole
nfl
franchise
deal
run
by
some
15-year
old
look
guy
,
act
like
he
be
the
overlord
of
a
drug
ring
?
!
what
a
mess
.
then
again
,
i
do
not
want
it
to
seem
like
i
be
complain
solely
about
the
story
which
be
completely
foreseeable
,
since
we
all
go
to
see
these
movie
for
the
action
anyway
,
not
the
story
.
well
,
i
guess
that
be
what
disappoint
I
the
most
out
of
this
film
.
there
be
a
couple
of
cool
fight
scene
with
li
,
but
simply
not
enough
to
satisfy
my
overall
craving
.
also
,
as
much
as
i
love
the
way
they
incorporate
wire
and
special
effect
in
some
of
they
stunt
,
a
couple
of
the
exaggerated
fight
scene
be
simply
too
obvious
a
stunt
.
it
should
be
seamless
,
fella
,
not
necessarily
against
the
law
of
gravity
!
the
one
cool
thing
that
be
original
in
the
movie
be
the
way
in
which
the
director
show
we
some
of
the
inside
crackling
of
the
human
body
when
penetrate
by
a
blow
,
but
that
simple
creative
touch
could
not
save
the
rest
of
this
film
's
uninteresting
plot
movement
.
i
be
disappointed
for
jet
li
that
this
film
do
not
give
he
the
real
opportunity
to
star
in
a
good
story
with
many
great
action
scene
.
hopefully
,
the
next
time
will
be
a
charm
for
this
charismatic
actor
.
for
now
,
i
just
hope
that
for
he
sake
,
the
film
's
title
be
not
a
premonition
of
the
movie
's
ultimate
fate
at
the
box-office
.
