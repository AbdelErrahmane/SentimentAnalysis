review

in
the
1982
update
of
mickey
spillane
's
1947
novel
''
i
,
the
jury
,
''
hard-boiled
detective
mike
hammer
be
a
vietnam
vet
who
drive
a
shiny
bronze
trans
be
,
dress
like
don
johnson
in
''
miamus
vice
''
with
less
pastel
,
and
have
swear
off
alcohol
.
however
,
he
still
smoke
he
lucky
strike
,
detest
all
form
of
authority
,
and
kill
at
a
whim
.
beyond
that
,
the
update
film
retain
little
or
no
resemblance
to
the
original
pulpy
page-turner
by
spillane
,
probably
the
most
infamous
and
often
revile
of
all
mystery
writer
.
the
movie
start
off
with
a
bang
:
a
howler
of
a
opening
credit
sequence
that
be
a
cheap
steal
from
the
jame
bond
series
,
complete
with
cheesy
graphic
and
a
overbearing
jazz
score
by
bill
contus
-lrb-
''
rocky
''
-rrb-
.
after
that
,
the
movie
and
the
book
begin
the
same
,
with
the
murder
of
jack
william
-lrb-
frederick
downs
-rrb-
,
a
one-armed
detective
and
hammer
's
best
friend
.
hammer
declare
that
he
will
seek
vengeance
for
jack
's
death
,
and
with
the
help
of
he
devoted
secretary
,
the
blond
and
shapely
velda
-lrb-
laurene
landon
-rrb-
,
and
the
alternately
friendly
\/
antagonistic
police
chief
pat
chamber
-lrb-
paul
sorvino
-rrb-
,
he
be
immediately
on
the
killer
's
trail
.
here
the
movie
split
completely
from
the
book
,
and
dive
into
a
convoluted
and
improbable
tale
of
government
conspiracy
and
mind
control
tactic
involve
the
mafia
,
the
cium
,
one
of
hammer
's
vietnam
vet
buddy
,
and
a
kinky
sex
clinic
.
many
of
the
same
character
from
the
book
appear
in
the
movie
,
but
they
take
on
slightly
different
role
.
for
instance
,
charle
kaleckus
-lrb-
alan
king
-rrb-
,
a
number
runner
and
narcotic
dealer
in
the
book
,
turn
into
a
suave
mob
boss
.
and
,
more
importantly
,
hammer
's
suspicious
love
interest
,
charlotte
bennett
-lrb-
barbara
carrera
-rrb-
,
morph
from
a
run-of-the-mill
psychiatrist
into
the
coordinator
and
founder
of
the
sex
clinic
.
''
i
,
the
jury
''
be
one
of
several
cinematic
rendition
of
spillane
's
book
-lrb-
include
a
1953
version
which
be
make
in
3-d
-rrb-
,
but
this
film
differ
from
those
earlier
version
in
one
major
way
:
it
include
all
of
the
sex
and
violence
spillane
write
about
that
could
never
be
give
screen
treatment
due
to
hollywood
's
production
code
.
although
this
take
the
1982
version
of
''
i
,
the
jury
''
closer
to
the
core
of
the
original
subject
matter
,
it
be
in
this
aspect
that
the
film
receive
the
most
criticism
,
because
it
take
this
new
license
to
extreme
that
many
argue
surpass
what
be
in
the
book
.
rest
assure
,
the
movie
not
only
include
a
great
deal
of
nudity
,
but
it
be
thoroughly
violent
,
especially
toward
woman
.
it
feature
one
woman
have
she
neck
slash
,
a
set
of
twin
force
to
strip
before
be
stab
to
death
by
a
psychotic
sexual
deviant
program
by
the
cium
-lrb-
judson
scott
-rrb-
,
and
another
woman
shot
point-blank
in
the
belly
by
hammer
himself
.
no
one
would
deny
that
spillane
's
writing
have
a
definite
misogynistic
nature
,
but
the
movie
seem
to
take
it
a
step
further
by
give
it
such
glorious
screen
treatment
;
its
constant
equation
of
sex
and
violence
,
much
of
which
be
play
with
the
intention
of
be
erotic
,
be
quite
unsettling
.
it
be
no
surprise
that
the
movie
,
like
the
book
,
fade
to
black
with
a
dead
woman
on
the
floor
.
''
i
,
the
jury
''
have
a
troubled
production
and
be
not
well-supported
by
the
studio
that
make
it
,
which
be
one
explanation
why
it
do
not
do
well
in
theater
and
many
people
have
forget
that
it
be
ever
make
.
the
script
be
write
by
larry
cohen
,
who
be
best
know
for
he
creatively
cheesy
but
nonetheless
effective
monster
movie
,
like
''
it
be
alive
''
-lrb-
1974
-rrb-
and
its
two
sequel
,
''
q
''
-lrb-
1981
-rrb-
,
and
''
the
stuff
''
-lrb-
1985
-rrb-
.
cohen
write
the
script
think
he
be
go
to
helm
the
project
as
well
,
but
he
be
yank
from
the
director
's
chair
after
only
a
week
's
worth
of
shooting
because
he
be
already
$
100
,
000
over
budget
.
he
be
quickly
replace
by
richard
t
.
heffron
,
who
have
work
for
the
last
three
decade
on
a
handful
of
undistinguished
movie
and
dozen
of
television
project
.
heffron
be
obviously
bring
in
not
for
he
talent
,
but
because
he
could
make
the
movie
rapidly
and
efficiently
.
it
show
in
the
final
product
.
cohen
have
personal
interest
in
the
update
version
of
hammer
,
but
heffron
have
none
.
he
shoot
the
movie
quickly
and
clumsily
,
and
although
some
scene
ring
true
,
most
of
they
be
flat
,
trite
,
and
invariably
dull
.
the
movie
feature
numerous
car
chase
,
shoot-out
,
and
stunt
,
but
heffron
's
background
in
television
be
the
dominant
tone
;
despite
the
graphic
violence
and
full-frontal
nudity
,
''
i
,
the
jury
,
''
take
on
the
air
of
a
made-for-tv
quickie
,
with
no
real
punch
or
depth
.
but
the
problem
in
''
i
,
the
jury
''
run
deeper
than
the
technical
.
the
central
fault
in
this
update
be
mike
hammer
,
whose
character
be
lose
in
the
shuffle
while
update
from
the
fifty
to
the
eighty
.
because
spillane
write
all
he
hammer
mystery
in
the
first
person
,
hammer
's
character
be
central
to
the
tale
because
all
the
event
be
filter
through
he
persona
.
we
never
really
get
that
impression
in
the
movie
--
there
be
no
first-person
voice-over
narration
and
some
scene
do
not
have
hammer
in
they
at
all
.
consequently
,
a
great
deal
of
the
texture
of
spillane
's
storytelling
be
lose
.
the
period
update
turn
out
to
be
a
detrimentally
bad
idea
because
much
of
hammer
's
moral
code
be
throw
to
the
wind
.
despite
he
characterization
as
a
hard-nosed
,
violent
,
misogynistic
killer
,
hammer
always
stick
fervently
to
he
own
moral
code
.
the
title
itself
,
''
i
,
the
jury
,
''
refer
to
he
anti-establishment
notion
of
be
he
own
law
.
unlike
private
eye
who
seek
out
the
bad
guy
and
then
turn
they
over
the
police
,
hammer
both
pursue
the
criminal
and
exact
the
punishment
.
in
this
way
,
he
can
be
see
as
''
above
the
law
,
''
but
he
still
adhere
strictly
to
she
own
personal
code
of
conduct
,
he
own
morality
.
the
movie
forgo
that
aspect
of
he
character
,
and
hammer
come
off
not
only
as
amoral
in
society
's
term
,
but
in
any
term
,
especially
he
own
.
if
anything
,
hammer
always
have
he
professionalism
,
but
the
movie
do
away
with
that
in
the
first
three
minute
by
show
he
roll
in
the
sack
with
the
wife
of
a
client
who
have
pay
he
to
find
out
if
that
wife
be
be
unfaithful
.
maybe
the
scene
be
intend
for
laugh
,
but
it
only
cheapen
hammer
's
character
and
be
,
by
all
account
,
a
lousy
way
to
start
the
movie
.
the
blame
for
hammer
's
character
can
not
be
lay
on
assante
's
shoulder
,
because
despite
some
unnecessary
marlon
brandon-like
mumbling
,
he
deliver
a
fine
performance
.
spillane
never
once
describe
hammer
's
physical
attribute
in
any
of
the
dozen
book
in
which
he
appear
,
so
any
actor
could
conceivably
portray
he
.
of
course
,
because
of
the
lack
of
write
description
,
those
who
have
read
spillane
's
book
will
have
a
strong
personal
notion
of
what
hammer
look
like
,
and
therefore
almost
any
screen
incarnation
will
somehow
fall
short
of
expectation
-lrb-
spillane
,
who
play
the
character
himself
in
1963
's
''
the
girl
hunter
,
''
be
generally
consider
the
best
of
the
film
hammer
-rrb-
.
the
rest
of
actor
be
most
un-noteworthy
.
with
the
exception
of
alan
king
and
paul
sorvino
,
everyone
who
appear
in
''
i
,
the
jury
''
be
up-and-comer
who
basically
go
nowhere
.
many
of
they
end
up
work
in
television
-lrb-
like
carrera
,
who
have
a
short
stint
on
''
dalla
''
in
the
mid-eighty
-rrb-
,
which
only
add
to
the
made-for-tv
atmosphere
of
the
film
.
maybe
someday
,
someone
will
manage
to
get
the
right
element
together
and
make
a
effective
film
rendition
of
a
spillane
book
,
but
this
be
certainly
not
it
.
