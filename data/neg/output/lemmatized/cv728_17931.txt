back
in
1980s
,
chuck
norris
use
to
be
synonym
for
the
action
film
.
he
could
not
,
of
course
,
top
the
success
and
fame
of
big
action
name
like
sylvester
stallone
or
arnold
schwarzenegger
,
but
sheer
quantity
of
he
film
guarantee
that
he
be
household
name
among
shoot
'em
up
and
beat
'em
up
genre
aficionado
.
that
quantity
be
mostly
provide
by
cannon
group
,
prolific
production
company
that
dominate
the
b-movie
market
in
previous
decade
by
flood
it
with
cheap
,
formulaic
and
,
more
often
than
not
,
unwatchable
genre
product
.
the
hitman
,
1991
action
thriller
direct
by
chuck
's
brother
aaron
,
be
one
of
the
last
among
they
.
chuck
norris
here
play
seattle
cop
betray
,
shoot
and
leave
for
dead
by
he
partner
-lrb-
which
should
not
surprise
anyone
,
consider
the
fact
that
the
partner
be
be

for
role
of
usually
very
mean
character

.
survive
the
shooting
,
cop
be
pronounced
dead
and
hire
as
deep
undercover
agent
.
he
infiltrate
the
underworld
circle
in
seattle
and
become

top
hitman
,
use
he
ability
to
start
brutal
war
between
three
major
crime
organization
-
italian
,
french
canadian
and
iranian
.
since
it
be
rather
absurd
to
expect
great
act
ability
from
chuck
norris
,
at
least
not
in
this
kind
of
movie
,
the
biggest
attraction
of
this
film
should
have
be
action
.
well
,
the
action
in
this
film
fall
flat
-
it
be
boring
,
repetitive
and
not
at
all
exciting
.
it
be
nothing
more
than
monotonous
series
of
scene
that
contain
violence
too
brutal
even
for
this
type
of
film
.
we
know
very
little
about
norri
'
character
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
gangster
be
portray
with
more
human
dimension
.
in
the
end
we
almost
feel
sorry
for
they
,
since
they
be
show
totally
powerless
against
norri
and
he
unstoppable
and
bloody
crusade
.
during
the
film
,
somebody
obviously
become
aware
of
that
problem
,
so
the
screenwriter
introduce
the
subplot
deal
with
the
black
boy
who
get
adopt
by
norri
.
that
cause
another
problem
-
any
question
about
nature
of
that
relationship
have
to
be
quash
with
another
subplot
-
this
one
deal
with
lady
lawyer
who
sleep
with
the
hero
and
get
kill
after
fulfil
that
screenplay
obligation
.
the
photography
in
this
film
be
dark
,
set
be
depressive
and
this
forgettable
piece
of
1980s
style
cinema
leave
viewer
without
any
reason
to
justify
the
hour
and
half
spend
in
watch
it
.
