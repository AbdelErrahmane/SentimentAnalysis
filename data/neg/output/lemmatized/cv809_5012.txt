die
hard
2
be
a
altogether
unfortunate
fiasco
,
inferior
to
the
original
in
every
respect
.
place
the
blame
squarely
on
the
shoulder
of
steven
de
souza
and
doug
richardson
,
who
write
the
film
's
pathetic
screenplay
.
every
line
of
dialogue
reek
of
either
smarmy
sap
or
force
humor
.
the
plot
be
altogether
implausible
;
the
convoluted
story
line
involve
a
band
of
terrorist
who
take
over
dulle
airport
and
shut
down
the
control
tower
,
leave
a
dozen
plane
strand
in
the
air
wait
to
land
.
the
film
have
zero
credibility
,
and
all
of
the
character
come
off
as
cliched
,
cardboard
cut-out
.
so
much
for
the
script
.
how
about
the
action
?
well
,
let
's
put
it
this
way
:
director
renny
harlin
could
learn
a
few
thing
from
john
mctiernan
,
who
direct
the
original
,
as
well
as
the
hunt
for
red
October
and
predator
--
all
standout
for
they
hair-raising
suspense
.
by
contrast
,
harlin
do
not
have
a
clue
when
it
come
to
choreograph
action
,
and
consequently
,
die
hard
2
never
pick
up
steam
.
die
harder
be
impossible
to
take
seriously
even
for
a
minute
.
in
fact
,
the
movie
often
seem
deliberately
campy
,
and
it
almost
reach
the
threshold
of
be
so
bad
it
be
good
.
you
do
laugh
,
but
you
laugh
at
the
film
,
not
with
it
.
die
hard
2
should
have
never
be
clear
for
takeoff
.
