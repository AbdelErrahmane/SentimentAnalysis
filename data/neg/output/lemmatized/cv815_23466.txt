a
list
of
talented
individual
we
have
get
here
.
grant
,
john
goodman
be
in
the
flintstone
,
and
greg
kinnear
have
turn
in
some
less-than-lackluster
leading
man
performance
in
certified
failure
like
a
smile
like
yours
,
but
even
so
,
they
have
get
proven
power
as
excellent
support
player
.
garry
shandling
have
two
television
classic
under
he
belt
,
he
ingenious
little
it
be
garry
shandling
's
show
and
the
larry
sander
show
.
and
for
god
's
sake
,
mike
nichol
direct
the
graduate
,
and
annette
bening
be
just
walk
away
from
american
beauty
.
so
explain
this
...
this
...
thing
.
what
planet
be
you
from
?
purport
to
be
a
comedy
explore
the
relationship
between
man
and
woman
satirize
the
whole
pop-psychology
mars\/venus
phenomenon
.
but
what
this
movie
wind
up
be
be
a
collection
of
unfunny
cringe-inducing
moment
couple
with
uninsightful
cringe-inducing
moment
;
the
end
result
be
,
unsurprisingly
,
a
unfunny
,
uninsightful
,
cringe-inducing
,
thoroughly
icky
embarrassment
.
garry
shandling
play
a
alien
from
a
planet
populate
by
technologically
advance
but
emotionally
vacant
male
-lrb-
they
reproduce
through
cloning
,
of
course
-rrb-
.
he
leader
put
a
select
group
of
male
through
a
series
of
test
design
to
determine
which
one
be
most
fit
to
fly
off
to
earth
,
find
a
female
of
the
species
,
and
impregnate
she
.
they
be
teach
how
to
pretend
that
they
be
listen
by
nod
and
say
''
uh-huh
,
''
and
how
to
compliment
shoe
.
imagine
my
delighted
surprise
when
,
oh
heaven
,
all
they
carefully
practice
tactic
turn
out
to
fail
miserably
,
produce
comedic
result
!
the
lucky
winner
be
fit
with
a
penis
-lrb-
since
theirs
,
after
generation
of
disuse
have
long
since
shrink
out
of
existence
...
i
will
restrain
myself
from
mention
the
implausibility
of
such
a
scenario
since
the
population
have
stop
evolve
due
to
the
fact
that
they
be
all
just
clone
...
whoop
,
too
late
.
-rrb-
the
penis
,
when
arouse
,
tend
to
make
a
humming
noise
.
the
writer
,
when
frequently
strap
for
idea
,
tend
to
turn
to
this
as
a
source
of
''
comedy
.
''
it
be
not
funny
the
first
time
.
it
be
not
funny
the
eighth
time
.
it
be
not
funny
the
eighteenth
time
.
if
anything
,
it
make
I
feel
vaguely
self-conscious
.
garry
meet
up
with
a
coworker
at
a
bank
play
by
greg
kinnear
,
who
turn
out
to
be
a
generic
,
unlikable
scumbag
.
he
be
mean
to
fill
the
part
of
unfortunate
role
model
for
shandling
's
alien
character
,
but
he
be
so
flatly
draw
that
even
the
writer
quickly
give
up
and
toss
he
aside
.
kinnear
's
scumbagginess
be
demonstrate
by
the
fact
that
he
claim
other
people
'
work
as
he
own
to
worm
he
way
into
a
vice
president
'
position
and
go
to
aa
meeting
to
pick
up
chick
.
wow
.
what
a
magnificent
bastard
.
nearly
every
man
in
the
movie
,
in
fact
,
be
play
as
the
same
sort
of
sex-driven
slimeball
.
when
kinnear
's
wife
walk
into
the
office
,
there
be
not
a
single
guy
who
do
not
trip
,
bump
into
a
wall
,
or
otherwise
pratfall
as
if
they
would
never
see
a
woman
before
.
the
few
guy
that
be
not
particularly
slimeball
,
such
as
john
goodman
's
detective
character
,
be
simply
uncommunicative
workaholic
.
shandle
meet
up
with
annette
bening
,
who
will
inevitably
prove
to
be
the
love
he
never
know
exist
,
at
one
of
kinnear
's
aa
meeting
.
shandling
's
mission
be
to
have
a
baby
,
and
when
he
reveal
he
desire
to
she
,
ben
instantly
fall
for
he
,
and
the
next
day
...
they
get
marry
.
yup
.
the
next
day
.
cuz
ya
see
,
it
turn
out
she
want
a
baby
too
!
bening
's
character
perhaps
be
the
most
difficult
to
watch
,
especially
after
see
she
come
apart
at
the
seam
so
effectively
in
american
beauty
...
if
she
character
here
be
suppose
to
be
represent
the
female
of
the
species
as
a
whole
,
then
woe
,
i
say
,
to
the
species
.
she
be
unfathomably
insecure
,
and
succumb
so
easily
to
all
of
shandling
's
line
and
lie
that
it
border
on
tragic
.
there
be
a
point
where
,
after
think
she
may
not
be
able
to
bear
child
,
she
learn
that
she
be
indeed
pregnant
.
when
garry
come
home
after
nearly
cheat
on
she
,
she
stroll
into
the
kitchen
and
sing
''
high
hope
''
-lrb-
you
know
,
the
uplifting
ant
and
the
rubber
tree
plant
song
-rrb-
to
deliver
the
news
,
and
then
say
to
he
,
''
now
you
can
not
leave
I
.
''
we
be
suppose
to
empathize
with
shandling
's
discovery
of
the
feeling
of
''
guilt
,
''
but
instead
i
want
to
weep
for
ben
that
she
be
place
she
entire
life
and
soul
firmly
in
the
lap
of
a
great
big
nothing
.
and
eventually
,
shandle
fall
in
love
with
she
...
for
real
,
i
suppose
,
though
i
be
not
sure
exactly
what
prompt
it
.
what
be
the
message
i
derive
from
all
this
?
man
be
liar
,
inherently
empty
creature
,
but
if
you
hang
around
long
enough
...
well
,
maybe
something
will
click
.
ha
ha
...
ha
?
i
be
thankful
such
broad
cynicism
be
not
frequently
allow
to
run
so
rampant
.
let
's
all
join
hand
and
pray
that
the
planet
these
folk
be
from
be
not
this
one
.
there
be
also
a
subplot
involve
john
goodman
as
a
airline
incident
investigator
that
wade
in
the
bog
of
stupidity
.
goodman
,
through
a
series
of
astoundingly
implausible
realization
,
put
together
the
fact
that
shandling
be
a
be
from
another
world
with
a
magic
,
vibrate
penis
.
it
have
all
the
makings
for
a
subplot
of
have
shandling
be
discover
,
that
,
thankfully
,
never
come
to
the
inevitable
hackneyed
fruition
.
instead
,
it
just
dangle
limply
on
the
branch
for
a
while
,
withers
,
and
fall
away
.
further
proof
that
goodman
should
just
stick
to
do
coen
brother
movie
.
but
let
's
not
dwell
on
this
any
longer
,
i
have
already
waste
plenty
of
you
time
and
my
own
.
let
's
move
on
,
forget
about
what
we
have
see
here
,
and
get
on
with
we
life
.
and
to
help
we
out
,
let
's
end
thing
on
a
happy
note
...
congratuation
go
out
to
annette
bening
,
winner
of
this
week
's
''
title
!
''
award
,
for
deliver
the
awkward
line
of
dialog
contain
the
movie
's
name
.
