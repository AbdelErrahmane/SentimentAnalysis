tommy
lee
jone
chase
a
innocent
victim
around
america
who
be
try
to
prove
that
she
do
not
kill
she
spouse
.
the
fugitive
?
not
quite
?
this
be
the
plot
for
double
jeopardy
,
another
fugitive
copycat
without
the
action
,
excitement
,
and
good
act
that
the
original
have
.
there
be
other
slight
difference
besides
one
movie
be
bad
and
the
other
good
;
this
time
tommy
lee
jone
play
a
parole
officer
not
a
we
marshall
,
clever
huh
?
oh
and
the
fugitive
ashley
judd
be
frame
by
she
own
husband
-lrb-
bruce
greenwood
-rrb-
who
need
to
collect
two
million
dollar
in
life
insurance
money
not
a
one
armed
man
.
both
movie
be
on
video
.
make
the
wise
choice
and
pick
the
fugitive
.
there
be
so
many
flaw
in
double
jeopardy
,
it
be
laughable
.
while
serve
time
in
prison
,
libby
parson
-lrb-
judd
-rrb-
discover
that
she
can
never
be
charge
for
commit
the
same
crime
twice
.
learn
that
she
husband
be
still
alive
,
she
decide
to
serve
she
time
in
prison
,
find
he
,
retrieve
she
son
,
and
kill
she
husband
if
necessary
.
when
the
strict
parole
officer
travi
lehman
-lrb-
jone
-rrb-
stand
in
she
way
,
libby
decide
to
break
the
rule
-lrb-
who
know
why
?
-rrb-
and
continue
she
plan
,
despite
the
fact
that
if
she
get
catch
,
she
be
go
back
to
jail
.
director
bruce
beresford
spend
way
too
much
time
try
to
convince
the
audience
that
libby
miss
she
son
.
every
other
scene
,
we
be
give
a
shot
of
libby
stare
and
cry
at
he
picture
.
in
a
action
movie
like
this
,
valuable
time
waste
on
these
shot
take
away
more
opportunity
for
libby
to
get
up
and
do
something
.
all
that
be
need
in
this
type
of
movie
be
a
short
scene
in
which
libby
tell
herself
or
a
friend
''
i
miss
my
son
.
''
nothing
more
,
nothing
less
.
dr
.
kimble
of
the
fugitive
do
not
look
at
one
picture
of
he
dead
wife
,
he
primary
concern
be
to
save
himself
.
libby
at
time
show
this
same
determination
but
not
nearly
enough
.
ashley
judd
and
bruce
greenwood
both
be
excellent
actor
but
if
they
continue
to
do
movie
like
this
,
they
will
be
typecast
for
the
rest
of
they
career
,
kind
of
like
they
doomed
co-star
tommy
lee
jone
.
win
a
oscar
for
the
fugitive
must
have
convince
jone
that
audience
will
never
get
tire
of
he
i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty
role
.
people
still
pay
to
see
he
movie
and
he
make
plenty
of
money
so
i
guess
he
be
right
.
though
i
do
not
think
he
will
win
another
oscar
again
.
the
ultimate
mistake
in
the
script
be
what
eventually
become
of
libby
parson
.
even
if
she
be
excuse
for
disobey
she
parole
officer
,
the
number
of
other
crime
she
commit
while
on
the
run
be
too
numerous
to
count
.
burglary
,
assault
,
grand
theft
auto
be
some
of
libby
's
slipup
.
the
message
of
the
movie
be
you
can
break
all
of
the
small
law
as
long
as
you
be
innocent
of
the
major
crime
.
hopefully
criminal
will
not
use
double
jeopardy
as
a
reference
in
court
for
why
they
be
innocent
.
that
would
just
be
plain
stupid
.
