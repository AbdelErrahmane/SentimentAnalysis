okay
,
bear
with
I
y'
all
,
cause
first
off
i
have
to
get
this
off
my
chest
:
what
the
hell
be
up
with
that
damn
crab
?
?
?
whew
.
okay
.
cause
that
same
clip
show
over
and
over
again
be
begin
to
get
on
my
nerve
towards
the
end
,
as
cute
as
the
crab
maybe
.
even
i
know
that
you
need
more
footage
than
\*
that
\*
.
and
that
be
not
the
only
thing
get
on
my
nerve
.
the
cutesy
gimmick
,
saccharine
sweet
score
\/
soundtrack
and
the
pretty
young
face
of
sarah
michelle
gellar
-lrb-
as
amanda
-rrb-
and
sean
patrick
flannery
-lrb-
as
tom
-rrb-
might
have
hold
some
appeal
during
,
oh
,
say
the
first
10
minute
of
the
movie
.
at
first
the
movie
move
along
at
a
quick
,
interesting
pace
.
it
be
speedily
establish
that
something
magical
be
about
to
happen
to
amanda
when
she
encounter
a
totally
random
fairy
godfather
type
person
on
the
street
,
whose
aforementioned
crab
follow
she
everywhere
and
just
\*
do
not
\*
die
.
a
ridiculous
concept
,
yes
,
but
at
this
point
i
be
willing
to
accept
it
because
i
be
willing
to
accept
that
this
be
how
amanda
's
life
be
change
,
how
she
power
be
receive
.
later
on
,
the
movie
can
not
seem
to
decide
whether
these
power
come
from
this
fairy
godfather
or
from
amanda
fall
in
with
tom
.
and
this
be
why
the
clip
of
the
crab
be
annoy
;
they
be
not
just
repetitive
,
they
be
out
of
place
and
unnecessary
.
the
plot
stumble
along
at
a
uneven
speed
,
sometimes
dwelling
too
long
on
a
particular
development
-lrb-
amanda
suddenly
become
a
great
chef
,
she
fall
in
love
with
tom
,
etc
.
-rrb-
,
sometimes
move
on
too
quickly
for
its
own
good
.
some
place
the
plot
just
do
not
make
sense
,
sometimes
it
be
way
too
contrived
-lrb-
the
crab
bit
,
for
example
-rrb-
,
and
sometimes
too
corny
-lrb-
peach
emit
dry
ice
.
can
not
beat
that
-rrb-
.
all
in
all
the
plot
seem
fragmented
,
unconnected
.
not
romantic
at
all
,
and
only
funny
in
some
place
.
so
,
okay
,
do
the
magic
power
come
from
the
crab
?
or
the
fairy
godfather
?
she
can
\*
float
\*
now
too
?
and
all
of
a
sudden
,
instead
of
just
make
dry
ice
come
out
of
peach
,
she
can
put
she
emotion
into
she
food
?
tom
all
of
a
sudden
just
accept
amanda
's
''
witchcraft
''
in
the
end
?
would
people
really
dine
in
a
restaurant
that
resemble
life
after
death
in
tupac
's
video
?
what
the
hell
be
up
with
that
damn
crab
?
it
be
unfortunate
,
because
i
like
the
basic
premise
of
the
movie
,
until
it
become
too
fantastical
and
tiresome
.
the
film
seem
to
skirt
around
a
serious
theme
or
at
least
\*
a
\*
theme
for
a
while
,
but
towards
the
end
it
resolve
to
show
we
long
flashback
clip
and
5
minute
of
people
cry
at
they
table
.
the
humor
be
good
in
some
place
-lrb-
nolan
get
the
funniest
bit
,
include
that
incomprehensible
,
totally
random
thing
with
the
doll
-rrb-
.
gellar
and
flannery
be
qualify
actor
,
and
gellar
have
a
particular
charm
,
but
i
much
prefer
she
playing
the
saucy
buffy
-lrb-
or
even
annette
in
the
upcome
''
cruel
intention
''
-rrb-
than
this
sorry
excuse
for
a
character
.
it
be
almost
funny
sometimes
to
see
these
two
try
so
hard
to
make
the
dialogue
sound
better
than
it
be
,
or
try
to
make
the
relationship
seem
more
plausible
.
the
support
character
nolan
be
a
highlight
,
though
he
remind
I
a
bit
of
kevin
in
''
you
have
get
mail
''
-lrb-
see
footnote
-rrb-
.
and
,
as
always
,
typical
of
a
chick
flick
\/
romantic
comedy
,
there
be
a
seemingly
endless
romantic
soundtrack
in
the
background
,
cue
up
at
all
the
right
place
.
this
sort
of
get
on
the
nerve
after
a
while
,
too
.
''
simply
irresistible
''
be
not
hard
to
understand
,
light
,
funny
in
some
place
,
and
generally
disappointing
because
it
can
not
draw
the
line
between
romance
and
protracted
sap
,
between
humor
and
tired
slapstick
.
and
how
could
i
refrain
from
make
a
pun
?
.
.
.
''
simply

''
be
all
too
easy
to
resist
