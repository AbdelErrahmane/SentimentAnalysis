when
consider
david
fincher
's
latest
film
,
''
the
game
''
,
four
word
come
to
mind
.
''
do
not
believe
the
hype
.
''
this
michael
dougla
vehicle
,
from
the
director
of
''
seven
''
,
be
not
nearly
as
clever
or
innovatively
suspenseful
as
it
would
have
we
believe
.
the
film
draw
we
in
with
a
intriguing
concept
-lrb-
aid
no
doubt
by
the
riveting
trailer
-rrb-
where
a
jaded
millionaire
-lrb-
dougla
-rrb-
be
present
with
the
opportunity
to
enter
into
a
living
fantasy
.
this
be
not
simply
virtual
reality
.
this
be
real
life
with
a
deadly
twist
.
on
he
48th
birthday
,
nichola
van
orton
-lrb-
dougla
-rrb-
be
invite
to
dinner
by
he
underachieving
younger
brother
,
conrad
-lrb-
sean
penn
-rrb-
.
conrad
have
a
special
birthday
present
for
he
brother
.
he
hand
nichola
a
gift
certificate
and
tell
he
to
contact
a
company
call
consumer
recreation
service
.
''
they
make
you
life
fun
,
''
conrad
tell
he
.
nichola
humor
he
brother
,
tell
he
he
'll
call
,
but
it
be
clear
he
have
no
time
for
any
foolish
,
''
fantasy
role-playing
,
''
as
he
call
it
.
then
,
for
reason
that
be
never
really
make
clear
,
nicholas
decide
to
go
to
cr
and
see
what
they
be
all
about
.
he
end
up
spend
a
whole
day
go
through
they
screening
process
,
which
to
I
make
no
sense
consider
the
tight
schedule
he
keep
claim
to
have
.
nevertheless
,
when
it
seem
nichola
have
be
reject
as
a
cr
client
,
the
weird
thing
start
happen
.
of
course
,
when
we
have
only
cover
about
30
minute
of
screen
time
,
what
else
should
we
expect
.
dougla
have
build
he
modern
career
around
play
powerful
,
violent
and
unlikable
man
be
manipulate
by
unseen
hand
.
one
of
those
film
,
''
basic
instinct
''
,
come
from
the
creative
mind
of
writer
,
joe
eszterha
and
director
,
paul
verhoeven
.
the
premise
of
''
the
game
,
''
be
not
unlike
the
concept
of
another
verhoeven
film
,
''
total
recall
.
''
in
that
case
,
the
premise
be
implant
someone
else
's
memory
as
a
way
to
enhance
one
's
own
life
through
a
dream
vacation
.
yet
,
in
both
film
,
the
real
goal
be
to
create
a
vicarious
bond
with
the
audience
.
we
live
the
adventure
along
with
the
protagonist
,
react
to
each
twist
and
turn
.
in
theory
,
the
key
to
the
suspense
be
not
be
to
tell
what
be
real
and
what
be
not
.
all
we
can
do
be
hang
on
until
the
end
of
the
ride
,
when
the
truth
be
finally
reveal
.
now
,
for
those
of
you
who
forget
,
let
I
say
this
again
.
''
do
not
believe
the
hype
.
''
''
the
game
''
be
not
a
thrilling
roller
coaster
ride
.
as
a
suspense-thriller
,
it
do
not
do
much
but
spin
in
circle
.
by
the
third
reel
,
i
be
fight
back
sleep
and
check
my
watch
as
i
endure
the
predictable
plot
.
be
it
any
wonder
dougla
will
not
be
able
to
resist
the
charm
of
a
mysterious
,
potentially
life-threatening
blonde
-lrb-
ever
hear
of
glenn
close
?
no
?
well
,
how
about
sharon
stone
?
think
so
-rrb-
.
if
anything
in
this
film
surprise
you
at
all
,
i
would
guess
you
have
not
see
that
many
film
.
there
be
no
suspense
here
.
trust
I
,
i
look
hard
to
find
some
.
i
have
to
settle
for
contrived
gimmick
and
ridiculously
implausible
situation
.
fincher
aim
's
for
hitchcock
but
land
somewhere
just
north
of
joe
eszterha
.
there
be
those
that
might
say
''
the
game
''
be
not
intend
to
be
view
literally
.
i
would
submit
that
be
exactly
the
way
i
try
to
view
the
film
.
the
film
simply
do
not
have
the
tooth
to
bite
into
any
real
psychological
issue
.
there
be
a
moment
early
in
the
film
where
van
orton
,
realize
he
game
have
begin
,
smile
as
he
walk
through
the
airport
try
to
figure
out
who
be
in
on
the
whole
thing
.
he
be
charge
by
he
paranoia
.
he
be
look
at
the
world
through
new
eye
.
it
be
the
last
thought-provoking
moment
in
the
film
.
from
there
on
,
the
director
only
want
to
stay
a
step
ahead
of
we
.
any
significant
archetype
that
be
set
up
in
the
beginning
of
the
film
be
simply
turn
into
a
plot
device
.
at
the
outset
,
we
be
tell
each
''
game
''
be
tailor
to
the
individual
.
ultimately
,
this
''
game
''
be
suppose
to
work
like
a
crucible
,
try
this
obscenely
wealthy
and
emotionally
detach
aristocrat
by
fire
,
prove
he
soul
.
yet
,
as
dougla
endure
he
personal
gauntlet
,
we
be
give
very
few
piece
of
the
puzzle
to
illuminate
we
on
who
this
man
really
be
.
i
want
to
like
this
film
more
than
i
do
.
i
look
at
it
as
just
anothergreat
idea
,
poorly
realize
.
i
can
think
of
at
least
two
other
superior
film
where
watch
the
film
do
not
mean
we
be
see
what
be
really
happen
.
bryan
singer
's
''
the
usual
suspect
''
for
one
,
a
film
that
be
truly
unique
in
its
ability
to
get
you
lose
in
the
detail
before
pull
back
to
show
you
the
full
masterpiece
on
the
canvas
.
also
,
there
be
the
underrated
''
jacob
's
ladder
,
''
with
tim
robbin
,
a
film
that
really
have
to
be
watch
twice
before
you
recognize
the
significance
of
all
its
symbolism
.
here
be
two
example
of
film
that
do
not
simply
manipulate
for
manipulation
'
sake
.
there
be
film
that
use
they
labyrinth
structure
to
lead
we
to
a
meaningful
place
.
one
major
issue
that
come
up
in
''
the
game
''
be
whether
or
not
the
whole
''
illusion
''
be
just
a
highly
sophisticated
con
game
.
well
,
i
can
tell
you
right
now
,
after
you
have
spend
you
$
7
dollar
,
you
may
be
ask
yourself
the
same
thing
.
