capsule
:
combine
one
quart
of
raider
of
the
lose
ark
,
a
dash
of
a
jackie
chan
movie
-lrb-
san
jackie
-rrb-
,
two
teaspoon
of
gun
-
and
swordplay
,
and
a
dollop
of
cgus
.
simmer
for
100
minute
.
yield
:
zilch
.
the
phantom
be
a
depressing
and
tired
retread
of
so
many
earlier
,
better
movie
that
after
the
fifteen-minute
mark
i
start
catalogue
they
out
loud
.
it
be
hard
to
make
a
good
action-adventure
movie
that
do
not
simply
recycle
its
predecessor
,
and
i
have
see
movie
that
even
at
least
do
the
recycle
gracefully
.
the
phantom
,
allegedly
base
on
the
long-running
comic
of
the
same
name
,
do
not
even
bother
to
be
graceful
.
it
be
a
stupid
and
incompetent
movie
in
too
many
way
to
list
,
but
i
'll
try
.
the
film
open
up
with
a
''
prelude
''
sequence
that
look
like
it
be
slash
to
ribbon
in
the
editing
and
then
give
a
heavy
voice-over
to
compensate
for
whatever
get
throw
out
.
we
go
from
there
to
a
jungle
sequence
that
,
i
swear
to
god
,
recycle
the
truck-chase
scene
from
raider
of
the
lose
ark
note-for-note
,
possibly
even
shot-for-shot
,
right
down
to
the
moment
where
indy
wrench
open
the
door
and
sling
one
of
the
driver
out
into
the
brush
--
and
then
go
on
to
rip
off
the
rope-bridge
scene
from
''
sorcerer
''
as
well
!
sorcerer
,
as
you
may
well
remember
,
be
a
remake
of
a
french
movie
,
the
wages
of
fear
,
in
which
a
bunch
of
lowlife
be
pay
pile
of
money
to
drive
a
truck
load
with
nitro
through
horrible
jungle
terrain
.
both
version
of
that
movie
be
far
more
interesting
than
this
flick
,
but
i
have
get
my
job
to
do
,
so
back
to
the
salt
mine
we
go
.
anyway
,
the
cinematic
theft
do
not
stop
there
.
or
at
least
the
lack
of
inspiration
.
there
be
not
a
single
thing
here
we
have
not
see
,
and
it
be
not
give
to
we
in
a
way
that
remotely
evoke
we
interest
.
we
have
-lrb-
where
's
my
list
?
-rrb-
a
bad
girl
,
a
tough
good
girl
,
a
secret
cave
hideaway
-lrb-
which
seem
inspire
more
by
dr
.
no
than
anything
else
-rrb-
,
a
boardroom
meeting
that
drip
with
greed
and
venality
,
magical
artifact
of
terrible
power
,
and
cary-hiroyukus
tagawa
waste
in
another
stupid
role
where
he
get
to
wear
a
fu
manchu
mustache
and
sneer
a
lot
and
generally
humiliate
himself
.
what
else
be
there
?
the
plot
be
a
waste
of
time
.
the
set
alternate
between
big
but
hokey
--
and
tiny
and
still
hokey
.
there
be
line
in
the
script
that
be
just
beg
to
be
mst3ke
--
and
i
be
sure
once
mike
and
the
`
bot
get
the
cash
,
they
'll
stick
it
on
they
sked
.
the
only
thing
in
the
movie
worth
note
be
billy
zane
--
he
be
a
good
actor
,
and
he
try
very
hard
,
even
when
the
script
be
send
he
down
one
dead
alley
of
a
scene
after
another
.
all
i
can
say
be
that
i
pray
this
be
not
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
he
--
although
it
sure
look
like
the
final
nail
in
the
coffin
for
the
comic-book
super-hero
movie
.
