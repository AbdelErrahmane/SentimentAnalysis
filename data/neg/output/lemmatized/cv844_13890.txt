comment
:
so
,
what
do
a
ex-gangbanger
turn
insubordinate
traffic
cop
,
a
former
prostitute
with
a
substance
abuse
problem
,
and
a
junkie
turn
dennis
rodman
wannabe
turn
cop
who
crash
four
police
cruiser
all
have
in
common
?
why
,
they
be
all
member
of
blade
squad
,
a
elite
new
crimefighting
unit
wear
black
uniform
,
rollerblade
,
and
jetpack
!
they
also
carry
video
camera
so
they
can
communicate
with
one
another
a
la
the
marine
in
jame
cameron
's
alien
.
yes
,
it
be
blade
squad
,
the
fox
network
's
Wednesday
night
movie
of
the
week
.
this
''
movie
,
''
mark
its
dubious
world
premiere
today
,
curiously
have
a
number
of
guest
star
.
''
how
can
a
movie
have
guest
star
?
''
you
may
ask
.
well
,
blade
squad
be
not
really
a
movie
so
to
speak
but
a
2
hour
pilot
for
a
possible
tv
series
package
as
a
movie
.
blade
squad
be
dumb
.
blade
squad
be
loud
.
blade
squad
be
obnoxious
.
blade
squad
will
probably
be
a
rating
hit
and
spawn
a
long-lived
tv
series
.
why
not
?
after
all
,
television
have
give
its
audience
crimefighter
with
talk
car
-lrb-
''
knight
rider
''
-rrb-
,
fast
helicopter
-lrb-
''
airwolf
''
-rrb-
,
and
super
fast
motorcycle
-lrb-
''
street
hawk
''
-rrb-
,
and
viewer
have
eat
it
up
in
the
past
.
so
,
why
not
crimefighter
with
jet-powered
roller
blade
?
to
be
honest
,
as
a
made-for-tv
presentation
,
blade
squad
be
at
least
watchable
.
the
film
have
a
relatively
large
cast
of
character
,
a
surprisingly
intelligible
albeit
predictable
script
,
and
enough
action
sequence
to
keep
one
half-interested
.
i
would
imagine
adolescent
male
,
probably
the
target
audience
of
this
turkey
,
would
get
a
kick
out
of
it
.
i
try
to
keep
that
in
mind
when
i
watch
blade
squad
.
i
can
remember
liking
''
airwolf
''
and
''
street
hawk
''
when
i
be
10
or
11
.
and
,
although
this
be
not
say
much
,
blade
squad
be
leap
and
bound
better
than
the
last
fox
network
movie
i
have
the
displeasure
of
waste
time
on
:
the
insipidly
awful
generation
x
-lrb-
a
huge
disappointment
consider
the
comic
book
's
terrific
two-year
beginning
-rrb-
.
but
,
i
digress
.
despite
its
limited
appeal
,
blade
squad
have
a
lot
of
kink
to
work
out
if
the
movie
be
to
become
a
tv
series
.
one
,
it
suffer
from
mtv
syndrome
:
a
lot
of
quick
shot
and
weird
angle
continuously
jar
the
viewer
's
sens
while
a
near
nonstop
generic
rock
soundtrack
blare
incessantly
in
the
background
.
oh
yeah
,
dylan
's
''
knockin
'
on
heaven
's
door
''
and
bowie
's
''
i
be
afraid
of
american
''
be
use
here
,
in
rather
poor
taste
.
two
,
blade
squad
need
a
new
crew
for
the
sound
.
the
substandard
sound
editing
irritated
I
to
no
end
.
character
'
dialogue
,
at
time
,
sound
choppy
and
unintelligible
.
during
one
important
scene
,
a
song
play
loudly
in
the
background
.
when
a
character
speak
,
the
song
's
volume
drop
but
do
not
disappear
.
as
soon
as
that
character
finish
speaking
,
the
song
's
volume
immediately
return
to
its
original
level
until
the
next
character
speak
.
this
sound
trivial
,
i
be
sure
,
but
it
distract
I
immensely
.
finally
,
this
be
commercial
television
.
foul
language
be
not
allow
,
typically
,
on
commercial
television
.
thus
,
do
not
use
foul
language
in
a
made-for-tv
production
because
that
foul
language
have
to
be
censor
in
some
manner
.
in
a
early
scene
of
the
film
,
for
example
,
the
lead
good
guy
and
bad
guy
have
a
minor
confrontation
in
the
street
.
when
the
good
guy
spout
out
a
bad
word
,
a
driver
conveniently
honk
he
car
's
horn
off-screen
to
muffle
the
word
out
.
in
a
''
seinfeld
''
episode
,
this
technique
prove
funny
;
here
,
it
seem
goofy
and
cut
the
dramatic
tension
considerably
.
perhaps
future
writer
,
if
a
show
be
spin
out
of
the
movie
,
could
take
a
cue
from
marvel
comic
'
2099
series
of
comic
.
make
up
a
bunch
of
new
bad
word
for
the
future
.
this
way
,
you
do
not
need
a
bunch
of
honk
horn
or
other
silly
device
to
cover
up
foul
language
.
compare
to
the
usual
crap
broadcast
tv
network
have
to
offer
in
term
of
movie
,
blade
squad
be
a
suitable
exercise
in
camp
.
when
compare
to
,
say
,
a
movie
studio
film
,
blade
squad
have
a
lot
in
common
with
a
term
which
share
its
initial
:
