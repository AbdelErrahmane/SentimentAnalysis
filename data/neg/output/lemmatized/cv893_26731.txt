i
go
to
blair
witch
project
2
:
book
of
shadow
with
the
highest
of
hope
.
the
original
film
,
release
last
summer
,
be
genuinely
scary
and
terrifying
;
i
hope
that
this
movie
would
live
up
to
its
predecessor
.
unfortunately
,
my
hope
be
soon
dash
.
as
the
movie
open
,
the
audience
be
show
pseudo-documentary
clip
of
burkittsville
,
maryland
resident
be
interview
about
the
sudden
tourist
influx
to
they
town
as
a
result
of
the
original
blair
witch
project
movie
.
it
be
a
mostly
humorous
,
self-aware
poke
at
the
media
hype
and
hysteria
surround
the
first
film
.
during
this
segment
,
we
be
introduce
to
the
protagonist
,
a
young
man
who
sell
blair
witch-related
memorabilia
from
he
website
.
the
movie
then
cut
to
a
title
that
inform
we
that
what
we
be
about
to
see
occur
one
year
previously
.
we
see
the
same
young
man
that
be
sell
blair
witch
paraphernalia
,
but
now
he
be
confine
in
a
mental
institution
the
sort
of
which
one
only
find
in
bad
horror
movie
.
we
see
he
have
some
sort
of
disgusting
white
goo
unconvincingly
force
down
he
nose
while
a
cigarette-smoking
doctor
luridly
leer
above
he
.
we
see
he
throw
himself
wildly
around
a
padded
room
;
we
see
he
cower
naked
in
a
shower
stall
as
a
fire
hose
be
turn
on
he
.
no
explanation
be
provide
for
why
he
be
in
the
mental
institution
;
in
fact
,
these
scene
be
barely
refer
to
again
.
i
have
a
sink
feeling
during
these
open
scene
;
generally
,
a
hospital
scene
that
be
set
with
poor
lighting
,
filthy
interior
,
and
evil
doctor
be
a
sure
sign
that
you
be
in
the
throe
of
a
truly
horrible
movie
.
the
movie
cut
again
,
this
time
to
the
present
.
the
young
man
,
whose
name
be
jeffrey
-lrb-
play
by
jeffrey
donovan
--
as
in
the
first
movie
,
the
character
name
be
identical
to
the
actor
'
name
,
although
this
movie
admit
up
front
that
it
be
fictional
,
so
there
be
no
reason
for
the
practice
this
time
around
-rrb-
,
be
round
up
a
group
of
people
that
he
will
be
lead
into
the
wood
that
weekend
for
the
''
blair
witch
hunt
,
''
which
be
a
promotional
gimmick
he
come
up
with
and
sell
on
he
website
.
we
meet
tristen
and
steven
,
a
young
couple
who
be
write
a
book
about
the
blair
witch
experience
.
steven
be
a
skeptic
,
believe
the
whole
thing
to
be
the
result
of
mass
hysteria
.
tristen
,
on
the
other
hand
,
believe
that
there
may
be
some
truth
to
the
rumor
of
supernatural
occurrence
.
she
be
wan
and
soft-spoken
;
she
complain
that
the
radio
be
play
too
loudly
.
-lrb-
she
also
complain
that
she
feel
nauseated
;
i
know
immediately
that
the
character
be
pregnant
,
and
my
intuition
be
confirm
a
few
scene
later
when
kim
psychomagically
suss
it
out
.
how
do
i
know
?
because
in
bad
movie
,
nauseated
woman
be
always
pregnant
.
-rrb-
the
fourth
member
of
they
party
be
erica
,
a
wiccan
with
flow
hair
and
wide
eye
who
want
to
prove
that
the
blair
witch
be
a
good
witch
,
not
evil
.
they
pick
up
the
fifth
and
final
team
member
in
a
cemetery
.
kim
be
dress
completely
in
black
,
have
extreme
goth-style
makeup
on
,
and
occasionally
display
seemingly
psychic
ability
,
but
otherwise
seem
to
be
the
most
intelligent
and
reasonable
person
out
of
the
entire
bunch
.
presumably
she
want
to
be
pick
up
in
the
cemetery
just
for
dramatic
effect
;
it
be
never
explain
.
the
party
of
five
head
off
into
the
wood
as
promise
.
they
reach
the
crumble
ruin
of
the
foundation
of
rustin
parr
's
house
and
set
up
camp
,
complete
with
extensive
video
equipment
with
which
to
record
the
night
's
event
.
there
be
a
brief
encounter
with
a
rival
blair
witch
tour
group
who
have
plan
to
camp
at
that
site
as
well
,
but
after
a
few
word
be
exchange
,
the
rival
group
huff
off
and
make
camp
elsewhere
.
the
movie
veer
off
at
this
point
to
spend
many
long
,
long
minute
show
the
drinking
party
that
ensue
after
the
sun
go
down
.
sexual
innuendo
be
toss
around
,
much
hard
liquor
,
beer
,
and
pot
be
consume
,
and
nothing
much
else
happen
.
this
would
be
a
great
point
to
get
up
and
go
to
the
bathroom
if
necessary
.
the
next
day
,
the
team
wake
up
and
discover
that
they
camera
equipment
have
be
completely
trash
,
and
that
steven
and
tristen
's
manuscript
paper
be
flutter
down
from
the
sky
in
shred
,
like
snow
.
the
videotape
be
miss
,
but
thanks
to
a
psychic
intuition
from
kim
,
they
discover
the
videotape
bury
underneath
the
foundation
of
the
house
,
''
right
where
the
original
blair
witch
tape
be
find
!
''
ooh
.
spooky
.
the
team
go
back
to
jeffrey
's
house
--
a
creepy
old
civil
war-era
warehouse
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
--
to
regroup
and
review
the
tape
.
they
soon
discover
that
the
tape
mysteriously
skip
five
hour
of
the
night
.
wacky
hijink
ensue
.
tristen
start
have
weird
dream
in
which
she
be
the
blair
witch
,
everybody
start
find
these
weird
rune-like
burn
mark
on
they
body
,
steven
and
erica
have
some
highly
disturbing
mutual
hallucination
,
and
everything
pretty
much
go
to
hell
in
a
handbasket
.
throughout
the
entire
ordeal
,
jeffrey
and
the
other
continue
to
scrutinize
the
videotape
,
which
seem
to
have
some
kind
of
weird
image
on
they
at
about
the
point
that
the
time
jump
;
eventually
tristen
wander
in
,
mutter
something
about
''
reverse
,
''
and
from
this
they
somehow
realize
that
they
have
to
play
the
tape
backwards
.
when
they
do
this
,
they
discover
what
really
happen
during
the
five
lose
hour
.
-lrb-
one
of
the
thing
they
see
on
the
videotape
be
footage
of
themselves
bury
the
videotape
.
okay
,
if
the
videotape
be
be
bury
,
then
how
be
they
record
themselves
...
oh
,
nevermind
.
-rrb-
this
movie
be
awful
.
simply
awful
.
the
character
be
broadly-drawn
caricature
that
be
never
allow
any
depth
or
development
.
erica
be
the
nature-loving
wiccan
.
tristen
be
the
weak
and
sympathetic
woman
.
steven
be
the
overbearing
asshole
.
kim
be
the
antisocial
goth
girl
.
old
,
tired
cliche
be
use
to
illustrate
these
caricature
.
how
do
we
know
tristen
be
weak
and
sympathetic
?
because
she
be
pregnant
!
how
do
we
know
kim
be
a
antisocial
goth
girl
?
because
she
wear
a
lot
of
eye
makeup
!
how
do
we
know
the
local
sheriff
be
a
bad
guy
?
because
he
have
jag
tooth
and
talk
like
he
be
straight
out
of
''
deliverance
''
!
this
be
weak
storytelling
at
its
worst
.
rather
than
take
the
time
to
flesh
out
the
character
and
make
they
truly
sympathetic
,
the
writer
choose
to
give
each
one
a
few
stereotypical
characteristic
,
in
a
attempt
to
use
some
cinematic
shorthand
and
thereby
skip
straight
to
the
action
.
it
do
not
work
.
on
top
of
be
poorly
develop
,
most
of
the
character
be
either
seriously
unlikable
or
patently
stupid
.
-lrb-
''
honey
,
you
just
have
a
miscarriage
out
in
the
wood
and
get
medical
attention
at
a
hospital
that
look
like
it
belong
in
a
bad
slasher
movie
.
let
's
get
on
a
plane
home
.
''
''
no
.
i
be
have
these
bizarre
nightmare
and
see
strange
vision
and
i
want
to
find
out
what
be
go
on
.
''
''
ok
.
''
-rrb-
frankly
,
by
the
end
of
the
movie
,
i
be
root
for
the
witch
.
i
also
feel
that
there
be
simply
too
much
blood
'n'
gore
in
this
film
.
the
first
movie
work
by
never
show
we
the
horror
.
the
witch
be
a
palpable
presence
in
that
movie
,
but
we
never
see
it
;
we
never
see
anything
,
in
fact
.
the
horror
be
all
off-screen
,
and
thus
we
imagination
work
overtime
to
envision
what
it
might
possibly
be
.
this
be
the
hallmark
of
a
truly
creepy
and
disturbing
horror
movie
.
blair
witch
2
dispense
with
such
nicety
and
go
straight
for
the
gross-out
.
this
be
evident
from
the
opening
scene
of
the
mad
doctor
force
white
goo
down
jeffrey
's
throat
,
and
continue
throughout
the
film
as
the
audience
be
treat
to
occasional
confusing
and
disorienting
footage
of
what
appear
to
be
a
ritual
massacre
of
some
sort
.
knife
plunge
into
flesh
,
bloody
finger
trail
off
into
the
darkness
,
and
none
of
it
be
explain
until
the
very
end
,
when
it
be
too
late
for
I
to
care
.
this
movie
do
not
stop
with
show
we
the
gore
,
either
;
it
go
for
break
and
show
we
everything
.
by
the
end
of
the
movie
,
there
be
no
question
remain
about
the
miss
five
hour
.
it
be
all
explain
;
in
fact
,
it
be
all
show
on-screen
in
loving
detail
.
i
confess
to
be
someone
who
prefer
horror
movie
in
which
you
never
see
the
monster
,
or
see
only
brief
glimpse
,
mere
suggestion
of
what
the
monster
be
;
it
be
not
because
i
find
the
monster
so
terrifying
,
but
because
i
find
the
absence
of
the
monster
to
be
infinitely
more
terrifying
.
i
have
see
interview
with
the
director
in
which
he
suggest
that
there
be
no
''
monster
,
''
that
all
of
the
evil
be
perpetrate
only
by
the
human
mind
.
i
find
this
to
be
a
miserably
poor
explanation
;
if
it
be
in
fact
the
director
's
intent
,
then
he
need
to
have
some
word
with
the
writer
,
because
it
be
not
make
clear
at
all
.
-lrb-
i
know
a
lot
of
people
who
like
to
go
to
party
and
get
drunk
and
stone
out
of
they
mind
;
none
of
they
have
ever
go
on
a
murderous
rampage
and
then
experience
mass
hallucination
with
a
group
of
other
people
for
the
next
week
or
so
.
and
if
there
be
no
witch
,
then
what
about
the
vanish
tree
?
the
snowfall
of
manuscript
paper
?
hm
?
-rrb-
blair
witch
2
:
book
of
shadow
be
a
horrible
movie
.
from
the
poorly-written
character
to
the
implausible
story
to
the
plot
inconsistency
to
the
gross-out
shot
,
it
be
a
bad
effort
through
and
through
.
