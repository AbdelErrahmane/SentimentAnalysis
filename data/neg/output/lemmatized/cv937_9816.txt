take
a
look
at
the
following
equation
...
a
christmas
carol
+
ghostbuster
=
scrooge
yes
,
scrooge
be
the
odd
mixture
of
sentiment
,
comedy
and
horror
you
would
get
if
you
mix
those
two
element
toghether
.
scrooge
be
alternatively
sick
,
gross
,
funny
,
and
then
sickly
soppy
.
bill
murray
play
frank
cross
,
a
t
.
v
executive
with
a
horrible
personality
.
he
be
evil
to
secretary
,
actor
,
crew
,
everyone
,
except
the
t
.
v
's
station
's
boss
,
of
course
-lrb-
play
by
the
late
robert
mitchum
-rrb-
however
,
he
be
then
visit
by
a
very
dead
exec
,
who
warn
cross
that
he
will
be
visit
by
three
ghost
,
past
,
present
and
future
-lrb-
who
be
call
the
ghost
of
yet
to
come
,
for
some
reason
-rrb-
sure
enough
,
they
arrive
,
show
cross
how
much
of
a
s
.
o
.
b
he
be
,
and
he
change
he
way
.
however
,
throughout
this
simple
plot
,
we
have
get
to
suffer
outlandish
special
effect
,
poor
comedy
,
and
a
very
,
very
mean
performance
from
bill
murray
.
frank
cross
be
not
`
funny
'
mean
,
he
be
just
mean
.
he
also
be
not
very
good
at
emotional
scene
,
and
totally
destroy
the
last
ten
minute
of
the
film
,
with
a
utterly
desperate
speech
say
how
great
christmas
be
,
and
how
he
have
change
.
however
,
the
support
cast
be
ok
,
with
good
performance
from
mitchum
,
allen
-lrb-
who
play
he
girlfriend
-rrb-
and
john
glover
-lrb-
who
play
cross
's
`
partner
'
-rrb-
the
ghost
of
christmas
past
be
not
that
bad
either
.
sadly
,
though
,
the
audience
have
to
suffer
25
minute
of
`
home
alone
'
style
violence
from
the
ghost
of
christmas
present
,
play
by
carol
kane
.
whoever
think
smack
that
kane
smack
murray
in
the
head
with
a
toaster
be
funny
,
should
be
fire
straight
away
.
and
the
audience
also
have
to
suffer
bobcat
goldthwait
-lrb-
the
guy
with
the
annoying
voice
in
police
academy
3
,
if
i
remeber
correctly
...
-rrb-
who
,
thankfully
,
dose
not
say
much
.
the
script
be
horrendous
.
michael
o'donaghue
churn
out
terrible
,
bad
taste
joke
-lrb-
which
i
guess
be
the
whole
point
really
-rrb-
then
change
direction
completely
to
emotional
scene
.
and
he
must
of
be
on
some
drug
when
he
write
the
final
ten
minute
,
which
be
awful
.
the
special
effect
look
nice
,
but
do
nothing
for
the
film
.
there
be
some
impressive
make
up
effect
also
.
the
music
be
also
good
,
which
be
score
by
danny
elfman
.
but
great
effect
and
make
up
do
not
make
a
great
film
.
scrooge
be
a
appaling
attempt
to
inject
some
christmas
spirit
into
the
audience
,
see
as
the
first
1
hour
20
minute
of
the
film
be
so
depressing
anyway
,
and
the
last
ten
minute
have
to
make
up
for
it
with
a
godawful
speech
.
why
do
not
cross
just
look
out
he
exec
window
,
and
ask
a
young
boy
to
buy
a
goose
for
he
?
overall
,
then
,
you
would
have
a
much
better
christmas
if
you
avoid
this
film
like
something
that
should
be
avoid
-lrb-
perhaps
a
plague
-rrb-
