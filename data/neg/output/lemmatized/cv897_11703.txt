comment
:
why
be
this
movie
call
possess
by
the
night
?
it
be
hard
to
speculate
.
most
of
this
film
take
place
during
the
day
,
and
the
only
thing
possess
anyone
be
a
icky
,
pulsating
,
bubble
brain
thingie
in
a
jar
.
in
case
you
have
not
pick
up
on
this
yet
,
possess
by
the
night
be
a
bottom-of-the-barrel
''
thriller
''
-lrb-
i
use
the
term
''
thriller
''
loosely
here
-rrb-
which
be
really
cheap
and
bad
.
the
plot
,
which
sound
like
a
cheesy
pulp
science
fiction
story
from
the
1950s
,
actually
serve
one
purpose
:
to
exploit
nude
woman
as
often
as
possible
.
write
a
movie
review
for
a
film
like
this
prove
oddly
challenging
.
there
be
really
not
much
to
say
.
the
acting
be
lousy
;
although
,
occasionally
,
the
attempt
at
act
be
so
absurd
that
they
garner
a
chuckle
or
two
from
the
audience
.
most
humorous
be
frank
sivero
,
who
play
murray
,
the
novelist
's
agent
.
he
be
so
horrible
in
this
role
that
one
can
not
help
but
be
amuse
.
the
plot
suck
.
nearly
half
the
film
be
devote
to
a
loser
loan
shark
who
want
out
of
the
profession
,
even
though
he
have
only
limited
relevance
to
the
movie
as
a
whole
.
the
dialogue
stink
.
a
loan
shark
,
for
instance
,
tell
another
how
much
he
love
bimbo
,
which
be
something
the
audience
really
do
not
need
to
know
.
everything
about
possess
by
the
night
be
second
rate
,
even
the
film
credit
.
as
the
name
of
the
not-so-talented
film
crew
scroll
by
at
the
end
,
joseph
scale
come
up
,
credit
as
be
''
assistsant
to
foley
artist
.
''
someone
could
have
use
a
editor
!
to
be
honest
,
the
film
be
basically
a
excuse
to
flash
frontal
nudity
and
show
some
sex
scene
.
playboy
playmate
shannon
tweed
,
after
all
,
be
the
star
here
.
i
suppose
that
if
one
want
this
sort
of
thing
,
he
would
like
this
movie
.
why
do
i
give
this
turkey
two
star
and
not
one
?
as
a
bad
movie
,
it
be
unintentionally
funny
enough
to
keep
someone
passingly
interested
in
the
film
.
if
you
feel
possess
to
see
possess
by
the
night
,
however
,
i
would
recommend
you
exorcise
this
impulse
and
watch
something
else
.
