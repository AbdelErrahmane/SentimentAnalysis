be
not
it
the
ultimate
sign
of
a
movie
's
cinematic
ineptitude
when
you
can
not
think
of
much
to
say
about
it
other
than
''
it
suck
''
?
one
of
the
first
official
year
2000
release
,
supernova
be
such
a
movie
.
i
can
not
seem
to
get
past
one-word
adjective
with
this
one
,
although
''
boring
,
''
''
stupid
''
and
''
absurd
''
do
not
amount
to
much
of
a
review
.
a
shame
.
i
would
have
be
able
to
save
myself
the
chore
of
desperately
try
to
elaborate
.
but
c'est
la
vie
.
here
go
nothing
.
i
'll
keep
it
short
.
i
suppose
the
first
bad
omen
for
supernova
come
when
director
walter
hill
-lrb-
48
hour
-rrb-
remove
he
name
from
the
movie
,
request
that
it
be
replace
with
the
pseudonym
thoma
lee
.
the
film
's
fate
be
seal
in
many
mind
when
struggle
studio
mgm
decline
to
screen
it
for
the
press
,
a
event
usually
signify
a
studio
's
lack
of
confidence
in
a
particular
movie
.
hill
's
and
mgm
's
action
be
prudent
.
when
the
captain
of
medical
space
vessel
nightingale
die
in
a
tragic
hyperjump
accident
,
a
reform
drug
addict
who
be
also
the
first
officer
,
for
some
reason
-lrb-
jame
spader
-rrb-
be
force
to
take
command
.
the
ship
pick
up
a
distress
call
from
a
nearby
planet
and
,
on
arrival
,
pick
up
one
survivor
from
a
apparent
accident
in
a
abandon
mining
colony
.
one
of
the
crew
member
-lrb-
angelum
bassett
-rrb-
know
this
passenger
,
who
be
play
by
peter
facinellus
,
and
have
some
bad
feeling
about
it
--
and
we
all
know
what
that
mean
.
this
intergalactic
hitchhiker
be
carry
some
mysterious
cargo
--
a
jellylike
substance
the
purpose
of
which
be
unknown
,
though
it
seem
to
bring
some
form
of
pleasure
to
whoever
touch
it
.
another
one
of
the
crew
member
experience
this
first
hand
;
after
spend
a
few
minute
partially
inside
this
glob
of
goo
,
he
do
some
impressive
handstand
pushup
.
evidently
,
touch
this
enigmatic
egg-shaped
thingie
make
you
younger
and
stronger
.
how
?
why
?
the
movie
never
bother
to
explain
.
soon
enough
though
,
spader
and
bassett
be
run
around
the
ship
like
mad
,
be
chase
by
the
all-of-a-sudden-superhuman
facinellus
.
to
be
honest
,
i
do
not
even
remember
exactly
why
.
i
just
remember
that
i
do
not
care
.
supernova
's
plot
suggest
some
more
or
less
interesting
idea
,
such
as
the
ball
of
goo
be
a
intergalactic
time
bomb
,
but
they
be
all
drop
before
they
have
a
chance
to
develop
into
anything
truly
intriguing
.
in
fact
,
everything
be
drop
just
so
the
actor
can
have
some
fun
run
around
what
look
like
a
elaborate
set
.
well
,
the
effect
be
good
,
though
there
be
hardly
a
studio
movie
with
bad
special
effect
these
day
so
i
be
not
sure
whether
that
be
so
remarkable
a
accomplishment
.
the
performance
be
hardly
worth
talk
about
.
i
be
not
even
sure
i
can
call
what
be
here
''
performance
,
''
though
angelum
bassett
sure
be
good
at
give
people
the
finger
.
jame
spader
be
not
a
bad
actor
,
but
he
prove
to
be
one
of
the
blandest
action
star
i
have
see
in
a
while
,
mostly
because
he
be
not
give
a
character
with
a
personality
.
the
action
scene
be
just
as
bland
,
since
they
be
pretty
much
just
rehash
of
action
element
that
be
not
particularly
entertain
the
first
time
around
.
and
since
the
action
scene
be
everything
to
this
movie
,
it
be
pretty
much
dead
in
the
water
.
and
for
the
life
of
I
,
i
can
not
figure
out
why
it
be
call
supernova
.
