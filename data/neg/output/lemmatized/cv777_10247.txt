when
walt
disney
picture
announce
a
live-action
feature
base
on
the
'60s
cartoon
series
of
''
mr
.
magoo
,
''
special
interest
group
represent
the
vision-impaired
let
out
a
cry
of
dismay
.
mr
.
magoo
,
they
claim
,
would
be
a
insult
to
the
man
and
woman
they
represent
.
in
fact
,
they
be
wrong
.
mr
.
magoo
be
not
just
a
insult
to
the
blind
and
near-blind
,
it
be
a
insult
to
every
human
being
who
have
the
misfortune
to
suffer
through
this
dreadfully
unfunny
,
90
minute
atrocity
.
it
be
state
the
obvious
to
remark
that
disney
appear
to
have
run
out
of
original
idea
.
look
at
they
roster
of
1996
and
1997
release
,
and
you
'll
see
a
shocking
list
of
retread
,
include
101
dalmatian
,
george
of
the
jungle
,
jungle2jungle
,
that
darn
cat
!
,
flubber
,
and
now
mr
.
magoo
.
the
best
of
these
-lrb-
george
of
the
jungle
-rrb-
be
mildly
entertaining
.
the
worst
,
mr
.
magoo
,
expose
just
how
painful
a
bad
movie
experience
can
be
.
the
first
problem
with
mr
.
magoo
be
the
script
.
despite
the
collaboration
of
naked
gun
scribe
pat
proft
,
mr
.
magoo
be
comically
barren
.
from
begin
to
end
,
there
be
not
a
laugh
to
be
find
.
every
attempt
at
humor
--
and
there
be
lot
of
they
--
fall
flat
with
a
audible
thud
.
you
would
think
that
out
of
the
dozen
of
gag
jam
into
this
film
,
at
least
a
few
would
work
,
but
that
be
not
the
case
.
i
have
have
more
laugh
during
ingmar
bergman
picture
.
then
there
be
leslie
nielsen
,
who
look
,
sound
,
and
act
absolutely
nothing
like
the
animated
character
-lrb-
memorably
voice
by
jim
backus
-rrb-
.
in
the
past
,
nielsen
have
prove
he
comic
aptitude
with
role
in
movie
like
airplane
and
the
naked
gun
.
lately
,
however
,
he
have
be
get
lazy
,
take
part
in
the
likes
of
draculum
:
dead
and
loving
it
,
spy
hard
,
and
mr
.
magoo
.
even
if
nielsen
be
in
top
form
,
it
would
take
a
incredible
stretch
of
imagination
to
see
he
as
magoo
-lrb-
especially
since
we
be
remind
of
the
original
by
the
short
cartoon
segment
that
open
and
close
the
film
-rrb-
,
but
''
top
form
''
be
not
a
phrase
i
would
use
to
describe
he
performance
here
.
this
be
strictly
a
take-the-money-and
-
run
operation
.
the
story
,
which
,
like
many
disney
story
,
can
be
describe
in
one
long
sentence
:
magoo
be
the
only
witness
to
the
theft
of
a
rare
jewel
from
a
museum
,
and
,
as
he
be
try
to
apprehend
the
thief
on
he
own
,
the
police
mistake
he
for
the
robber
.
the
cop
be
play
by
ernie
hudson
and
stephen
tobolowsky
,
who
take
they
lump
early
and
often
.
the
bad
guy
be
kelly
lynch
-lrb-
who
do
a
lot
of
martial
arts-type
kick
-rrb-
,
nick
chinlund
,
and
malcolm
mcdowell
-lrb-
who
have
the
good
sense
to
look
embarrassed
-rrb-
.
matt
keeslar
portray
one
of
magoo
's
sidekick
--
he
nephew
,
waldo
.
the
bumble
man
's
other
,
more
interesting
companion
be
a
dog
name
angus
.
most
of
mr
.
magoo
's
humor
come
in
the
form
of
fail
slapstick
.
the
cartoon
violence
level
in
this
film
do
not
approach
that
of
home
alone
3
or
flubber
,
but
it
be
still
pretty
acute
,
with
character
get
hit
on
the
head
with
sledgehammer
and
knock
off
snowy
precipice
.
there
be
a
non-violent
bit
with
magoo
prepare
a
chicken
dinner
that
could
have
be
funny
if
it
be
handle
better
,
but
,
compare
to
mr
.
bean
's
recent
,
similar
misadventure
,
it
do
not
hold
up
well
.
then
there
be
the
series
of
lame
joke
that
result
from
magoo
's
near
blindness
,
such
as
the
occasion
when
he
mistake
a
wild
animal
for
a
baby
.
i
be
willing
to
cut
director
stanley
tong
a
little
slack
.
tong
,
a
hong
kong
film
maker
try
to
break
into
the
hollywood
market
,
have
helm
several
jackie
chan
movie
,
include
first
strike
,
rumble
in
the
bronx
,
and
supercop
.
he
chief
talent
,
that
of
choreograph
martial
art
fight
,
be
waste
here
-lrb-
despite
some
high
kick
by
kelly
lynch
-rrb-
.
like
john
woo
-lrb-
hard
target
-rrb-
and
ringo
lam
-lrb-
maximum
risk
-rrb-
before
he
,
it
appear
that
tong
have
be
consign
to
the
purgatory
of
make
a
bad
movie
as
he
entry
into
the
american
mainstream
.
it
be
worth
note
that
,
unlike
many
disney
film
which
hold
a
perverse
appeal
for
the
under-10
crowd
while
drive
parent
to
distraction
,
mr
.
magoo
appear
to
bear
viewer
of
all
age
.
the
screening
i
attend
be
wall-to-wall
kid
,
and
,
for
the
most
part
,
they
do
not
seem
to
be
enjoy
themselves
.
when
the
film
be
over
,
i
ask
one
little
girl
what
she
think
of
it
.
she
pained
expression
confirm
the
adage
that
a
picture
can
indeed
be
worth
a
thousand
word
.
mr
.
magoo
be
the
kind
of
movie
that
should
be
reject
by
any
potential
viewer
,
sight
unseen
.
