''
soldier
''
,
by
director
paul
anderson
,
be
a
film
in
which
any
presence
of
originality
be
fleeting
.
the
best
moment
of
the
film
be
in
the
opning
scene
where
kurt
russel
's
character
todd
be
show
grow
up
under
strict
military
supervision
.
brutality
through
the
eye
of
the
innocent
and
strip
of
it
every
single
day
grow
up
be
something
that
have
a
lot
of
emotional
potential
power
behind
it
,
and
the
opening
scene
tap
into
it
a
little
.
then
it
go
nowhere
with
that
idea
.
there
be
perhaps
one
rather
fleeting
scene
afterwards
that
deal
with
the
potential
trauma
of
this
dehumanization
,
and
the
rest
of
the
film
be
just
some
of
the
biggest
action
movie
cliche
i
have
ever
see
.
the
whole
idea
of
the
inhuman
,
soldier-type
character
gain
some
degree
of
humanity
by
defend
a
potential
female
love
interest
and
family
from
he
evil
counterpart
out
to
kill
she
be
do
,
and
it
be
be
do
much
better
.
i
be
able
to
predict
the
plot
of
the
_
whole
_
story
,
which
would
not
be
so
bad
if
other
aspect
of
the
film
somewhat
interesting
.
between
the
action
sequence
,
it
try
to
deal
with
the
aforementioned
issue
of
humanity
through
the
performance
of
mr
.
russel
in
the
film
and
the
tiny
little
window
to
he
soul
that
be
he
eye
,
since
he
dialog
be
extremely
limit
.
he
performance
in
that
way
be
not
all
that
bad
,
but
certainly
be
not
enough
to
carry
this
film
.
other
performance
in
this
film
be
really
not
worth
much
mention
at
all
,
and
they
generally
be
about
as
weak
as
they
character
.
but
enough
of
this
stuff
about
plot
and
character
,
right
?
be
not
the
most
important
part
of
a
action
film
,
well
,
the
action
?
even
in
this
aspect
the
film
be
a
disappointment
.
in
mortal
kombat
-lrb-
1995
-rrb-
,
director
paul
anderson
prove
that
truly
engage
use
and
choreography
of
action
in
a
film
can
override
problem
with
plot
and
produce
something
entertaining
.
however
,
he
fail
to
repeat
that
in
this
film
.
the
combat
scene
,
particularly
the
big
one
at
the
end
,
be
incredibly
unimaginatve
.
fight
and
combat
scene
be
suppose
to
bring
about
thrill
in
this
type
of
movie
,
a
point
which
even
a
otherwise
unimpressive
film
like
starship
trooper
seem
to
realize
.
but
instead
of
reach
for
something
truly
interesting
to
end
the
film
with
,
it
go
for
the
old
,
shoot-em
up
,
one
guy
vs
.
a
army
type
of
cinema
that
i
think
die
with
the
military
action
film
of
the
80s
.
if
the
film
go
with
some
of
the
idea
it
open
up
with
the
introduction
more
seriously
,
it
could
have
be
a
rather
engaging
science
fiction
film
.
however
,
it
utterly
fail
to
go
in
any
new
direction
after
that
,
make
the
film
a
big
disappointment
.
