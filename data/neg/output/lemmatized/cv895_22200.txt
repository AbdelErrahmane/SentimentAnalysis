2
day
in
the
valley
be
more
or
less
a
pulp
fiction
knock
off
.
it
basically
involve
how
a
bunch
of
quirky
character
in
the
lo
angele
area
end
up
have
they
life
become
intertwine
in
some
very
unusual
way
.
i
be
not
go
into
much
greater
detail
than
that
,
since
it
would
take
forever
to
explain
,
and
quite
frankly
,
i
be
not
willing
to
spend
any
more
time
on
it
than
the
2
hour
that
i
have
already
waste
.
while
it
try
very
hard
to
be
pulp
fiction
,
2
day
in
the
valley
fall
way
short
.
this
be
quite
a
condemnation
consider
the
cast
include
danny
aiello
,
jame
spader
and
jeff
daniel
.
while
the
story
be
not
much
,
and
the
dialogue
and
character
rate
only
marginally
better
,
2
day
in
the
valley
do
have
a
couple
of
bright
spot
.
jame
spader
's
character
,
while
not
much
better
than
the
rest
,
be
at
least
fun
to
watch
in
a
sick
sort
of
way
.
and
we
do
get
to
see
a
nice
cat
fight
between
uber
babe
teri
hatcher
and
charlize
theron
-lrb-
in
she
first
role
-rrb-
.
you
know
a
movie
be
not
that
good
when
the
highlight
be
a
brawl
between
two
woman
.
even
if
they
be
both
gorgeous
.
i
will
give
the
writer
some
credit
for
the
fairly
clever
way
in
which
they
manage
to
intersect
the
life
of
this
group
of
character
that
would
have
otherwise
never
interact
.
but
marvel
at
that
ingenuity
be
a
far
cry
from
actually
enjoy
the
result
.
while
some
of
the
character
and
they
respective
story
be
fairly
interesting
,
they
inevitably
be
bring
down
as
they
intersect
with
the
other
half
of
the
character
that
i
really
care
absolutely
nothing
about
.
if
i
be
to
put
a
number
on
it
,
only
about
half
of
the
story
and
half
the
character
in
this
movie
be
particularly
interesting
or
otherwise
enjoyable
to
watch
.
this
be
the
sort
of
movie
that
only
a
huge
fan
of
one
or
more
of
the
cast
member
should
rent
,
and
even
then
prepare
for
disappointment
.
not
even
charlize
theron
be
naked
would
get
I
to
sit
through
this
movie
again
.
or
at
least
not
all
of
it
anyway
.
