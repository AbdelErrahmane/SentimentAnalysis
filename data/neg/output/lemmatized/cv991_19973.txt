the
king
and
i
,
a
warner
brother
animated
,
musical
feature
,
recycle
the
classic
story
of
a
woman
who
challenge
the
heart
of
a
king
,
with
obvious
result
.
when
anna
-lrb-
miranda
richardson
-rrb-
,
a
british
schoolteacher
,
travel
to
saim
to
educate
the
king
's
-lrb-
martin
vidnovic
-rrb-
child
,
she
learn
that
the
king
be
treat
he
people
unfairly
,
and
must
say
something
to
the
greedy
ruler
.
meanwhile
,
the
king
's
prime
minister
-lrb-
ian
richardson
-rrb-
,
the
stereotypical
villain
,
plot
to
overthrow
the
king
,
take
the
throne
.
the
last
,
and
most
predictable
,
main
subplot
deal
with
the
king
's
son
-lrb-
allen
d
.
hong
-rrb-
,
and
he
love
for
a
servant
,
tuptim
-lrb-
armi
arabe
-rrb-
,
and
how
he
conflict
with
he
feeling
,
and
the
ancient
law
of
saim
.
not
even
the
lone
strong
character
of
anna
can
save
the
unbelievably
horrible
waste
of
talent
,
as
the
king
and
i
's
problem
could
fill
the
blank
page
of
a
journal
.
i
will
only
note
the
major
difficulty
,
for
it
would
take
page
to
elaborate
on
every
detail
.
the
screenplay
,
write
by
arthur
rankin
,
peter
bakalian
,
jacqeline
feather
,
and
david
seidler
,
which
be
base
upon
the
play
write
by
richard
rodger
and
oscar
hammerstein
,
have
some
of
the
worst
dialogue
write
in
a
film
within
recent
memory
,
as
every
time
the
obnoxious
king
would
shout
,
''
etc
,
etc
,
etc
,
''
i
would
cringe
.
literally
.
speaking
of
cringe
-
i
do
quite
a
bit
of
this
during
the
rather
short
film
,
which
be
a
classic
display
of
terrible
filmmaking
.
besides
the
repetitive
dialogue
from
the
king
,
on
the
whole
,
the
song
seem
out
of
place
,
and
unlike
the
lyric
,
be
unmagical
.
the
sole
song
which
be
use
cleverly
be
''
get
to
know
you
,
''
which
be
use
as
anna
show
the
child
the
great
outdoors
,
which
they
have
never
be
expose
to
.
unlike
disney
animated
feature
,
the
king
and
i
's
song
do
not
add
to
the
film
,
and
be
as
uneffective
as
could
be
.
take
the
follow
scenario
as
a
example
,
as
the
sheer
horror
of
the
king
and
i
's
music
be
at
its
worst
.
you
be
be
hunt
by
a
dragon
!
what
do
you
do
!
?
sing
a
happy
song
!
martin
vidnovic
voice
the
king
without
effort
or
emotion
-
you
hear
the
say
two
negative
do
not
make
a
positive
?
believe
it
!
with
the
terrible
dialogue
that
the
king
have
,
along
with
he
awful
voice
track
,
the
king
be
completely
unbelievable
,
only
show
mild
sign
of
any
personality
,
and
the
only
thing
that
change
in
the
king
be
that
he
say
''
etc
.
,
etc
.
,
etc
.
,
''
more
and
more
as
the
film
progress
.
no
personality
at
the
beginning
of
the
movie
,
none
at
the
end
.
and
where
do
this
character
's
personality
change
?
hey
,
i
think
anna
be
suppose
to
change
he
!
be
not
that
the
whole
plot
?
the
prime
minister
's
hideous
sidekick
-lrb-
darrell
hammond
-rrb-
bring
he
share
of
cringe
as
well
-
oh
no
!
another
one
of
he
tooth
fall
out
!
hardy-har-har
!
he
be
suppose
to
bring
laugh
for
the
kidlet
,
but
even
at
age
five
i
would
have
cringe
while
watch
he
.
by
the
way
this
review
be
go
,
you
may
think
the
reasoning
for
my
hate
for
this
film
be
due
to
not
like
animated
film
-
hence
why
i
hate
this
movie
,
because
the
king
and
i
be
a
disgrace
to
animation
.
animated
film
,
such
as
1994
's
the
lion
king
and
1998
's
the
prince
of
egypt
,
be
among
my
favorite
movie
of
all
time
.
the
animation
team
do
design
they
share
of
well
animated
setting
,
so
this
make
it
easier
to
take
my
mind
off
of
the
annoying
king
,
until
i
realize
that
day
and
night
switch
back
in
fourth
within
seconds
.
i
have
not
read
the
play
,
or
see
the
oscar
winning
,
1956
film
adaption
,
but
from
what
i
can
tell
,
the
screenplay
for
the
1999
version
completely
butcher
the
play
,
for
the
king
and
i
be
never
magical
,
nor
interesting
.
if
it
be
not
for
miranda
richardson
,
who
voice
anna
with
feeling
,
the
king
and
i
could
earn
the
title
,
''
worst
movie
of
the
decade
.
''
instead
,
the
king
and
i
will
just
go
down
as
among
the
year
's
worst
.
the
bottom
line
-
avoid
this
movie
at
all
cost
.
not
even
young
child
,
the
target
audience
in
this
film
,
will
enjoy
it
.
not
the
slightest
bit
.
