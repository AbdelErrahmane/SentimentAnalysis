martial
art
master
steven
seagal
-lrb-
not
to
mention
director
!
-rrb-
have
build
a
career
out
of
play
a
allegedly
fictitious
martial
art
superman
who
never
get
hurt
in
fight
,
talk
in
a
hushed
tone
,
and
squint
at
any
sign
of
danger
.
he
be
also
the
most
consistent
individual
in
hollywood
today
,
since
all
he
movie
suck
.
they
basically
represent
he
egotisitical
tendency
about
he
art
-lrb-
that
be
,
martial
art
-rrb-
.
i
be
sure
the
guy
's
good
,
and
he
seem
like
a
nice
guy
on
talk
show
,
although
a
tad
haughty
,
but
these
movie
he
make
be
all
the
same
:
a
guy
who
be
basically
indestructable
,
be
maybe
wound
supposedly
mortally
,
then
come
back
with
a
vengeance
and
go
buddha
on
all
the
baddy
ass
-lrb-
although
i
kinda
like
''
under
siege
''
-rrb-
.
of
course
,
this
one
,
as
a
change
,
have
a
''
message
''
that
be
drill
into
we
mind
...
of
course
,
after
he
blow
up
a
lot
of
stuff
and
kill
a
bunch
of
people
.
so
why
do
i
watch
he
crap
?
i
usually
do
not
.
i
will
never
,
and
you
can
hold
I
to
this
,
i
will
never
pay
to
see
this
man
's
movie
,
unless
,
and
only
unless
,
he
be
in
a
support
role
-lrb-
i
.
e
.
''
executive
decision
''
-rrb-
and
i
would
definitely
pay
if
he
die
-lrb-
i
.
e
.
''
executive
decision
''
-rrb-
.
but
this
one
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
.
this
do
not
mean
it
be
good
or
that
i
even
like
it
.
this
be
the
last
movie
i
watch
with
my
deceased
uncle
,
and
we
have
one
hell
of
a
time
rip
it
apart
a
la
''
mystery
science
theater
3000
,
''
and
this
be
a
couple
year
before
i
have
hear
of
''
mystery
science
theater
3000
.
''
in
this
one
,
seagal
play
a
worker
for
a
mining
factory
set
in
alaska
and
run
by
the
greased-up
typical
shallow
villain
,
this
time
play
by
a
oscar-winner
to
give
the
movie
some
more
clout
-
michael
caine
.
it
seem
that
caine
want
to
do
something
with
he
oil
factory
that
include
he
dump
oil
all
over
inuit
land
.
around
the
20-30
minute
point
,
seagal
speak
up
to
he
in
what
seem
to
be
the
typical
speech
to
all
the
vain
entrepeneur
-lrb-
what
with
he
new
''
fire
down
below
,
''
another
''
message
film
''
-rrb-
,
and
caine
have
he
bump
off
...
or
do
he
?
seagal
be
rescue
by
some
inuit
,
and
fall
in
love
with
one
of
they
,
play
by
joan
chen
,
who
can
act
,
hypothetically
,
but
,
for
some
reason
,
not
here
.
one
of
caine
's
cliched
henchman
-lrb-
play
here
with
a
lot
of
overacting
by
john
c
.
mcginley
-rrb-
shoot
the
cheif
of
the
inuit
clan
,
and
chen
and
seagal
go
on
a
voyage
to
take
down
the
oil
factory
...
literally
,
of
course
.
at
one
point
,
seagal
give
a
wonderfully
hysterical
speech
about
how
he
do
not
have
any
option
but
blow
stuff
up
.
he
even
go
as
far
as
to
say
,
''
i
do
not
want
to
kill
someone
,
''
and
in
the
same
breath
,
he
ask
some
guy
where
the
arsenal
be
.
i
have
no
problem
with
violence
.
i
be
a
huge
john
woo
fan
,
but
he
paint
he
film
with
suspense
,
skill
,
style
,
depth
,
characterization
,
and
just
plain
cool
violence
.
in
the
film
of
seagal
,
the
suspense
mainly
consist
of
the
baddie
attack
he
stupidly
,
and
he
either
wound
or
kill
they
.
at
some
point
,
they
use
the
cliche
of
the
talk
villain
,
where
the
villain
have
the
advantage
,
can
shoot
seagal
,
but
begin
talk
by
either
tell
he
he
big
secret
plan
,
or
say
a
corny
line
,
to
which
seagal
say
something
hokey
back
,
and
have
have
enough
time
to
devise
of
a
way
to
do
away
with
they
,
and
do
.
this
would
be
okay
if
there
be
any
suspense
or
if
it
do
not
take
itself
seriously
at
all
,
like
in
the
case
of
this
summer
's
''
con
air
.
''
but
seagal
be
serious
about
he
skill
,
and
of
course
,
he
message
.
i
would
not
mind
if
this
be
a
message
film
in
the
way
that
they
present
it
to
you
with
evidence
.
but
seagal
have
no
idea
how
to
present
a
film
where
the
message
be
subtle
,
not
pound
into
the
viewer
's
mind
.
the
villain
be
totally
shallow
and
cartoonish
,
thus
we
can
not
take
he
and
he
motive
seriously
,
and
while
seagal
talk
about
be
kind
to
the
environment
,
he
also
go
ahead
and
blow
up
a
square
mile
of
rig
,
and
kill
some
worker
who
be
just
do
he
job
.
then
at
the
end
,
he
spend
a
good
10
minute
give
a
speech
,
just
in
case
you
do
not
get
the
message
from
the
trailer
.
what
seagal
do
not
realize
be
that
no
one
take
he
film
seriously
-lrb-
although
maybe
a
couple
do
-rrb-
and
any
message
he
have
be
no
only
redundant
,
but
do
not
comfortably
fit
in
he
film
,
which
be
fill
to
the
brim
with
hokey
violence
,
crap
suspense
,
stupid
melodrama
,
and
character
who
have
about
as
much
emotional
depth
as
a
petri
dish
.
as
far
as
seagal
and
he
act
,
he
be
rather
boring
.
he
squint
,
he
kill
.
period
.
nothing
else
.
oh
,
yeah
,
there
be
corny
one-liner
-lrb-
''
i
be
gonna
reach
out
and
touch
someone
!
''
-rrb-
.
of
course
,
he
be
the
star
,
and
we
be
suppose
to
root
for
he
and
all
,
so
he
make
all
the
villain
unbelievably
stupid
and
a
bunch
of
jerk
.
michael
caine
,
who
be
a
great
actor
,
be
just
suppose
to
yell
and
look
cold
.
he
do
it
well
,
i
guess
,
but
this
be
no
''
alfie
.
''
of
coure
,
no
one
be
expect
that
caliber
of
performance
from
he
.
he
big
henchman
,
john
c
.
mcginley
be
kinda
boring
as
well
,
but
be
not
horrible
.
and
we
even
get
a
small
performance
from
that
god
of
drill
sergeant
on
celluloid
,
r
.
lee
ermey
-lrb-
from
''
full
metal
jacket
''
-rrb-
as
a
hire
assasin
squad
leader
who
get
to
say
the
obligatory
speech
about
how
dangerous
seagal
be
,
just
for
the
movie
trailer
and
for
seagal
's
ego
.
and
also
,
look
for
billy
bob
thornton
as
one
of
ermey
's
assasin
.
anyway
,
to
conclude
this
all
,
to
judge
one
of
seagal
's
movie
be
to
judge
all
of
they
-lrb-
except
for
''
under
siege
''
and
''
executive
decision
,
''
though
the
latter
be
not
really
a
''
seagal
movie
''
-rrb-
.
they
all
have
this
same
formulum
,
they
all
have
the
same
action
,
same
villain
,
same
plot
,
but
this
one
have
that
message
,
which
make
it
more
excrucitate
to
watch
.
i
mean
,
if
you
do
rent
it
,
and
i
do
not
reccomend
you
do
,
make
sure
you
just
skip
the
last
10
minute
.
but
i
have
to
put
it
to
seagal
for
create
a
film
so
bad
,
that
the
last
film
i
view
with
my
uncle
be
a
pleasurable
one
.
my
-lrb-
extra
star
for
the
fun
it
be
to
watch
and
mock
-rrb-
