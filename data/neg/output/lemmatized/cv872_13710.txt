fact
that
charle
bronson
represent
one
of
the
most
important
movie
icon
of
the
1980s
represent
one
of
the
biggest
and
almost
tragic
irony
of
that
decade
.
tragedy
lie
in
the
fact
that
the
icon
status
be
earn
less
by
quality
of
he
work
in
movie
,
but
the
quantity
.
most
of
those
movie
be
produce
by
cannon
group
,
company
lead
by
israeli
producer
menahem
golan
and
yoram
globus
.
those
two
man
probably
think
that
they
could
be
the
next
roger
corman
,
b
-
movie
mentor
of
future
hollywood
legend
.
unfortunately
,
that
do
not
happen
,
and
when
cannon
finally
go
bankrupt
at
the
end
of
the
decade
,
behind
it
stand
the
huge
pile
of
cinematic
garbage
,
that
would
require
at
least
few
century
before
it
reach
the
camp
appeal
.
sadly
for
bronson
,
that
garbage
also
contain
numerous
movie
in
which
that
capable
character
actor
and
action
hero
of
the
1970s
try
to
raise
they
worth
simply
by
be
the
main
lead
,
and
lower
he
own
reputation
in
process
.
on
the
other
hand
,
bronson
could
take
comfort
in
a
fact
that
those
movie
be
extremely
popular
,
especially
among
the
audience
3
or
4
time
younger
than
bronson
himself
.
one
of
such
movie
that
seriously
mar
bronson
's
reputation
be
death
wish
3
,
third
sequel
in
the
series
which
begin
with
death
wish
in
1974
.
in
the
original
movie
,
bronson
play
paul
kersey
,
mild-mannered
new
york
architect
who
turn
into
deadly
street
vigilante
after
he
family
fall
victim
to
urban
violence
.
that
movie
be
far
from
masterpiece
;
yet
,
in
it
the
director
michael
winner
be
skillfully
offer
the
cinematic
remedy
for
very
real
disease
of
grow
crime
rate
of
the
time
-lrb-
on
the
same
line
like
siegel
in
dirty
harry
-rrb-
.
unfortunately
,
six
year
later
cannon
group
get
rights
to
the
character
of
paul
kersey
and
begin
destroy
it
by
pump
out
sequel
;
even
the
presence
of
its
original
director
do
not
stop
the
rapid
decline
of
the
quality
.
death
wish
3
begin
when
kersey
come
to
visit
a
old
friend
,
live
in
the
urban
wasteland
of
east
new
york
,
populate
by
young
criminal
and
people
too
old
or
too
poor
to
move
out
.
before
the
reunion
,
kersey
's
friend
fall
victim
to
the
street
gang
lead
by
evil
fraker
-lrb-
play
by
gavan
o'herlihy
,
probably
the
only
noteworthy
role
in
the
film
-rrb-
.
kersey
decide
to
avenge
he
death
and
slowly
prepare
for
he
crusade
,
while
the
police
inspector
shriker
-lrb-
ed
lauter
-rrb-
,
ant
to
use
he
as
a
secret
weapon
in
he
lose
war
against
the
urban
crime
.
bronson
,
the
main
asset
in
this
movie
,
play
the
character
who
be
nothing
more
than
a
efficient
killing
machine
.
although
bronson
's
charisma
do
help
in
overcome
some
implausibility
-lrb-
single
man
in
he
60
and
arm
with
a
single
pistol
manage
to
wipe
out
dozen
of
opponent
with
superior
firepower
-rrb-
,
the
lack
of
emotion
or
bronson
's
own
commitment
could
be
see
in
a
very
few
line
speak
in
a
film
.
the
movie
author
be
somewhat
aware
of
that
emotional
shallowness
,
so
they
add
romantic
interest
for
they
hero
-
public
defender
play
by
deborah
raffin
and
conveniently
terminate
in
order
to
give
some
more
motive
for
kersey
's
crusade
.
on
the
other
hand
,
emotion
be
much
better
play
by
confront
law-abiding
,
yet
ethnically
stereotyped
citizen
with
they
daily
nemesis
of
street
punk
-
ruthless
enough
to
exercise
they
reign
of
terror
on
the
entire
city
block
,
and
stupid
enough
to
be
kill
in
drove
by
kersey
.
unfortunately
,
michael
winner
do
not
know
how
to
work
out
the
plot
,
and
after
torture
the
viewer
with
mostly
uninteresting
character
and
cliched
and
formulaic
situation
,
end
this
movie
with
a
bang
.
the
big
showdown
at
the
end
-
that
turn
east
new
york
into
the
sarajevo-like
battle
zone
-
be
probably
the
worst
part
of
the
movie
,
because
of
the
poor
editing
and
the
cheap
set
and
prop
that
give
away
the
low
budget
.
in
short
,
this
movie
could
be
recommend
only
to
the
most
fanatical
charle
bronson
fan
or
for
the
people
who
be
already
desperate
for
1980s
nostalgia
.
