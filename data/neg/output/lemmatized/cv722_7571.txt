the
premise
of
this
movie
be
,
well
,
pretty
far-fetched
.
tom
berenger
play
shale
,
a
mercenary
who
be
temporarily
out
of
work
-lrb-
those
fool
at
the
cium
have
deny
he
existence
just
because
he
and
he
buddy
botch
a
job
in
cuba
-rrb-
.
fortunately
,
he
girl
friend
-lrb-
diane
venora
-rrb-
,
a
teacher
at
christopher
columbus
high
school
in
miamus
,
get
she
knee
cap
break
by
a
disgruntled
student
,
create
a
job
opening
for
shale
as
a
substitute
teacher
.
not
tell
he
girl
friend
,
who
might
object
on
pedagogical
grounds
,
he
create
a
number
of
fake
higher
degree
for
himself
-lrb-
from
yale
,
harvard
,
princeton
,
et
al
-rrb-
and
begin
he
tenure
as
a
high
school
teacher
.
the
student
-lrb-
junkie
,
drug
dealer
,
gang
member
,
sleazy
slut
,
ice-pick
wielder
...
you
get
the
picture
-rrb-
do
not
really
take
to
he
right
away
,
so
he
hit
one
in
the
face
with
a
can
and
break
a
few
finger
.
this
get
they
attention
to
a
certain
extent
,
so
he
tell
they
the
story
of
the
vietnam
war
:
''
see
,
some
homeboy
from
the
north
try
to
muscle
in
on
the
turf
of
the
homeboy
from
the
south
.
''
oh
yeah
,
now
they
can
dig
it
;
the
problem
be
just
that
nobody
ever
explain
it
properly
before
.
but
wait
!
there
be
drug
be
deal
in
the
school
itself
!
and
behind
the
whole
scheme
,
in
cahoots
with
the
head
gang
,
the
kod
-lrb-
no
,
not
''
cod
''
,
but
''
knight
of
destruction
''
...
really
!
-rrb-
,
be
none
other
than
...
the
upright
,
ex-cop
principal
,
play
by
the
forget
ghostbuster
,
ernie
hudson
!
so
shale
do
what
any
good
teacher
would
do
.
he
get
he
buddy
together
,
they
gather
together
a
bunch
of
bazooka
and
other
major
weapon
,
explosive
,
and
cool
stuff
like
that
,
and
they
have
a
big
showdown
against
the
drug
dealer
and
kod
at
the
high
school
.
ok
,
so
the
premise
be
not
just
far-fetched
,
it
be
downright
dumb
.
if
this
be
a
hong
kong
action
comedy
,
we
might
just
accept
it
,
but
it
take
itself
far
too
seriously
to
be
truly
fun
.
oh
,
it
have
its
moment
;
how
one
can
truly
hate
a
movie
in
which
huge
-lrb-
really
huge
-rrb-
amount
of
cocaine
be
deliver
in
school
bus
?
and
to
be
fair
,
it
be
almost
never
really
boring
,
as
the
action
be
interrupt
by
only
short
sequence
of
actual
story
.
but
over
all
,
this
be
pretty
much
a
made-for-tv
movie
with
more
-lrb-
and
bigger
-rrb-
explosion
and
more
foul
language
.
in
fact
,
it
remind
I
of
''
miamus
vice
''
without
the
production
value
,
babe
in
skimpy
bikini
,
and
pastel
.
if
you
can
sneak
into
the
theater
without
pay
,
go
for
it
.
otherwise
,
wait
for
video
.
the
fly
inkpot
rating
system
:
\*
wait
for
the
tv2
broadcast
.
\*
\*
a
little
creaky
,
but
still
better
than
stay
at
home
with
gotcha
!
\*
\*
\*
pretty
good
,
bring
a
friend
.
\*
\*
\*
\*
amazing
,
potent
stuff
.
\*
\*
\*
\*
\*
perfection
.
see
it
twice
.
