with
he
successful
book
and
movie
,
michael
crichton
be
do
well
.
with
early
success
with
westworld
-lrb-
1973
-rrb-
and
coma
-lrb-
1978
-rrb-
,
and
recent
film
such
as
jurassic
park
-lrb-
1993
-rrb-
,
he
film
have
be
entertaining
.
however
,
he
seem
to
take
a
wrong
turn
somewhere
with
sphere
.
this
$
100
million
mess
by
good
director
barry
levison
-lrb-
disclosure
-rrb-
be
dull
,
long
winded
,
and
a
huge
disappointment
.
consider
the
huge
budget
,
the
all
star
cast
,
and
a
story
by
crichton
,
sphere
be
majorly
disappointing
.
the
film
open
with
norman
goodman
-lrb-
hoffman
-rrb-
,
a
psychologist
who
think
he
be
visit
a
airplane
crash
to
console
the
survivor
.
however
,
when
he
arrive
,
he
he
tell
by
supervisor
barne
-lrb-
peter
coyote
-rrb-
that
he
be
actually
investigate
a
spacecraft
.
along
with
goodman
be
mathematician
harry
adam
-lrb-
jackson
-rrb-
,
biologist
beth
halperin
-lrb-
stone
-rrb-
and
ted
fielding
-lrb-
liev
schrieber
.
-rrb-
they
investigate
the
spaceship
,
find
a
massive
sphere
inside
,
meet
a
alien
intelligence
call
jerry
,
and
basically
weird
crap
happen
.
unfortunately
,
something
go
wrong
along
the
way
with
sphere
.
the
film
start
off
entertaining
enough
,
but
throughout
this
very
long
movie
,
it
just
get
sillier
and
sillier
.
the
film
jaunt
along
from
scene
to
scene
,
never
fully
explain
what
be
go
on
.
the
actor
and
direct
do
not
help
,
either
.
hoffman
be
on
autopilot
-lrb-
and
almost
seem
embarrassed
-rrb-
throughout
the
movie
,
churn
out
dull
line
,
and
probably
wonder
what
the
hell
he
be
do
in
this
movie
.
stone
be
useless
,
display
no
emotion
,
and
fail
to
convince
the
audience
that
she
have
any
feeling
for
hoffman
.
the
only
person
who
seem
to
be
have
fun
in
this
movie
be
jackson
,
who
be
funny
as
the
mathematician
who
slowly
go
crazy
and
enter
the
sphere
.
but
he
be
hardly
in
it
,
and
by
the
end
of
the
film
he
be
just
as
dull
as
hoffman
and
stone
.
the
same
go
for
peter
coyote
,
who
ham
it
up
as
the
officer
,
but
be
then
kill
off
halfway
through
.
the
director
,
barry
levinson
,
who
direct
the
better
crichton
adaptation
disclosure
-lrb-
1994
-rrb-
mess
up
with
the
drama
and
the
action
.
the
drama
scene
be
,
quite
frankly
,
boring
,
and
the
action
scene
suffer
from
overkill
,
with
levison
throw
the
camera
all
over
the
place
-lrb-
much
like
the
godawful
speed
2
,
1997
-rrb-
the
writing
do
not
help
much
,
either
.
although
crichton
be
great
with
plot
,
he
be
terrible
with
dialogue
,
and
practically
every
line
in
sphere
be
a
dud
.
the
speech
be
too
simple
,
i
be
hope
it
would
be
a
bit
more
intelligent
.
practically
every
line
be
just
state
the
obvious
.
none
of
it
be
smart
.
also
,
where
the
hell
do
the
budget
go
?
the
sphere
itself
be
impressive
,
and
there
be
a
few
nice
special
effect
shot
,
but
where
the
$
100
million
go
be
anyone
's
guess
.
there
be
a
giant
squid
attack
in
the
picture
,
but
not
once
do
the
audience
see
the
squid
,
even
though
the
film
have
a
massive
budget
.
i
assume
the
picture
be
try
to
build
up
tension
by
not
show
the
squid
,
and
if
handle
correctly
it
probably
would
.
but
the
whole
scene
be
do
badly
,
and
i
be
just
hope
we
could
see
the
stupid
squid
.
finally
,
the
film
have
no
idea
what
genre
to
be
.
levison
can
not
handle
he
own
plot
.
it
leap
from
hokey
sci-fus
,
to
horror
,
and
finally
the
shining\/event
horizon
psychological
thriller
.
and
,
of
course
,
the
film
be
very
much
like
the
abyss
-lrb-
1988
-rrb-
,
although
in
it
be
defense
,
crichton
do
write
sphere
before
the
abyss
be
release
-lrb-
and
be
far
superior
to
this
rubbish
.
-rrb-
it
be
not
all
that
bad
though
.
the
plot
be
all
right
,
there
be
a
few
jump
scene
-lrb-
although
nothing
very
scary
-rrb-
and
there
be
the
occasionally
interesting
bit
.
but
overall
,
sphere
be
a
big
waste
of
some
fine
talent
,
a
lot
of
money
,
and
a
potentially
good
movie
.
not
really
worth
see
.
