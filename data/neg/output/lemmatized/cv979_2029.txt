robin
hood
:
man
in
tights
be
another
mel-brooks-produced
film
in
the
classic
tradition
of
movie
like
blaze
saddle
and
young
frankenstein
.
mel
brook
be
well
know
for
he
comic
look
at
regular
life
,
he
fast
paced
dialogue
and
sharp
wit
.
unfortunately
,
robin
hood
:
man
in
tights
have
none
of
the
easy
go
humor
of
blaze
saddle
,
none
of
the
fun
acting
of
young
frankenstein
,
be
devoid
of
the
charm
of
spaceball
,
and
be
even
lack
the
good
,
solid
dialogue
of
history
of
the
world
.
it
be
,
in
short
,
one
of
the
worst
movie
i
have
see
mel
brook
,
or
anybody
else
,
produce
.
the
plot
borrow
heavily
from
the
well-received
kevin
costner
movie
of
last
year
,
robin
hood
:
prince
of
thief
.
this
be
not
surprising
in
and
of
itself
,
and
could
have
be
use
to
great
comic
effect
,
mainly
by
parody
scene
from
the
orginal
movie
.
mel
brook
do
not
take
advantage
of
this
,
however
,
and
use
the
film
to
launch
several
idea
into
the
air
,
none
of
which
connect
and
none
of
which
be
explain
later
on
.
the
movie
's
scene
could
be
shuffle
around
in
any
order
and
one
would
be
hard
press
to
notice
.
cary
elwe
,
of
princess
bride
fame
,
play
robin
of
loxley
,
a
man
who
be
capture
in
the
crusade
,
fight
with
king
richard
.
he
escape
and
,
join
with
a
man
name
achoo
-lrb-
i
be
sure
you
can
see
the
obvious
joke
-rrb-
,
fight
in
england
to
reclaim
he
name
and
the
throne
for
richard
,
which
have
be
capture
by
evil
prince
john
,
play
by
funny
comic
richard
lewi
.
he
also
try
for
the
love
of
maid
marian
and
attempt
to
overthrow
the
evil
''
sheriff
of
rottingham
''
.
a
good
adventure
plot
that
be
sadly
unused
.
elwe
and
lewi
be
both
excellent
comic
,
but
the
dialogue
in
the
movie
be
simply
excruciate
.
neither
actor
have
any
good
word
to
work
with
,
and
the
line
simply
be
not
funny
,
nor
believable
.
perhaps
the
worst
example
of
this
be
when
the
group
of
merry
man
encounter
a
man
play
a
macaulay
culkin
clone
from
the
hit
movie
home
alone
.
this
particular
scene
be
so
out
of
place
and
so
badly
act
,
and
follow
by
so
many
other
scene
of
equal
miserable
idea
,
that
i
really
feel
like
leave
the
theater
.
much
of
the
audience
continue
to
look
at
they
watch
throughout
,
and
some
leave
the
theater
.
chuckle
be
few
and
far
between
,
and
they
mostly
deal
with
visual
joke
-lrb-
such
as
a
old
,
beat
up
horse
from
''
rent-a-wreck
''
-rrb-
then
from
any
dialogue
whatsoever
.
scene
that
could
have
be
classic
,
such
as
the
archery
contest
,
be
ruin
by
poor
acting
.
perhaps
the
largest
problem
with
the
movie
be
that
it
be
simply
offensive
.
the
basic
plot
,
that
robin
have
receive
a
key
that
will
unlock
the
chastity
belt
of
maid
marian
,
be
not
witty
nor
funny
.
mel
brook
as
a
circumcision-giving
rabbi
be
also
offensive
to
I
and
other
in
the
audience
-lrb-
not
all
jewish
,
either
-rrb-
.
the
movie
simply
try
to
hard
try
to
be
funny
and
by
and
large
fail
.
the
addition
of
a
blind
man
who
stumble
around
,
fall
off
cliff
,
walk
into
ledge
and
be
a
general
buffoon
could
have
have
some
humorous
potential
,
but
be
also
make
terribly
offensive
.
the
only
reason
to
see
this
movie
be
the
surprise
actor
at
the
end
who
play
king
richard
.
he
be
well
worth
wait
for
,
if
you
can
stand
a
hour
and
half
of
unfunny
dialogue
,
excruciate
visual
humor
,
old
pun
,
ancient
joke
and
bad
acting
.
if
you
can
not
,
do
not
even
bother
watch
this
miserable
film
.
