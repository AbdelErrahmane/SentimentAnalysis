,
play
on
sentimental
string
and
mushy
dialogue
to
make
he
point
.
base
on
the
short
story
by
isaac
asimov
,
it
be
suppose
to
be
a
science
fiction
story
about
a
robot
who
want
to
be
human
,
which
as
you
can
imagine
be
very
difficult
.
start
in
a
not
too
distant
future
the
film
concentrate
on
a
wealthy
family
that
buy
a
android
to
help
they
with
the
house
and
child
.

interested
in
art
and
music
,
he
''
enjoy
''
make
clock
,
which
clearly
show
that
he
have
genuine
emotion
.
it
show
out
that
because
of
a
small
failure
in
the
''
electrical
circuit
''
and
''
positronic

''
andrew
have
accidentally
gain
a
soul
.
this
make

unique
and
he
evil
creator
worry
.
then
mr
.
martin
decide
to
teach

all
the
thing
he
be
not
program
to
do
.
soon
andrew
want
to
leave
the
house
in
pursuit
of
freedom
,
destiny
and
love
.
this
film
can
be
describe
as
a
disney
version
of
blade
runner
,
a
film
that
still
shine
as
the
biggest
gem
in
the
crown
of
science
fiction
.
ever
since
that
film
,
the
subject
of
humanity
still
stand
as
one
big
controversy
.
what
make
we
human
?
the
thought
?
the
emotion
?
be
it
possible
to
become
human
?
at
what
point
can
we
say
to
a
robot
''
now
you
be
one
of
we
''
?
these
be
very
tough
question
that
require
a
serious
and
thurral
approach
.
it
be
obvious
that
columbus
do
not
take
they
very
seriously
.
when
you
think
about
it
,
this
film
be
not
really
meditate
on
the
question
''
when
be
a
robot
no
longer
a
machine
,
but
a
human
be
?
''
,
but
tell
a
story
about
racial
discrimination
and
lack
of
understanding
.
andrew
be
so
complex
and
emotional
from
the
very
begin
that
the
audience
immediately
accept
he
as
a
human
being
,
and
only
the
society
have
trouble
with
it
.
in
other
word
,
it
be
as
far
from
reality
as
from
the
academy
award
.
further
more
,
there
be
other
annoying
problem
.
to
this
day
no
serious
filmmaker
have
dare
to
speculate
about
the
future
in
more
than
50
year
from
now
.
this
have
not
be
do
for
obvious
reason
,
because
the
filmmaker
be
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
lack
the
knowledge
and
imagination
to
perform
such
a
difficult
task
.
columbus
be
the
first
to
have
cross
that
line
.
the
result
be
,
as
you
might
imagine
,
primitive
,
unrealistic
and
incredibly
disappointing
effort
.
the
world
be
simply
freeze
in
time
.
neither
the
society
,
fashion
,
culture
or
value
have
change
over
200
year
.
mom
be
still
work
at
the
kitchen
,
do
the
dish
.
when
you
think
back
to
the
late
17th
century
and
then
compare
it
to
the
world
we
live
in
today
,
you
'll
see
a
slightly
bigger
difference
.
i
be
not
say
that
everything
should
change
.
it
be
unlikely
that
the
human
rights
will
change
,
but
it
be
even
more
unlikely
that
there
will
not
be
any
progress
in
science
,
technology
and
fashion
.
i
suppose
it
be
possible
to
watch
this
as
a
some
sort
of
bizarre
fairytale
,
but
it
be
really
hard
.
robin
william
be
hide
behind
c
and
speaking
in
a
robotic
way
.
as
always
he
do
a
decent
job
,
as
do
sam
neill
.
but
it
do
not
really
matter
.
it
be
the
sentimentality
and
length
that
turn
this
picture
into
a
tiresome
experience
.
pretty
much
like
last
year
's
''
meet
joe
black
''
,
this
be
a
primitive
and
unresolved
story
which
be
present
with
a
splendor
and
professionalism
that
it
do
not
deserve
.
great
actor
and
a
talented
crew
have
work
hard
to
achieve
something
that
will
be
instantly
forget
.
when
isaac
asimov
write
this
story
,
the
future
seem
far
away
and
magical
.
everything
seem
possible
.
now
be
the
future
of
asimov
's
time
,
and
we
know
that
it
be
not
as
magical
and
perfect
as
it
seem
a
long
time
ago
.
for
the
same
reason
that
the
young
generation
of
today
can
not
be
amaze
by
julius
verne
's
''
20
000
league
under
the
sea
''
,
so
can
not
we
accept
this
story
as
a
potential
reality
.
let
we
hope
that
next
year
's
''
a
.
i
.
''
will
be
more
rewarding
.
