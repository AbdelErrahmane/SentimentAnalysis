for
he
directoral
debut
,
gary
oldman
choose
a
highly
personal
family
drama
about
a
violent
,
alcoholic
husband
and
father
,
and
the
various
life
he
affect
.
but
while
the
character
,
place
and
event
may
have
special
meaning
to
the
writer-director
,
the
audience
be
leave
in
the
dark
.
the
center
of
this
tale
be
the
abusive
raymond
-lrb-
ray
winstone
-rrb-
,
and
the
film
focus
on
he
and
the
people
who
orbit
around
he
.
he
spend
he
day
hang
out
with
he
friend
at
pub
and
girlie
bar
.
then
,
he
return
home
to
he
pregnant
wife
,
valerie
-lrb-
kathy
burke
-rrb-
and
they
five-year-old
daughter
.
raymond
demonstrate
he
violent
tendency
-lrb-
and
he
paranoid
delusion
-rrb-
early
on
when
he
accuse
valerie
's
brother
,
billy
-lrb-
charlie
creed-mile
-rrb-
,
of
steal
.
raymond
then
proceed
to
beat
-lrb-
and
bite
-rrb-
he
to
a
bloody
wreck
.
but
these
be
the
least
of
billy
's
problem
.
billy
be
a
heroin
addict
on
the
downturn
,
and
it
do
not
seem
that
he
'll
last
much
longer
.
billy
and
valerie
's
mother
,
janet
-lrb-
lailum
morse
-rrb-
,
be
raymond
's
nemesis
.
she
disapprove
of
he
-lrb-
and
he
of
she
-rrb-
,
but
be
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it
.
she
merely
struggle
on
,
hope
she
child
will
survive
they
respective
torment
.
if
this
description
seem
bleak
,
i
have
not
tell
the
half
of
it
.
this
be
not
a
cheery
movie
,
and
most
of
the
time
it
be
downright
depressing
.
while
at
time
it
be
interesting
to
watch
to
see
just
what
make
raymond
tick
,
and
why
no
one
ever
simply
call
the
cop
on
he
,
in
the
end
,
it
be
not
quite
worth
it
.
there
be
too
many
scene
which
randomly
dot
the
picture
with
little
or
no
purpose
.
take
for
example
the
extended
sequence
where
one
of
billy
's
scuzzy
friend
defend
a
stray
puppy
.
the
film
be
fill
with
these
''
character
moment
''
that
never
really
achieve
anything
.
grant
,
there
be
a
few
genuinely
powerful
-lrb-
and
sickening
-rrb-
moment
in
the
film
,
but
they
expression
seem
to
be
more
of
a
catharsis
for
the
creator
than
we
.
the
actor
do
a
fine
job
,
particularly
in
the
central
role
.
the
good
thing
about
a
actor
turn
writer
be
that
oldman
know
how
to
write
good
scene
,
and
the
actor
in
nil
by
mouth
have
some
meat
they
can
tear
into
.
the
bad
thing
about
a
actor
turn
director
be
that
there
be
no
one
to
restrain
oldman
from
make
poor
choice
.
a
good
character
drama
should
mean
something
to
those
involve
in
make
the
film
and
the
audience
.
oldman
get
it
about
half
right
.
