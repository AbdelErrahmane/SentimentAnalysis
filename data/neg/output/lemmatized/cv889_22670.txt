of

sometimes
we
do

we
read
,
they
pick

''
hmmm
.
after
a
few
visit
to
the
prison
,
they
become
convinced
of
rubin
's
innocence
and
launch
they
own
full-scale
investigation
even
though
two
jury
have
convict
he
.
they
meticulously
go
through
all
the
file
and
revisit
all
the
old
witness
-lrb-
i
wonder
if
any
of
they
might
be
cranky
old
woman
who
slam
the
door
in
they
face
?
-rrb-
and
in
the
course
of
they
relentlessy
tedious
sleuthing
uncover
obvious
evidence
confirm
the
hurricane
's
innocence
that
be
either
ignore
or
never
seek
out
during
the
first
two
proceedings
.
of
course
,
we
be
already
tell
that
he
be
innocent
.
a
movie
like
this
be
especially
frustrating
because
we
be
not
be
show
everything
significant
that
happen
to
carter
during
this
period
in
he
life
.
all
too
obviously
,
we
be
get
the
hollywood
water
-
down
version
.
that
would
be
ok
except
that
the
part
we
be
get
be
milk
for
every
single
drop
of
melodrama
that
the
filmmaker
could
possibly
squeeze
out
of
it
.
it
be
almost
cruel
.
the
melodrama
be
not
of
the
entertaining
kind
either
;
it
be
the
hokey
,
rammed-down-your-throat
variety
where
every
emotion
be
exaggerate
to
the
point
of
absurdity
.
witness
the
villain
ferociously
grind
he
tooth
at
the
final
trial
or
the
constant
pseudo-saintliness
of
we
four
protagonist
.
the
hurricane
be
you
basic
courtroom
movie
except
it
be
a
no-frills
courtroom
movie
.
it
be
formulum
strip
to
the
bare
necessity
.
you
have
you
wrongly
accuse
black
man
.
you
have
you
melodramatic
final
courtroom
scene
.
but
there
be
nothing
else
.
you
would
expect
some
sort
of
involve
investigation
.
but
that
be
not
necessary
since
we
be
implicitly
inform
of
he
innocence
.
thus
the
whole
middle
portion
of
the
movie
be
reduce
to
the
protagonist
brooding
.
brood
to
himself
.
brood
to
other
inmate
.
brood
to
lesra
.
brood
to
lesra
's
canadian
friend
.
brood
in
letter
.
i
do
not
think
i
'll
ever
look
at
brood
the
same
way
again
.
it
be
not
long
before
i
get
tire
of
hear
the
hurricane
's
exceedingly
deep
meditation
on
he
condition
.
i
want
something
to
happen
.
as
for
washington
's
performance
in
the
title
role
--
i
figure
i
would
have
to
address
it
sooner
or
later
consider
the
amount
of
attention
it
be
receive
--
he
be
top
notch
,
though
still
bore
.
how
be
that
possible
?
well
,
he
do
what
jewison
want
he
to
do
perfectly
.
unfortunately
what
jewison
ask
he
to
do
be
a
load
of
crap
.
what
a
waste
of
a
great
performer
.
speaking
of
waste
,
why
the
hell
do
john
hannah
agree
to
do
this
?
he
be
a
extremely
talented
actor
and
i
love
he
dearly
,
but
what
be
he
do
here
?
to
call
he
character
-lrb-
along
with
schreiber
's
and
unger
's
-rrb-
a
stick
figure
would
be
a
gross
understatement
.
all
three
of
they
come
off
as
veritable
mother
theresa
,
as
benevolent
as
do-gooder
come
.
if
they
be
to
play
a
major
part
in
this
movie
,
why
not
make
they
real
people
,
with
real
feeling
and
emotion
?
look
:
if
you
be
go
to
make
a
formulum
movie
,
do
not
undermine
the
formulum
.
courtroom
drama
can
be
fun
,
but
this
be
ridiculous
.
not
only
be
it
trite
,
it
be
boring
.
