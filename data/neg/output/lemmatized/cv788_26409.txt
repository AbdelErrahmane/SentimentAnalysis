remember
back
in
the
mid
1990s
when
crime
and
macabre
movie
be
all
the
rage
?
''
pulp
fiction
''
and
''
fargo
''
both
manage
to
get
oscar
nomination
for
the
best
picture
,
and
not
surprisingly
,
a
slew
of
rip-off
follow
in
the
year
thereafter
.
that
fad
seem
to
be
over
but
here
come
christopher
mcquarrie
write
and
direct
''
the
way
of
the
gun
''
that
at
first
glance
look
like
another
of
those
wanna-be
's
but
upon
closer
inspection
do
not
look
like
anything
comprehendable
.
it
be
a
crime
story
so
wrap
up
in
its
own
little
world
it
have
a
claustrophobic
atmosphere
-
a
film
that
will
not
allow
the
story
much
room
to
expand
outside
its
handful
of
character
and
somehow
still
manage
to
turn
a
simple
premise
into
something
so
complex
its
ridiculous
.
complexity
should
come
as
no
surprise
to
anyone
who
be
familiar
with
mcquarrie
,
he
write
''
the
usual
suspect
,
''
which
have
become
a
cult
favorite
despite
little
critical
acclaim
.
that
film
have
a
great
story
and
be
well
direct
but
have
such
a
elaborate
,
confusing
screenplay
it
leave
many
viewer
scratch
they
head
after
repeat
viewing
.
you
have
to
wonder
if
mcquarrie
really
have
everything
map
out
or
if
he
be
go
for
the
hollywood
idea
that
''
if
it
be
really
confusing
and
about
criminal
and
cop
that
make
it
fascinating
.
''
with
''
the
way
of
the
gun
''
mcquarrie
seem
to
be
capitalize
on
the
same
idea
,
but
this
time
the
story
be
far
less
commercial
-
a
shame
because
maybe
that
would
have
help
.
the
film
tell
the
story
of
two
drifter
with
no
ambition
and
barely
a
reason
to
live
but
be
not
hell-bent
on
death
either
-lrb-
play
by
ryan
phillipie
and
benecio
del
toro
-rrb-
.
they
get
lucky
when
they
hear
about
a
scheme
between
a
big-shot
exec
guy
and
he
trophy
wife
who
be
go
to
have
a
baby
through
in
vitro
fertilization
.
they
figure
they
can
kidnap
the
surrogate
mother
-lrb-
play
by
juliette
lewi
-rrb-
and
get
a
nice
ransom
.
along
the
way
we
continually
learn
of
the
shady
dealings
between
the
exec
,
he
wife
,
they
hire
goon
and
the
''
bag
man
''
-lrb-
play
by
jame
caan
-
the
only
actor
in
the
film
who
look
like
he
know
what
he
be
do
-rrb-
.
the
exec
be
some
kind
of
money
launderer
so
he
obviously
can
not
call
the
authority
for
help
.
he
goon
and
the
bag
man
be
on
the
kidnapper
'
trail
and
each
make
different
offer
to
get
the
mother
back
.
the
exec
's
son
be
a
doctor
who
also
get
pull
into
the
fray
and
want
to
make
sure
he
patient
be
all
right
.
meanwhile
each
of
these
character
have
something
hide
up
they
collective
sleeve
and
the
double-cross
,
secret
love
affair
and
torrid
past
come
as
no
surprise
even
though
little
of
it
have
any
relevance
at
all
.
mcquarrie
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
simple
.
he
seem
to
be
more
interested
in
show
we
how
clever
he
be
than
make
a
good
movie
.
everything
have
to
be
complicate
and
confusing
,
so
much
so
that
it
be
to
the
point
of
surrealism
.
nothing
be
what
it
seem
in
this
reality
,
it
be
one
of
those
movie
where
you
get
drop
right
into
the
middle
of
the
criminal
world
and
be
expect
to
know
most
of
the
industry
's
rule
and
regulation
.
every
scene
with
caan
's
character
exemplify
this
perfectly
-
the
kidnapper
already
know
who
he
be
and
even
chat
with
he
,
get
into
conversation
about
''
the
business
''
and
how
it
work
and
we
be
hardly
give
a
clue
as
to
what
they
be
talk
about
.
these
character
be
probably
suppose
to
be
great
criminal
sketch
but
they
be
more
like
idea
ripped-off
from
sketch
find
in
david
mamet
's
trash
.
no
one
here
really
act
like
a
real
person
,
and
the
story
be
even
further
remove
from
reality
.
it
be
like
a
dream
without
any
appeal
.
take
the
opening
scene
for
example
;
the
phillipe
and
del
toro
character
be
in
a
parking
lot
across
the
street
from
a
bar
or
a
club
count
they
money
and
stuff
.
they
sit
on
a
brand-new
mercedes
and
the
car
alarm
go
off
,
the
owner
be
wait
in
line
and
yell
at
they
to
get
away
from
he
car
but
they
do
not
move
.
the
guy
and
he
loud-mouth
,
potty-mouth
girlfriend
and
about
20
other
people
cross
the
street
and
gang
up
on
they
.
you
would
think
phillipe
?
and
del
toro
be
?
go
to
pull
out
gun
and
scare
they
away
but
they
do
not
,
instead
phillipe
throw
one
punch
and
the
two
get
beat
down
by
a
mob
.
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
i
do
not
understand
about
this
scene
:
first
of
all
the
owner
of
the
mercedes
be
not
some
yuppie
or
old
rich
snob
,
he
be
like
a
hippie
straight
out
of
the
60
.
secondly
,
the
two
main
character
seem
to
believe
that
they
can
actually
take
on
the
mob
unarmed
.
lastly
,
it
serve
no
purpose
in
the
long
run
because
later
in
the
film
the
two
be
pack
more
artillery
than
a
small
country
's
army
.
if
they
be
suicidal
they
would
not
have
go
on
the
kidnapping
job
in
the
first
place
-lrb-
and
where
they
get
all
those
gun
be
never
explain
either
-rrb-
.
there
be
a
lot
more
i
could
pick
apart
about
this
film
but
that
would
be
a
exercise
in
futility
.
what
it
all
come
down
to
be
that
nothing
here
be
what
it
seem
-
which
would
be
great
if
this
movie
be
about
pretty
much
any
other
story
than
what
it
be
.
absolutely
none
of
the
character
be
likable
or
believable
.
and
it
be
all
coated
with
a
thin
layer
of
black
comedy
which
be
good
for
a
chuckle
here
and
there
but
this
film
be
definitely
not
a
flat-out
black
comedy
and
its
use
of
such
seem
like
a
desperate
attempt
to
kill
screen
time
.
with
any
film
you
see
,
whether
you
like
it
or
not
,
you
can
at
least
understand
what
the
appeal
be
to
it
,
why
someone
would
want
to
make
it
and
why
someone
would
want
to
see
it
.
i
can
not
say
either
for
''
the
way
of
the
gun
,
''
because
it
have
very
little
go
for
it
and
i
can
not
imagine
anyone
intelligently
defend
it
.
