,
it
be
the
rider

for
murder
,
this
be
all-too
typical
of
summer
release
.
all
style
and
no
substance
.
and
there
be
really
not
much
style
.
director
andrew
davi
-lrb-
the
accomplished
witness
and
best-forgotten
other
film
-rrb-
have
make
exactly
the
wrong
choice
at
almost
every
turn
.
dougla
and
paltrow
have
both
show
we
that
they
be
skillful
actor
in
previous
film
.
mortensen
show
promise
in
the
past
.
here
all
three
be
walk
uninterestingly
through
they
role
with
oddly
waxen
face
.
the
only
person
who
show
any
sense
of
life
be
david
suchet
as
new
york
detective
mohame
karaman
.
he
be
only
on-screen
long
enough
to
make
you
think
that
there
might
be
a
likable
person
in
the
film
and
then
he
disappear
.
the
first
concern
of
a
suspense
film
be
to
create
suspense
.
surprise
be
important
.
in
this
movie
the
audience
keep
wait
for
something
to
happen
.
and
nothing
ever
do
.
nearly
every
event
be
telegraph
in
advance
.
close-up
on
this
object
or
that
action
and
it
be
easy
to
guess
what
be
go
to
happen
.
as
the
film
plod
towards
its
inevitable
conclusion
you
keep
expect
a
plot
twist
to
make
the
movie
worthwhile
.
it
be
a
hopeless
quest
.
the
story
do
not
make
much
sense
.
steven
's
wife
be
load
.
even
with
unfriendly
relation
,
you
would
think
that
he
could
have
talk
to
she
about
he
difficulty
rather
than
decide
to
kill
she
.
when
he
do
decide
on
the
dire
plan
he
make
a
unreasonable
choice
.
if
you
be
go
to
hire
someone
to
kill
you
wife
,
would
you
first
choice
be
she
lover
?
no
matter
how
sleazy
he
be
,
i
would
think
there
might
be
a
chance
that
he
would
turn
down
the
opportunity
.
why
would
steven
plan
the
murder
as
a
break-in
in
they
apartment
?
why
not
just
take
she
out
as
she
be
walk
to
david
's
loft
in
a
bad
neighborhood
?
while
decide
among
the
numerous
summer
film
,
you
might
do
well
to
skip
this
one
.
you
'll
find
more
suspense
than
this
movie
offer
by
watch
the
weather
channel
.
