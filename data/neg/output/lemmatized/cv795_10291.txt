mr
.
bean
,
a
bumble
security
guard
from
england
be
send
to
la
to
help
with
the
grandiose
homecoming
of
a
masterpiece
american
painting
.
the
first
two
word
should
have
say
enough
to
let
you
know
what
occur
during
bean
's
trip
to
la
,
but
if
they
do
not
look
out
because
you
be
in
for
a
rather
interesting
if
not
odd
ride
.
heck
depend
on
you
humor
you
might
end
up
laugh
through
the
whole
flick
.
either
way
look
out
america
bean
be
come
.
well
,
what
can
really
be
say
about
this
movie
,
there
be
very
little
discernible
plot
.
that
much
be
not
hard
to
grapple
with
for
it
be
a
slapstick
comedy
.
it
achieve
that
goal
rather
admirably
,
but
because
it
be
that
,
the
plot
be
just
scream
for
help
.
the
whole
premise
that
the
movie
be
base
on
be
to
say
the
least
flaw
.
the
movie
have
its
funny
moment
but
there
be
no
real
story
line
other
than
something
that
could
be
think
up
on
a
whim
and
carry
through
and
in
many
cause
ad-libbed
as
you
go
.
do
not
go
into
this
movie
expect
and
theatrical
masterpiece
.
but
if
this
form
of
humor
float
you
boat
then
you
will
truly
enjoy
this
movie
,
even
if
you
do
not
like
slapstick
style
humor
you
will
end
up
laugh
because
something
's
be
just
so
stupid
.
the
movie
go
out
and
accomplish
what
it
aim
,
or
so
it
seem
.
now
when
you
look
at
the
act
in
this
movie
you
have
to
think
about
two
thing
,
first
be
there
any
real
acting
and
how
hard
be
it
to
act
in
the
slapstick
manner
.
well
,
there
be
no
real
act
in
this
movie
but
some
of
the
slapstick
be
not
the
easiest
i
be
sure
.
i
have
to
concede
that
mr
.
atkinson
's
act
in
this
movie
be
well
do
.
although
the
role
be
not
too
demand
the
slapstick
be
.
i
think
that
the
character
could
have
have
a
bit
more
dialogue
,
it
would
have
add
quite
a
bit
to
the
overall
effect
of
the
movie
.
now
the
rest
of
the
actor
in
the
movie
,
bad
act
and
poor
casting
.
i
think
that
the
role
opposite
bean
could
have
be
better
,
just
seem
wrong
for
the
movie
.
a
different
actor
might
have
do
a
better
job
of
it
but
i
wont
presume
that
be
not
what
be
try
to
be
achieve
.
one
thing
that
i
must
say
,
simply
to
get
if
off
my
chest
be
that
i
think
transfer
a
sitcom
to
tv
usually
produce
rather
disastrous
result
.
tv
show
should
do
just
that
stay
on
tv
,
it
will
probably
save
some
producer
from
get
ulcer
.
i
can
only
think
of
a
couple
example
of
tv
go
to
the
big
screen
effectively
,
the
best
know
of
those
would
have
to
be
star
trek
.
bean
seriously
fail
to
accomplish
anything
close
to
what
that
series
go
movie
achieve
.
now
another
thing
that
i
have
to
state
again
be
this
movie
have
narrow
its
target
audience
fairly
tightly
.
the
form
of
humor
in
this
movie
will
not
be
like
by
most
people
,
these
people
will
think
like
i
do
that
this
movie
be
stupid
and
pointless
.
but
if
you
like
the
tv
show
you
might
actually
like
this
movie
.
but
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
be
opt
to
recommend
you
save
you
money
and
not
go
to
see
this
movie
.
there
be
many
movie
that
be
truly
worth
see
unlike
this
one
.
