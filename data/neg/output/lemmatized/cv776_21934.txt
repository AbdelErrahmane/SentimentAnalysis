the
most
depressing
thing
about
the
depressingly
pedestrian
jame
bond
film
''
the
world
be
not
enough
''
be
its
final
frame
:
white
letter
on
a
black
background
proclaim
''
jame
bond
will
return
.
''
oh
i
certainly
hope
not
.
with
pierce
brosnan
in
he
third
and
reportedly
last
go-round
as
jame
bond
007
,
''
the
world
be
not
enough
''
be
the
best
example
to
date
that
''
`
enough
''
be
enough
.
in
this
,
the
19th
chapter
in
the
seemingly-endless
franchise
feature
ian
fleming
's
debonair
british
secret
agent
who
like
he
martini
--
and
he
nemesis
--
shake
not
stir
,
the
sub-inspired
screenwriter
have
choose
to
rehash
all
of
the
setup
,
stunt
,
and
sexy
encounter
of
the
previous
18
bond
flick
rather
than
come
up
with
anything
the
slightest
bit
original
.
we
have
get
previously-used
speedboat
chase
,
ski
chase
,
and
sticky
situation
aboard
nuclear
submarine
.
we
have
get
a
couple
of
hot-to-trot
babe
without
a
ounce
of
act
ability
between
they
.
we
have
get
a
post-cold
war
megalomaniac
bent
on
world
domination
slash
destruction
-lrb-
here
play
by
a
skinhead
robert
carlyle
with
mean
,
lean
panache
-rrb-
.
and
,
as
have
be
the
case
since
1977
's
''
the
spy
who
love
I
,
''
we
have
get
a
plot
that
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
anything
conceive
by
mr
.
fleming
.
we
have
also
get
a
main
title
song
by
garbage
to
which
,
with
very
little
effort
,
you
can
fit
the
lyric
to
\*
both
\*
song
from
''
tomorrow
never
die
.
''
while
originality
be
never
the
series
'
strong
suit
,
the
film
be
almost
always
fun
,
with
at
least
some
thought
go
into
the
nonstop
stunt
.
i
can
not
think
of
one
memorable
set-piece
in
the
entire
--
and
very
dull
--
''
the
world
be
not

and
the
''
28up

series
-rrb-
take
embarrassing
advantage
of
the
full
range
of
bond
clich
?
s
.
you
get
the
''
talk
killer
''
plot
device
--
you
know
the
scenario
:
the
bad
guy
have
the
good
guy
at
he
mercy
yet
wax
poetic
just
long
enough
to
die
of
old
age
.
and
you
get
a
slew
of
high-priced
assassin
who
can
not
hit
a
barn
door
at
20
pace
:
in
the
film
's
open
minute
-lrb-
of
a
endless
128

,
bond
chase
a
sultry
sniper
along
the
thame

the
leather-clad
lovely
fail
to
hit
