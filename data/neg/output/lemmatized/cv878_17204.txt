the
corruptor
be
a
big
silly
mess
of
a
action
movie
,
complete
with
pointless
plot
turn
and
gratuitous
violence
.
it
be
not
abhorrent
,
or
even
blatantly
unlikable
,
but
it
do
not
make
a
shred
of
sense
.
and
whose
idea
be
it
to
have
the
director
of
glengarry
glen
ross
direct
a
action
film
?
jame
foley
know
a
lot
about
character
and
act
,
and
those
be
the
strength
of
the
corruptor
.
but
the
quiet
scene
clash
with
the
ludicrous
action
nonsense
,
and
the
result
be
less
like
a
movie
and
more
like
a
derail
train
.
at
least
we
have
chow
yun-fat
in
the
lead
role
.
chow
play
nick
chen
,
a
chinatown
cop
.
he
be
a
good
cop
,
as
the
first
few
scene
establish
,
and
he
be
very
familiar
with
chinatown
.
that
be
probably
why
the
powers-that-be
decide
to
team
he
up
with
a
rookie
name
danny
wallace
-lrb-
mark
wahlberg
-rrb-
.
nick
and
danny
begin
by
step
on
each
other
's
toe
,
but
finally
end
up
liking
each
other
once
they
both
get
a
chance
to
save
the
other
one
's
life
.
what
happen
after
that
be
kind
of
a
mystery
to
I
.
i
be
fairly
certain
that
the
villain
be
all
part
of
the
fukienese
dragon
,
lead
by
a
young
chinese
psycho
name
bobby
vu
-lrb-
byron
mann
-rrb-
.
i
be
also
pretty
sure
that
nick
be
on
the
payroll
of
henry
lee
-lrb-
ric
young
-rrb-
,
a
gangster
deal
in
prostitute
and
other
neat
stuff
.
i
be
not
quite
sure
why
henry
lee
decide
to
employ
danny
,
although
this
make
for
some
ridiculous
-lrb-
albeit
unpredictable
-rrb-
plot
twist
along
the
way
.
there
be
also
a
interesting
subplot
revolve
around
danny
's
father
-lrb-
brian
cox
-rrb-
,
but
it
do
not
have
much
to
do
with
the
main
story
.
one
of
the
problem
,
as
i
say
,
be
that
the
movie
do
not
make
any
sense
.
i
do
not
blame
this
entirely
on
foley
,
because
he
be
obviously
a
good
director
.
i
be
more
inclined
to
point
my
finger
at
robert
puccus
's
script
,
which
do
not
seem
to
be
in
tune
to
the
way
normal
people
act
.
one
scene
early
on
have
I
particularly
annoy
:
nick
confront
he
boss
because
he
be
angry
about
he
new
white
partner
.
he
be
shout
and
point
he
finger
and
step
on
the
furniture
,
and
i
be
think
that
i
would
have
fire
he
if
he
have
do
that
to
I
.
-lrb-
in
addition
,
the
film
take
a
bite
into
race-related
issue
,
and
never
develop
they
at
all
.
-rrb-
there
be
a
lot
of
scene
like
this
one
,
and
none
of
they
be
very
coherent
.
there
be
also
a
considerable
language
barrier
,
give
that
chow
and
some
of
the
other
actor
have
thick
chinese
accent
.
the
plot
itself
never
straighten
out
.
i
be
not
sure
who
or
what
the
fukienese
dragon
be
,
or
why
henry
lee
be
associate
with
they
,
or
what
they
do
as
a
group
.
the
corruptor
be
a
action
movie
,
and
so
all
these
weird
plot
development
be
decorate
with
loud
and
violent
action
sequence
.
the
sequence
be
not
bad
,
but
they
be
not
new
;
how
many
car
chase
through
chinatown
have
you
see
?
on
that
note
,
how
many
chinatown
cop
movie
have
you
see
?
one
too
many
,
i
would
imagine
.
foley
's
strength
be
clearly
in
characterization
,
and
he
do
a
pretty
good
job
here
.
the
scene
between
nick
and
danny
be
very
good
,
and
i
actually
get
a
feel
for
they
character
;
a
bond
form
between
they
that
hold
part
of
the
film
together
.
chow
and
wahlberg
be
both
good
actor
;
chow
be
a
pro
,
and
can
do
this
kind
of
stuff
in
he
sleep
.
wahlberg
seem
less
at
home
in
this
atmosphere
,
but
he
be
still
fun
to
watch
.
i
also
like
the
subplot
involve
danny
's
father
;
brian
cox
's
performance
be
powerful
,
and
he
character
make
a
compelling
moral
compass
for
danny
.
but
the
film
ultimately
fail
,
mostly
at
the
hand
of
insane
incoherence
and
overly-familiar
action
scene
.
a
complicated
plot
can
be
successful
,
but
the
story
need
to
make
sense
when
it
be
over
.
the
corruptor
never
manage
to
make
any
sense
--
it
just
keep
spin
out
of
control
until
,
finally
,
there
be
nothing
leave
to
hold
on
to
.
