stallone
attempt
to
`
act
'
in
this
cop
drama
.
the
film
be
set
in
a
neighborhood
pratically
build
by
kietal
,
who
be
nephew
-lrb-
play
by
michael
rappaport
-rrb-
be
involve
in
a
car
crash
and
killing
of
two
black
youth
.
keital
dose
not
really
want
to
get
involve
in
anything
,
get
rid
of
rappaport
,
and
stallone
and
de
niro
try
to
work
out
what
the
hell
be
go
on
.
this
film
should
be
brilliant
.
it
sound
like
a
great
plot
,
the
actor
be
first
grade
,
and
the
support
cast
be
good
aswell
,
and
stallone
be
attempt
to
deliver
a
good
performance
.
however
,
it
can
not
hold
up
.
although
the
acting
be
fantastic
-lrb-
even
stallone
be
not
bad
-rrb-
the
directing
and
story
be
dull
and
long
wind
some
scene
go
on
for
too
long
,
with
nothing
really
happen
in
they
.
in
fact
,
the
only
scene
that
do
work
be
action
scene
,
which
i
suspect
stallone
be
try
to
avoid
.
in
this
film
,
serious
means
dull
.
the
dialogue
be
warble
,
and
basically
just
repeat
the
same
point
over
and
over
,
no
matter
who
be
deliver
they
.
the
plot
,
which
have
potential
,
be
waste
,
again
just
be
cliched
after
a
while
.
in
fact
,
the
only
thing
that
do
keep
the
film
go
be
kietal
and
de
niro
,
both
deliver
they
usual
good
performance
.
however
,
stallone
,
although
not
give
much
to
say
,
give
a
good
performance
.
however
,
it
be
not
all
that
bad
.
as
say
above
,
the
action
scene
be
well
do
.
there
also
a
very
good
ending
,
which
use
the
cinema
sound
system
well
.
in
fact
,
the
last
10
minute
of
this
2
hour
film
be
one
of
the
best
ending
of
1997
.
if
only
the
rest
of
the
film
be
as
good
as
the
end
.
cop
land
,
then
,
turn
out
not
to
be
a
power
house
film
,
but
a
rather
dull
,
and
not
every
exciting
film
.
hugely
disappointing
,
and
i
can
not
really
recommend
it
.
