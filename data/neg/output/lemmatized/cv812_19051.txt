that
reside
in
he
head
,
and
must
now
escape

bad
guy
who
be
after
that
very
important
information
.
since
he

''
hard
drive

,
he
be
also
race
against
the
clock
before
the

seep
into

.
critique
:
incoherent
,
boring
,
one-act
drivel
with
no
suspense
,
horribly
unbelievable
futuristic
environment
,
bad
dialogue
,
career-defining
bad
acting
by
keanu
reeve
and
a
hilarious
ending
.
it
be
too
bad
because
the
premise
of
the
film
be
interesting
,
but
unfortunately
for
my
friend
and
i
,
this
movie
turn
out
to
be
just
as
bad
as
everyone
have
warn
we
.
it
be
one
of
those
film
that
make
you
start
laugh
half-way
through
,
when
you
realize
that
most
of
the
actor
in
it
suck
,
the
location
shot
be
film
in
dark
''
junkyard
''
type
area
which
they
would
like
to
have
we
believe
to
be
futuristic
-lrb-
whatever
...
-rrb-
,
and
all
the
set
look
like
...
well
,
set
.
there
be
also
absolutely
no
arc
to
this
story
.
it
basically
start
off
with
keanu
upload
info
into
he
brain
,
and
then
a
bunch
of
folk
chase
he
from
place
to
place
until
a
laughable
end
put
a
stop
to
the
former
uneventful
proceedings
.
gibson
should
stick
to
write
novel
and
''
x-files
''
episode
,
since
he
segue
into
the
paranormal
tv
series
be
much
more
entertaining
than
any
of
this
garbage
.
some
other
hilarity
of
this
film
include
dolph
lundgren
as
some
futuristic
jesus
character
whose
suppose
to
kick
ass
,
henry
rollin
as
a
pumped-up
cyber-doctor
or
something
,
and
ice-t
as
some
kind
of
a
hobo
dude
with
paint
all
over
he
face
-lrb-
do
not
ask
-rrb-
.
the
end
be
the
funniest
with
some
robot
dolphin
and
a
stupid
ghost-lady
from
inside
the
computer
do
some
stuff
that
no
one
really
care
about
by
that
point
.
i
be
ashamed
to
say
this
film
be
shoot
in
my
hometown
of
montreal
,
canada
,
but
sadly
enough
for
we
all
,
it
be
.
some
of
the
cyber-travelling
special
effect
be
okay
-lrb-
hence
,
the
2\/10
-rrb-
,
but
overall
,
it
be
one
of
those
bad
movie
that
be
just
funny
to
watch
and
cringe
at
.
thankfully
for
keanu
,
he
redeem
he
sci-fi
career
with
1999
's
the
matrix
-lrb-
7
.
5\/10
-rrb-
.
it
be
too
bad
that
he
have
yet
to
redeem
he
lack
of
act
talent
.
