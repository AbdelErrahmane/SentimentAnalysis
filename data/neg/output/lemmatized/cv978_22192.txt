anna
and
the
king
be
at
least
the
fourth
film
adaptation
of
margaret
landon
's
fact
base
novel
the
king
and
i
,
and
it
be
big
,
expensive
and
soulless
.
though
good-looking
,
its
lavish
set
,
fancy
costume
and
luscious
cinematography
can
do
little
to
compensate
for
the
emotional
wasteland
that
be
peter
krike
and
steve
meerson
's
script
.
so
much
money
be
spend
on
pretty
picture
that
they
forget
to
actually
make
the
movie
interesting
.
this
be
jodie
foster
's
first
movie
since
the
jaw-droppingly
brilliant
contact
come
out
more
than
two
year
ago
and
it
be
not
the
best
choice
to
show
off
she
act
chop
.
she
be
trap
in
the
stoic
role
of
anna
leonowen
,
the
uptight
,
widow
british
schoolteacher
who
come
to
siam
-lrb-
now
thailand
-rrb-
with
she
son
to
instruct
the
king
's
-lrb-
chow
yun-fat
-rrb-
son
in
the
way
of
the
west
-lrb-
because
''
the
way
of
england
be
the
way
of
the
world
-rrb-
.
the
king
like
she
so
much
he
put
she
in
charge
of
educate
the
whole
royal
family
-lrb-
58
kid
with
10
more
in
the
way
;
impressive
,
no
?
-rrb-
.
the
eldest
prince
be
none
too
happy
about
this
-lrb-
''
father
,
have
i
offended
you
in
some
way
?
why
do
you
punish
I
with
imperialist
schoolteacher
?
-rrb-
,
but
soon
get
to
know
anna
and
she
stern
-
mother-who-loves-you
personality
better
and
come
to
like
she
.
meanwhile
,
siam
come
under
attack
from
the
neighbor
british
colony
of
burma
.
the
king
and
he
close
advisor
suspect
that
this
be
britain
's
do
which
arouse
suspicion
in
siam
,
put
anna
in
a
uncomfortable
position
.
she
be
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
and
seem
to
herself
suspect
british
involvement
in
the
crisis
but
work
to
diffuse
the
king
's
prejudice
.
he
,
though
self-righteous
as
ever
,
can
not
help
but
be
influence
by
the
eloquent
anna
and
they
slowly
,
quietly
,
develop
affection
for
each
other
.
there
be
a
scene
in
the
middle
of
anna
and
the
king
where
one
of
the
king
's
younger
daughter
die
.
it
be
you
classic
deathbed
scene
,
with
the
girl
's
mournful
eye
stare
at
she
father
,
who
try
only
semi
-
successfully
to
maintain
he
composure
.
anna
then
come
in
and
cry
a
bit
.
the
sequence
be
there
for
a
purpose
:
to
evoke
a
strong
emotional
response
from
the
viewer
.
i
be
usually
a
sucker
for
such
scene
and
yet
this
time
,
i
be
just
sit
there
,
my
emotion
untouched
.
this
remain
true
through
all
of
the
movie
which
remain
emotionally
barren
.
we
never
develop
connection
to
the
character
;
never
give
a
reason
to
care
.
this
ludicrously
long
epic
be
direct
by
andy
tennant
,
whose
last
film
be
ever
after
,
one
of
my
favorite
of
1998
.
i
do
not
doubt
tennant
's
ability
to
put
together
a
decent
movie
,
but
anna
and
the
king
,
aside
from
be
psychologically
inept
be
also
technologically
deficient
.
the
set
and
scenery
be
gorgeous
,
but
the
camerawork
do
nothing
to
convey
its
grandeur
.
even
terrence
malick
manage
to
do
more
with
flora
and
fauna
in
he
otherwise
abysmal
the
thin
red
line
than
tennant
can
muster
from
$
75
million
worth
of
prop
and
a
shoot
in
malaysium
.
we
feel
like
the
camera
be
restricted
to
its
immediate
point
of
view
;
there
be
no
wide
tracking
shot
or
sweeping
zoom
to
fill
we
with
larger-than-life
awe
.
i
like
both
foster
and
yun-fat
,
who
give
entertaining
if
not
terribly
involve
performance
in
the
two
lead
role
.
foster
's
generally
stoic
persona
serve
she
well
here
,
as
she
be
play
a
reserve
,
formal
and
rather
underdeveloped
character
.
yun-fat
be
especially
effective
,
perfectly
convey
the
king
of
siam
's
sangfroid
permeate
with
violent
outburst
.
what
do
anna
and
the
king
in
be
its
inability
to
involve
the
viewer
in
its
character
and
situation
.
the
cast
be
great
,
the
director
be
talented
,
and
the
budget
be
lavish
,
but
this
ill-advised
remake
of
the
classic
roger
and
hammerstein
movie
be
unable
to
utilize
any
of
those
thing
to
form
a
compelling
whole
.
this
be
a
emotionless
costume
epic
.
