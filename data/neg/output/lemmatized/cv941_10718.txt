there
have
be
so
many
movie
deal
with
organize

that
it
must
be
hard
to
write

.
this
movie
be
not
original
at
all
.
in
fact
,
i
be
anger
by
how
many
similarity
there
be
between
this
film
and
,
arguably
,
the
best
gangster
movie
of
all
time
,
the
godfather
.
if
you
be
go
to
borrow
idea
from
another
movie
and
not
give
credit
,
why
not
borrow
from
a
lesser
known
movie
-lrb-
say
,
miller
cross
?
-rrb-
.
how
could
the
credit
screenwriter
chri
brancato
not
give
credit
to
mario
puzo
himself
?
here
be
just
some
of
the
major
similarity

.
the
setup
in
this
movie
be
do
rather
well
.
i
enjoy
the
portrayal
of
the
network
of
''
runner
''
sprint
through
the
street
collect
bet
for
the
queen
lottery
.
this
be
the
way
of
life
in
harlem
,
and
most
people
involve
with
the
queen
do
so
because
it
be
the
only
way
to
support
they
family
and
put
food
on
the
table
.
number
running
be
the
only
way
for
the
harlem
population
to
find
work
.
i
also
enjoy
the
interaction
between
the
angry
,
violent
dutch
and
the
calm
,
patient
lucky
.
after
about
the
30-40
minute
mark
all
of
the
similarity
with
the
godfather
start
appear
,
one
after
the
other
-lrb-
and
in
short
order
-rrb-
.
it
be
a
huge
distraction
,
and
a
insult
to
my
intelligence
.
who
be
the
screenwriter
kidding
here
?
some
of
the
individual
performance
be
well
do
.
andy
garcium
be
very
convincing
as
lucky
,
unfortunately
he
screen
time
be
reduce
to
a
support
role
.
tim
roth
effectively
play
the
cocky
villain
,
much
like
he
role
in
''
the
cook
,
the
thief
,
he
wife
and
she
lover
''
and
''
rob
roy
''
.
the
good
performance
and
convincing
setup
during
the
first
third
of
the
movie
do
not
make
up
for
the
lackluster
story
that
follow
.
a
couple
of
coincidence
be
one
thing
,
over
a
dozen
be
a
insult
