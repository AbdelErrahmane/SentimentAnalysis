try
to
accomplish
with
this

there
be
no
sense
of
where
the
film
be
go
,
or
any
kind
of
coherent
narrative
.
if
there
be
a
point
to
the

i
miss

and
she
try
to

at

time

function
as
a
point
of
stability
,
as
he
watch
she
become
seduce
by
the
lurid
world
of
phone
sex
.
the
soundtrack
,
consist
of
song
by
prince
,
be
jarring
.
it
keep
take
my
attention
from
the
film
-
not
altogether
a
bad
thing
,
i
'll
grant
you
,
as
what
be
transpire
onscreen
be
not
that
riveting
.
for
part
of
the
middle
of
the
film
,
the
music
stay
blissfully
in
the
background
.
in
the
opening
sequence
and
one
scene
later
in
the
film
,
however
,
the
music
be
particularly
loud
and
distracting
.
of
course
,
i
have
never
really
care
for
prince
's
-lrb-
or
tafkap
if
you
like
-rrb-
music
.
prince
fan
might
love
the
soundtrack
,
but
it
will
probably
be
distracting
,
even
to
die-hard
fan
.
of
the
performance
,
the
only
one
that
stand
out
be
spike
lee
's
buddy
character
,
jimmy
.
he
be
excellent
as
the
always-broke
neighbor
of
girl
6
.
he
should
have
stick
to
act
in
this
film
.
there
be
several
sequence
that
give
I
the
impression
that
he
would
like
to
be
oliver
stone
when
he
grow
up
.
there
be
scene
shoot
with
different
type
of
film
,
which
be
purposely
grainy
,
and
reminiscent
of
some
of
the
scene
in
oliver
stone
's
natural
bear
killer
.
in
that
film
,
they
work
to
propel
the
narrative
.
in
this
film
,
they
just
make
I
more
confused
.
there
be
some
amusing
moment
,
and
a
few
insight
into
the
life
of
the
woman
who
use
they
voice
to
make
the
phone-sex
industry
the
multi-billion
dollar
industry
that
it
have
become
.
other
than
that
,
though
,
nothing
much
happen
.
there
be
a
few
intense
moment
,
as
when
one
caller
become
frightening
,
but
even
that
be
rather
lackluster
.
i
be
not
the
biggest
fan
of
spike
lee
,
though
i
would
agree
that
he
have
do
some
very
good
work
in
the
past
.
in
girl
6
,
though
,
he
seem
to
be
flounder
.
he
have
a
interesting
idea
,
a
fairly
good
setup
,
and
seem
to
wander
aimlessly
from
there
.
