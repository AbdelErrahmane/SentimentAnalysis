you
know
something
,
christmas
be
not
about
present
.
it
be
about
over-hyped
holiday
film
with
lot
of
merchandising
and
product
tie-in
.
at
least
that
would
seem
to
be
the
message
of
''
the
grinch
,
''
which
have
be
advertise
since
last
christmas
and
whose
logo
be
currently
plaster
all
over

.
hollywood
expect
we
to
ignore
this
cynical
greed
as
the
movie
scold
we
about
lose
the
true
spirit
of
the
season
.
you
know
the
plot
:
there
be
this
evil
furry
green
guy
call
the
grinch
-lrb-
jim
carrey
-rrb-
who
live
on
a
mountain
overlook
whoville
.
down
below
all
the
who
be
prepare
for
they
whobilation
,
but
the
grinch
be
determine
to
steal
they
christmas
.
the
movie
be
,
of
course
,
a
live-action
version
of
the
beloved
child
's
book
,
which
be
previously
adapt
into
a
1966
tv
special
by
looney
tune
animator
chuck
jone
.
it
be
rare
that
a
big
budget
hollywood
release
be
shame
by
a
thirty-year-old
half-hour
cartoon
,
but
that
be
the
case
when
jone
'
version
be
compare
to
ron
howard
's
.
the
tv
grinch
hit
all
the
right
note
:
bori
karloff
's
soft
,
deep
narration
;
thurl
ravenscroft
singing
''
mr

''
;
max
the
dog
weigh
down
by
the
gigantic
antler
tie
to
he
head
;
and
the
grinch
's
wide
,
toothless
grin
.
by
contrast
,
the
movie
hit
one
sour
note
after
another
.
first
,
there
be
the
numerous
bad
choice
that
jeffrey
price
and
peter
seaman
make
in
padding
out
the
short
book
into
a
105-minute
movie

during

she

to
sympathize
with

out
to

the

and
want
he
to
steal

the
grinch
be
not
even
the
villain
here
;
that
role
be
fill
by
the
corrupt
mayor
of
whoville
-lrb-
jeffrey

-rrb-
who
be
the
grinch

rival
for

not
only
be
the
character
needlessly
complex
,
but
the
once-simple
plot
become
so
convoluted
that
the
actual
theft
of
christmas
seem
like
a
afterthought
.
the
casting
choice
be
not
any
better
than
the
screenwriting
decision
.
jim
carrey
seem
woefully
miscast
.
while
he
face
be
so
supple
that
the
rubber
make-up
seem
superfluous
,
carrey
bring
nothing
else
to
the
role
.
he
accent
keep

;
i
assume
he
be
shoot
for
karloff
,
but
he
end
up

a
weird
slurry
of
richard

what
else
to
do
during

needless
to
say
,
he
wise-cracking
antic
do
not
quite
fit
the
character
of
the

,
who
be
a
embittered
loner

with
hate
