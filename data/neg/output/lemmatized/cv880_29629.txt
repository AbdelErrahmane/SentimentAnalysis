the
art
of
woo
attempt
to
be
one
of
those
film
like
breakfast
at
tiffany
's
in
which
the
audience
be
root
for
some
sweet
,
vulnerable
,
irresistible
woman
to
work
out
she
problem
and
to
find
happiness
.
the
problem
be
that
helen
lee
who
write
and
direct
seem
to
have
write
alessa
woo
-lrb-
play
by
sook-yin
lee
-rrb-
as
neither
sweet
nor
vulnerable
and
she
be
quite
resistible
.
alessa
be
a
young
woman
who
happen
to
be
a
brilliant
art
dealer
in
the
toronto
art
scene
.
this
be
some
sort
of
alternate
world
art
scene
where
people
pay
ten
of
thousand
of
dollar
for
painting
by
talented
beginner
and
dealer
in
these
painting
fly
back
and
forth
to
place
like
switzerland
.
one
of
the
most
knowledgeable
of
the
art
dealer
be
alessa
.
she
also
happen
to
be
the
center
of
adulation
of
she
friend
and
every
party
have
suitor
camp
outside
she
window
.
next
door
to
alessa
move
struggle
genius
artist
and
native
american
ben
crowchild
-lrb-
adam
beach
-rrb-
.
he
see
that
behind
the
facade
that
there
be
really
a
sad
little
girl
within
alessa
who
really
will
not
be
happy
with
the
rich
art
collector
she
be
date
.
ben
get
emotionally
involve
with
alessa
.
-lrb-
as
alessa
so
delicately
put
it
,
''
we
be
bosom
buddy
,
now
we
be
fuck
buddy
.
''
-rrb-
but
alessa
will
have
to
decide
whether
she
want
love
with
ben
or
wealth
with
she
rich
suitor
.
the
real
problem
with
the
film
seem
to
be
helen
lee
's
inability
to
decide
what
she
want
to
be
say
.
she
undercut
nearly
everything
she
want
we
to
believe
about
alessa
.
alessa
be
look
for
financial
security
but
she
make
decision
about
large
sum
of
money
for
she
client
.
this
appear
to
be
a
high
profile
and
well-paid
job
.
we
be
suppose
to
care
about
alessa
's
feeling
,
but
she
coldly
refuse
to
visit
she
own
ail
father
.
alessa
can
not
be
portray
as
sweet
and
vulnerable
if
at
a
art
auction
she
turn
into
we
man
flint
.
this
be
a
charmless
romantic
comedy
that
bet
everything
it
have
on
the
appeal
of
its
main
character
and
come
up
double-zero
.
i
rate
it
a
3
on
the
0
to
10
scale
and
a
-1
on
the
-4
to
+4
scale
.
