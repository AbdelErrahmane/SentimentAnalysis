a
few
month
before
the
release
of
star
war
episode
1
,
the
phantom
menace
,
20th
century
fox
decide
to
release
another
space
film
,
that
be
a
complete
rip
off
of
star
war
.
what
be
the
point
of
this
?
i
do
not
know
,
but
i
wish
it
have
not
be
do
,
consider
wing
commander
be
definitely
the
year
's
worst
film
so
far
.
to
attract
people
to
this
horrible
movie
,
they
attach
the
full
trailer
for
the
phantom
menace
.
wing
commander
will
draw
large
crowd
,
because
this
be
the
only
film
where
you
can
find
the
phantom
menace
full
trailer
attach
at
this
time
.
the
trailer
for
the
phantom
menace
be
certainly
the
best
part
of
the
movie
experience
i
have
tonight
.
many
people
do
not
know
that
wing
commander
be
base
on
a
star
war
computer
game
.
i
find
this
very
interesting
,
consider
this
fact
almost
say
that
wing
commander
be
a
star
war
movie
.
it
be
nowhere
near
the
level
of
the
star
war
film
though
.
freddie
prinze
jr
.
star
in
the
film
as
christopher
blair
.
wing
commander
be
a
huge
mistake
for
freddie
.
this
be
definitely
he
worst
performance
to
date
.
after
January
's
she
be
all
that
,
i
actually
see
a
good
actor
in
freddie
,
but
now
all
those
vision
have
be
crush
.
-lrb-
for
now
anyway
.
-rrb-
christopher
blair
be
a
pilot
who
be
a
part
of
the
battle
to
stop
the
kilrathus
,
a
group
that
be
try
to
destroy
the
earth
.
blair
's
parent
also
fight
in
the
space
battle
,
and
also
die
there
.
he
parent
be
pilgrim
,
so
many
people
disrespect
he
because
of
this
.
blair
be
under
the
command
of
''
angel
''
,
play
by
saffron
burrow
,
and
he
be
friend
with
another
pilot
,
todd
''
maniac
marshall
''
,
play
by
matthew
lillard
.
matthew
lillard
seem
to
play
the
same
role
in
every
movie
,
and
he
do
in
this
one
too
.
he
character
as
stu
in
1996
's
scream
-lrb-
a
+
-rrb-
,
be
a
great
one
,
but
now
,
it
seem
like
that
same
role
be
be
play
again
,
only
in
a
space
movie
.
the
three
be
just
a
small
part
of
a
large
group
try
to
stop
the
kilrathus
before
they
take
over
earth
.
this
plot
be
very
flimsy
,
and
do
not
give
a
whole
lot
to
work
with
at
all
.
this
explain
why
wing
commander
drag
on
,
seem
like
there
be
no
point
to
any
of
the
event
that
be
go
on
.
the
acting
be
horrible
in
wing
commander
.
many
line
seem
out
of
place
,
and
be
completely
meaningless
.
the
act
and
dialogue
be
so
terrible
,
i
even
find
myself
laugh
at
it
.
the
other
thing
which
be
very
bad
about
wing
commander
be
the
special
effect
and
the
music
.
the
special
effect
be
very
unrealistic
.
when
look
at
two
ship
fly
side
by
side
,
it
be
simple
to
tell
they
be
hang
and
a
blue
screen
be
behind
they
.
the
explosion
look
very
unrealistic
as
well
.
a
ship
will
be
blow
up
,
but
there
will
only
be
fire
present
four
about
one
half
of
a
second
.
this
be
very
unrealistic
.
music
pretty
much
accompany
the
film
the
entire
time
.
the
music
also
feel
like
video
game
music
,
and
it
be
very
corny
and
annoying
sound
.
after
we
be
give
the
plot
,
the
film
repeat
itself
for
another
hour
,
without
any
plot
twist
,
interesting
scene
,
or
anything
important
to
the
film
.
blair
be
force
to
make
jump
over
other
planet
,
and
he
must
also
fight
against
the
kilrathus
aircraft
.
for
the
entire
length
of
the
movie
,
it
take
place
in
space
.
it
be
truly
like
you
be
in
a
video
game
,
because
you
be
just
watch
people
shoot
at
each
other
in
ship
for
a
long
,
extended
period
of
time
.
it
be
not
much
fun
to
watch
at
all
.
if
i
want
to
watch
people
shoot
at
each
other
in
ship
,
i
would
go
watch
star
war
at
home
.
at
least
star
war
pay
attention
to
people
,
myth
,
feeling
,
and
have
some
real
plot
to
it
.
