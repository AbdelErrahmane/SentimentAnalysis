godzillum
be
the
ultimate
culmination
of
the
''
who
care
about
plot
''
summer
movie
.
a
loose
remake
of
the
1954
''
classic
''
japanese
monster
movie
,
godzillum
,
king
of
the
monster
-lrb-
which
be
itself
pretty
thin
in
the
story
department
-rrb-
,
roland
emmerich
and
dean
devlin
's
big-budget
lizard-stomps-manhattan
disaster
flick
have
be
write
with
the
brain
dead
in
mind
.
the
script
be
not
just
''
dumb
down
,
''
it
be
lobotomize
.
godzillum
life
and
die
on
special
effect
alone
.
presumably
,
the
primary
target
group
for
this
film
be
teenage
boy
,
the
demographic
most
likely
to
shell
out
$
7
repeatedly
to
see
the
same
image
of
monster-instigated
carnage
.
that
be
not
to
say
that
female
and
other
age
group
be
immune
to
the
special
effect
seduction
;
they
be
just
not
as
readily
susceptible
.
this
be
the
third
straight
movie
in
a
row
where
emmerich
and
devlin
have
demonstrate
that
a
mastery
of
computer-generated
visual
be
far
more
important
for
make
money
than
the
ability
to
write
and
direct
for
actor
.
stargate
be
a
financial
success
.
independence
day
be
a
runaway
hit
.
and
,
with
godzillum
already
drown
in
hype
and
merchandising
tie-in
before
it
even
open
,
it
be
virtually
guarantee
at
least
$
100
million
.
nice
number
for
a
film
that
could
have
be
pen
by
a
not-too-precocious
grade
school
kid
.
godzillum
be
not
completely
without
merit
,
although
it
be
close
.
there
be
a
certain
visceral
thrill
inherent
in
watch
the
giant
lizard
rip
he
way
through
manhattan
,
but
it
wear
off
quickly
.
frankly
,
while
the
special
effect
be
competent
,
they
be
not
all
that
stunning
.
there
be
nothing
new
here
;
it
be
jurassic
park
meet
alien
,
with
a
little
independence
day
throw
in
for
bad
measure
.
maybe
it
will
require
george
luca
and
he
new
star
war
movie
to
take
computer-generated
visual
to
the
next
level
.
godzillum
never
really
push
the
envelope
,
prefer
to
remain
within
a
comfort
zone
.
the
imagination
of
monster
movie
like
king
kong
have
be
replace
by
a
crass
,
formulaic
approach
which
disallow
creativity
.
-lrb-
how
disturbing
be
it
to
know
that
godzillum
have
be
choose
to
close
the
51st
canne
film
festival
?
-rrb-
worst
of
all
,
godzillum
be
not
even
exciting
.
with
the
possible
exception
of
a
mildly
enjoyable
car
chase
near
the
end
,
there
be
not
a
sequence
in
this
film
that
raise
the
pulse
.
even
the
scene
with
dozen
of
aircraft
attack
the
monster
be
so
devoid
of
tension
and
suspense
that
they
be
yawn-provoking
.
independence
day
may
have
be
dumb
,
but
it
be
full
of
''
adrenaline
moment
''
capable
of
get
the
audience
involve
in
the
action
.
in
this
aspect
of
its
production
,
as
in
so
many
other
,
godzillum
be
lack
.
actually
,
part
of
the
problem
be
that
we
be
never
sure
who
we
be
suppose
to
be
root
for
:
the
green
monster
with
a
attitude
or
the
paper-thin
human
try
to
stop
he
.
the
plot
,
such
as
it
be
,
can
be
sum
up
rather
simply
.
after
sink
a
few
ship
and
leave
some
footprint
on
tropical
island
,
godzillum
show
up
in
the
big
apple
.
he
do
some
of
the
usual
tourist
thing
:
stop
by
madison
square
garden
,
visit
the
chrysler
building
,
go
on
a
walk
through
central
park
,
and
take
the
subway
.
in
the
process
,
he
knock
over
a
few
building
and
step
on
countless
cab
,
but
he
never
have
trouble
with
traffic
jam
.
on
hand
to
stop
he
be
a
elite
u
.
s
.
army
unit
,
lead
by
a
slightly
less-arrogant-than-usual
military
man
-lrb-
kevin
dunn
-rrb-
and
a
biologist
name
nick
tatopoulo
,
who
have
a
theory
about
godzillum
.
in
he
opinion
,
the
big
guy
be
actually
a
lizard
grow
to
enormous
proportion
as
a
result
of
the
radiation
give
off
by
french
atomic
bomb
test
in
the
south
pacific
.
in
nick
's
word
,
godzillum
be
''
a
mutate
aberration
?
a
incipient
creature
?
the
first
of
its
kind
.
''
as
luck
would
have
it
,
nick
's
old
girlfriend
,
audrey
-lrb-
marium
pitillo
-rrb-
,
be
a
reporter
base
at
a
new
york
tv
station
.
along
with
she
cameraman
friend
,
animal
-lrb-
hank
azarium
-rrb-
,
she
decide
to
follow
nick
around
as
he
trail
godzillum
.
then
,
just
when
the
military
have
reject
nick
's
theory
about
why
godzillum
be
in
new
york
,
a
member
of
the
french
secret
service
-lrb-
jean
reno
-rrb-
recruit
he
for
a
special
assignment
.
instead
of
stomp
around
tokyo
this
time
,
godzillum
have
choose
new
york
city
.
unfortunately
,
manhattan
have
be
destroy
so
many
time
in
recent
disaster
movie
-lrb-
independence
day
,
deep
impact
,
armageddon
-rrb-
that
it
be
become
boring
.
the
whole
tradition
of
monster
roam
around
the
city
start
with
king
kong
,
but
the
big
ape
be
only
about
30
foot
tall
.
he
could
climb
the
empire
state
building
.
at
ten
time
that
height
,
godzillum
would
be
more
likely
to
knock
it
over
.
godzillum
contain
a
few
lame
attempt
at
humor
.
there
be
a
ongoing
feud
between
animal
and
he
wife
that
play
like
sit-com
material
,
a
unfunny
and
repetitive
gag
about
how
no
one
can
pronounce
nick
's
last
name
properly
,
and
a
rather
tame
attack
on
film
critic
roger
ebert
and
gene
siskel
.
both
of
the
popular
personality
have
alter
ego
in
the
film
:
''
ebert
,
''
the
mayor
of
new
york
,
be
play
by
michael
lerner
,
and
''
gene
''
-lrb-
lorry
goldman
-rrb-
be
he
campaign
manager
.
ebert
's
re-election
slogan
be
,
not
surprisingly
,
''
thumb
up
for
new
york
.
''
the
siskel\/ebert
stuff
be
amusing
the
first
time
it
be
use
,
but
,
after
a
while
,
it
grow
tiresome
.
and
,
although
the
''
character
''
do
not
serve
any
real
purpose
,
they
keep
pop
up
.
godzillum
be
saddle
with
a
unimpressive
cast
.
this
be
largely
because
emmerich
do
not
want
to
risk
a
human
performance
upstage
he
lizard
.
that
be
not
to
say
that
matthew
broderick
and
jean
reno
be
not
capable
of
good
performance
-lrb-
both
have
do
they
share
of
solid
act
in
the
past
-rrb-
,
but
they
be
not
a-list
name
.
then
again
,
consider
the
quality
of
the
writing
,
even
pacino
and
deniro
would
have
be
hard
-
press
to
shine
.
marium
pitillo
-lrb-
dear
god
-rrb-
play
the
love
interest
and
hank
azarium
-lrb-
great
expectation
-rrb-
be
on
hand
to
present
what
be
suppose
to
be
comic
relief
.
ultimately
,
it
do
not
really
matter
what
i
-lrb-
or
any
other
critic
,
for
that
matter
-rrb-
have
to
say
about
the
movie
.
tristar
have
assume
that
godzillum
,
like
all
self-proclaimed
summer
event
motion
picture
,
be
pretty
much
critic-proof
.
it
may
also
be
word-of-mouth-proof
.
those
who
want
to
see
the
movie
will
see
it
no
matter
what
i
write
or
they
friend
say
.
so
,
when
i
go
on
record
to
assert
that
godzillum
be
one
of
the
most
idiotic
blockbuster
movie
of
all
time
,
it
be
like
spit
into
the
wind
.
emmerich
and
devlin
be
master
illusionist
,
wave
they
wand
and
mesmerizing
audience
with
they
smoke
and
mirror
.
it
be
probably
too
much
to
hope
that
some
day
,
movie-goer
will
wake
up
and
realize
that
they
have
be
have
.
