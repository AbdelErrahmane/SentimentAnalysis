i
think
that
say
that
the
x-files
be
one
of
this
summer
's
most
anticipate
film
be
safe
.
for
five
year
,
''
the
x-files
''
television
show
have
develop
a
dedicated
fan
culture
,
whose
rabid
devotion
to
the
series
rival
that
of
''
star
trek
''
fan
.
the
premise
of
both
the
movie
and
the
television
series
be
two
fbus
agent
who
investigate
the
paranormal
;
fox
mulder
-lrb-
david
duchovny
-rrb-
be
the
avid
believer
whose
quest
to
find
the
truth
about
extraterrestrial
life
border
on
the
paranoid
,
and
dana
scully
-lrb-
gillian
anderson
-rrb-
be
the
scientific
skeptic
try
to
find
a
rational
explanation
to
mulder
's
flight
of
fancy
.
outline
the
plot
of
the
x-files
movie
be
virtually
impossible
,
since
to
be
general
would
result
in
confusion
,
yet
to
be
specific
would
give
too
much
away
.
nevertheless
,
i
will
try
.
''
the
black
ooze
,
''
and
extraterrestrial
,
virus-like
substance
be
threaten
earth
.
a
''
shadow
government
''
be
aware
of
this
,
but
try
to
cover-up
the
alien
existence
.
mulder
and
scully
know
''
the
truth
be
out
there
,
''
and
so
try
to
expose
both
the
invasion
and
the
cover-up
.
there
be
three
central
question
i
have
hear
ask
about
this
movie
:
1
.
will
those
who
do
not
watch
the
series
be
able
to
understand
the
movie
?
yes
.
isolate
as
a
individual
text
,
the
x-files
can
stand
alone
.
they
have
give
enough
background
for
anyone
,
familiar
with
the
show
or
not
,
to
understand
the
movie
.
although
some
of
the
secondary
character
'
history
may
confuse
the
uninitiated
,
those
character
be
not
essential
to
the
film
.
this
be
a
major
problem
:
they
trot
out
token
secondary
character
from
the
series
out
for
a
appearance
and
then
disappear
just
as
quickly
.
why
bring
superintendent
skinner
into
the
picture
in
the
first
place
,
and
then
have
he
sit
silently
on
a
fbus
internal
affair
committee
?
why
bring
in
''
the
lone
gunman
,
''
three
computer
geek
conspiracy
theorist
,
for
a
even
briefer
appearance
?
these
character
be
recurrent
on
the
series
,
and
they
appearance
in
the
film
be
meet
with
whoop
from
the
audience
-lrb-
suggest
they
popularity
among
fan
-
actually
most
of
the
audience
could
pass
for
''
the
lone
gunman
''
-rrb-
.
still
,
then
they
vanish
just
as
quickly
.
2
.
the
television
show
never
give
we
any
answer
.
will
the
movie
actually
explain
some
thing
?
yes
.
in
the
x-files
we
get
a
fairly
complete
history
of
''
the
black
ooze
,
''
what
it
be
and
what
it
want
.
we
finally
get
some
understanding
of
the
motivation
behind
the
''
shadow
government
.
''
there
be
even
some
subtle
tie-in
with
contemporary
ufo-ology
,
include
the
''
grey
''
and
the
roswell
crash
of
1947
.
3
.
be
the
movie
any
good
?
no
.
the
x-files
be
a
dreadful
movie
and
show
some
fundamental
problem
with
writer\/creator
chri
carter
's
talent
and
the
relationship
between
cinema
and
television
.
first
off
,
the
screenplay
by
series
creator
chri
carter
be
sloppy
and
cliched
.
after
approximately
forty-five
minute
-lrb-
the
length
of
a
television
episode
minus
the
commercial
-rrb-
,
the
pace
drop
to
a
snail
's
crawl
.
not
long
after
that
point
,
when
carter
attempt
to
answer
some
question
we
have
have
about
the
series
,
we
wish
he
have
not
.
the
explanation
be
so
trite
and
ridiculous
that
one
would
have
prefer
it
have
carter
not
explain
quite
so
much
.
i
be
willing
to
suspend
my
disbelief
a
fair
bit
,
but
the
absurdity
carter
want
I
to
swallow
be
just
too
much
.
break
the
suspension
of
disbelief
destroy
the
movie
-
and
listen
to
other
fan
leave
the
cinema
,
maybe
the
series
too
.
the
explanation
be
not
only
absurd
,
they
be
tired
and
unoriginal
.
the
extraterrestrial
breed
and
gestate
like
those
from
the
alien
series
,
and
they
craft
look
like
a
leftover
set
piece
from
independence
day
.
note
that
the
alien
movie
,
id4
,
and
the
x-files
be
all
from
20thcentury
fox
-
a
studio
that
be
begin
to
cannibalize
itself
i
think
.
the
x-files
be
noteworthy
for
be
the
only
movie
base
on
a
television
series
to
be
produce
while
the
series
be
still
run
.
in
compare
the
movie
and
television
series
certain
aspect
of
the
respective
media
emerge
.
the
avoidance
of
the
series
to
answer
the
question
it
raise
annoyed
and
frustrated
many
people
.
however
,
i
rather
like
that
about
the
series
.
television
allow
you
to
impose
as
much
,
or
as
little
,
mean
on
a
show
as
you
want
.
it
be
the
proverbial
''
blank

''
which
we
project

mind
on

mean
on

be
open
and

;
it
be
the
nature

,
on
the
other

the
opposite

it

we
can
,
in

film
,
fill
the

ourselves
,
but
that
almost
never
happen
in
a
american
film
.
meaning
,
in
cinema
,
need
to
be
self-contained
and
determine
.
so
,
when
the
x-files
make
that
jump
from
small
to
big
screen
,
carter
need
to
take
into
consideration
the
difference
in
the
medium
as
well
.
he
do
not
.
by
make
explicit
,
what
the

carter
reveal
the
limit
of

skill
.
when
they
say
that
''
fan
''
make
a

show
,
it
be
not
far
from
the
truth
.
on

,
fan
culture
must
impose
its
meaning
on
the

because
there
be
nothing
there

how
true
that
be
