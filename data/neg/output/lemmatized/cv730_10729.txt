how
do
you
judge
a
film
that
be
so
bad
,
but
intentionally
so
?
in
spiceworld
,
the
highly
popular
singing
group
the
spice
girl
accomplish
they
major
goal
:
mock
themselves
with
a
purposely
cheezy
film
and
have
a
lot
of
fun
do
it
.
if
that
be
they
goal
,
they
do
a
fantastic
job
.
so
be
it
fair
to
give
it
such
a
low
grade
when
it
be
not
really
mean
to
be
much
better
than
this
?
honestly
,
i
would
rather
see
this
film
before
many
other
i
give
higher
grade
,
so
do
that
mean
i
grade
it
inaccurately
?
truth
be
know
,
i
do
not
really
think
i
can
answer
this
question
.
to
understand
spiceworld
,
you
have
to
understand
the
spice
girl
.
unless
you
be
very
\*
very
\*
young
,
or
fairly
older
,
you
probably
have
at
least
hear
of
they
.
they
be
a
group
of
five
busty
british
babe
who
have
have
#
1
hit
singles
and
whose
debut
album
sell
million
.
they
be
primarily
adore
by
pre-teen
girl
who
hope
someday
the
contents
of
they
training
bra
might
match
those
of
ginger
spice
's
-lrb-
real
name
:
gerus
haliwell
-rrb-
wonderbra
.
all
five
of
the
girl
have
these
''
spicy
''
name
for
which
they
be
better
know
than
they
real
name
.
there
be
the
aforementioned
ginger
spice
,
as
well
as
sporty
spice
-lrb-
melanie
chisholm
,
or
mel
c
.
-rrb-
,
scary
spice
-lrb-
melanie
brown
,
or
mel
b
.
-rrb-
,
baby
spice
-lrb-
emma
bunton
-rrb-
,
and
posh
spice
-lrb-
victorium
addam
-rrb-
,
and
all
of
they
,
to
some
degree
or
another
,
resemble
they
stage
name
.
the
spice
girl
take
the
world
by
storm
,
and
spiceworld
be
actually
a
good
-
humor
spoof
of
all
that
transpire
during
they
quick
rise
to
fame
.
it
be
quite
nice
to
see
what
good
sport
the
girl
be
-lrb-
and
not
just
the
one
dub
sporty
-rrb-
about
poke
fun
at
themselves
.
they
do
not
take
themselves
too
seriously
,
and
that
be
probably
the
best
thing
about
they
.
it
be
also
surprising
how
natural
they
seem
in
front
of
the
camera
\*
act
\*
,
and
not
just
singing
and
dancing
.
they
be
not
flawless
by
any
means
,
but
for
the
most
part
,
they
deliver
they
line
without
feeling
stage
,
and
,
like
they
or
not
,
we
get
the
sense
the
five
be
very
at
home
within
they
character
-lrb-
which
seem
reasonable
since
they
portray
themselves
-rrb-
.
what
make
the
film
bad
be
that
extreme
fan
of
the
spice
girl
will
not
get
enough
of
they
music
,
while
the
rest
of
we
do
not
get
enough
of
a
movie
.
the
real
point
of
this
be
to
look
at
the
spice
girl
for
over
ninety
straight
minute
.
most
of
the
film
be
very
blas
?
,
but
several
part
be
downright
boring
,
and
then
they
have
those
sporadic
moment
that
actually
make
we
laugh
out
loud
!
if
you
be
a
big
fan
of
the
group
,
you
probably
will
not
get
enough
of
what
you
want
,
and
if
you
be
not
a
big
fan
,
you
get
too
much
time
devoted
to
nothing
more
than
''
look
at
we
''
moment
.
for
the
right
crowd
,
the
''
music
video
''
sequence
will
be
the
highlight
of
the
film
,
but
for
other
,
they
will
serve
as
three-minute
lull
in
a
hectic-but-overall-uneventful
storyline
.
other
key
actor
include
richard
e
.
grant
as
clifford
,
the
spice
girl
'
manager
,
alan
cumming
as
the
film-maker
pier
cutherton-smyth
who
attempt
to
make
a
documentary
of
the
group
,
george
wendt
as
martin
barnfield
,
a
producer
who
constantly
work
on
pitch
a
spice
girl
movie
,
and
roger
moore
in
a
small
,
self-parodizing
role
.
all
provide
relatively
good
performance
,
keep
in
mind
once
again
that
this
film
be
not
mean
to
be
act
seriously
.
even
meat
loaf
show
up
as
denni
the
bus
driver
and
seem
to
have
fun
with
it
.
while
this
film
be
continuously
compare
to
the
beatle
'
a
hard
day
's
night
,
i
think
that
be
a
unjust
comparison
.
it
be
supposedly
the
movie
studio
that
first
mad
the
comparison
by
way
of
press
kit
,
but
i
do
not
think
drector
bob
spier
,
nor
the
spice
girl
,
intend
it
to
be
so
.
i
think
the
studio
be
just
try
to
boost
hype
and
interest
in
the
film
,
and
have
instead
,
come
off
rather
pretentious
.
i
do
not
think
this
film
be
try
to
be
anything
more
than
a
fun
,
satirical
look
at
a
group
that
get
so
big
,
a
movie
seem
the
next
likely
step
.
and
what
could
have
be
better
than
a
self-indulged
yet
self
-
mock
approach
?
probably
nothing
,
and
so
it
be
.
spiceworld
be
a
movie
i
think
would
be
embarrassing
to
enjoy
,
but
now
instead
,
i
find
myself
want
to
defend
a
movie
i
do
not
even
give
a
good
review
.
it
be
bad
,
but
it
succeed
in
every
way
it
intend
.
it
give
the
spice
girl
a
chance
to
play
while
allow
all
those
obsessive
fan
out
there
to
indulge
in
every
brainless
moment
.
perhaps
the
group
be
nothing
more
than
a
gimmick
.
if
that
be
the
case
,
the
movie
's
gimmick
be
that
it
\*
be
\*
such
a
gimmick
!
you
might
be
say
,
''
a
spice
girl
movie
?
come
on
!
''
,
but
when
it
come
down
to
it
,
i
think
that
be
the
point
.
