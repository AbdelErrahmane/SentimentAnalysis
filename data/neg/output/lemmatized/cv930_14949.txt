_
soldier
_
be
hand
down
one
of
the
worst
movie
a
person
could
ever
have
to
sit
through
that
do
not
have
jean
claude
van
damme
in
it
.
i
could
liken
it
to
the
sci-fi
cheese
that
be
the
hollywood
product-of-choice
back
in
the
early
80s
,
but
that
would
be
too
much
of
a
compliment
.
if
there
be
a
movie
theater
in
hell
,
this
film
be
play
there
24
hour
a
day
.
the
story
,
such
that
there
be
,
revolve
around
todd
-lrb-
kurt
russell
-rrb-
,
a
automaton
of
a
man
who
have
be
raise
from
birth
to
be
a
merciless
soldier
in
a
not-too-distant
ultra-conservative
future
-lrb-
be
there
any
other
kind
?
-rrb-
after
year
of
desensitization
at
a
military
academy
full
of
other
boy
just
like
he
,
todd
become
a
ground
fighter
in
a
series
of
war
all
over
the
galaxy
.
who
the
enemy
in
these
war
be
be
never
reveal
,
but
the
few
glimpse
of
todd
in
battle
show
that
it
do
not
matter
,
because
innocent
hostage
be
wipe
out
as
indifferently
as
the
bad
guy
.
after
ten
minute
of
this
nihilistic
trash
--
yes
folk
,
there
be
more
--
we
see
todd
as
a
buff
,
scar
adult
,
now
so
accustomed
to
the
carnage
that
no
confrontation
at
all
cause
he
to
break
a
sweat
.
there
be
a
new
wrinkle
,
though
.
todd
and
he
brethren
be
declare
obsolete
,
and
a
new
batch
of
soldier
take
they
place
.
after
lose
a
sanction
battle
with
_
dragon
_
's
jason
scott
lee
,
the
seemingly
dead
todd
be
dump
by
a
fly
ice-cube
tray
-lrb-
well
,
that
be
what
be
look
like
-rrb-
on
a
remote
garbage
planet
.
if
you
predict
that
todd
meet
a
bunch
of
outcast
settler
on
this
planet
,
and
that
they
band
together
to
fight
a
bunch
of
bad
guy
come
to
destroy
they
,
you
be
way
ahead
of
the
game
.
the
renegade
society
on
this
trash
heap
be
so
clich
you
half-expect
tina
turner
and
master
blaster
to
come
stroll
into
frame
any
minute
.
it
be
surprising
that
_
soldier
_
be
the
brain-child
of
_
blade
runner
_
co-writer
david
webb
people
.
unlike
that
mind-twisting
classic
,
this
film
contain
just
barely
enough
dialogue
to
fill
about
three
double-spaced
page
.
add
into
the
mix
the
_
mortal
kombat
_
's
paul
anderson
inept
direction
,
and
it
be
easy
to
see
how
_
soldier
_
turn
out
so
bad
.
and
the
special
effect
!
remember
the
fly
steam
iron
in
hardware
war
?
gary
busey
be
in
this
movie
.
`
nuff
say
.
_
soldier
_
be
proof
that
hollywood
still
have
plenty
of
bad
idea
sit
in
its
script
vault
.
that
this
sad
film
make
it
to
the
silver
screen
should
encourage
plenty
of
aspire
screenwriter
out
there
that
there
be
hope
after
all
.
now
if
you
'll
excuse
I
,
i
have
to
go
weep
for
the
future
.
