serious
1994
drama

but
he
luck
have
ultimately
run
out
with
he
latest
picture
,
''
message
in

,
''
which
be
the
worst
type
of
romance
,
a
movie
that
tug
so
relentlessly
and
violently
at
the
heartstrings
that
it
miraculously
manage
to
dry
out
you
eye
rather
than
tear
they
up
.
everything
that
occur
can
be
telegraph
way
in
advance
since
this
same
type
of
story
have
be
do
many
time
before
--
and
much
better
--
so
there
be
a
absence
of
suspense
,
and
the
film
ultimately
move
at
such
a
very
,
very
deliberate
pace
,
as
if
it
be
try
to
make
great
,
''
meaningful
''
statement
and
plot
development
,
that
it
just
become
a
tedious
bear

''
message

begin
with
theresa
osborne
-lrb-
robin
wright
penn
-rrb-
,
a
single
mother
and
researcher
at
the
chicago
tribune
,
whom
find
a
bottle
wash
up
on
shore
as
she
be
jogging
one
day
.
inside
the
bottle
be
a
anonymous
love
letter
address
to
a
mystery
woman
name
catherine
,
and
theresa
be
so
take
aback
by
its
honesty
and
sweetness
that
she
show
it
around
at
she
work
and
,
to
she
objection
,
find
that
she
editor
have
place
the
letter
in
the
newspaper
.
soon
,
a
heavy
research
be
conduct
to
find
out
who
write
the
letter
base
on
the
type
of
bottle
and
a
ship
logo
on
the
top
of
the
type
message
,
and
after
it
be
trace
to
a
man
name
garrett
blake
,
theresa
find
herself
travel
to
the
outer
bank
,
a
boat
town
in
north
carolina
,
to
find
out
the
specifics
of
the
message
.
of
course
,
garrett
turn
out
to
be
a
handsome
,
rugged
man
around
theresa
's
age
and
play
by
kevin
costner
.
she
be
immediately
charm
by
he
,
but
hesitant
to
unveil
the
truth
of
why
she
be
there
,
and
find
that
catherine
be
garrett
's
late
wife
who
die
a
few
year
earlier

do
you
think
you
know
where
this
be
head
?
most
likely
you
do
,
and
i
would
not
call
it
give
away
anything
to
say
that
by
the
picture
's
end
,
the
movie
have
fall
into
deep
,
artificial
melodrama
that
i
do
not
buy
for
a
second
.
if
there
be
any
positive
thing
to
say
about
''
message
in
a
bottle
,
''
it
be
that
the
performance
by
robin
wright
penn
and
paul
newman
,
as
garrett
's
stubborn
,
but
loving
father
,
be
far
above
par
to
be
in
such
a
wasteful
,
''
shaggy
dog
''
love
story
,
and
that
the
cinematography
by
caleb
deschanel
take
great
advantage
of
the
beautiful
eastern
coast
,
and
paint
chicago
as
a
equally
alluring
city
.
meanwhile
,
costner
have
yet
to
redeem
himself
for
some
of
the
less-than-stellar
film
that
he
have
make
recently
.
it
seem
that
with
such
bad
luck
,
he
would
not
want
to
make
another
movie
set
near
water
,
but
here
he
be
again
with
one
of
the
main
,
and
most
ridiculous
,
centerpiece
set
on
a
storm-swept
sea
.
the
other
actor
be
all
,
sadly
,
waste
,
include
illeana
dougla
,
a
underused
actress
who
seem
to
always
get
stick
with
the
''
friend
''
role
,
here
play
penn
's
confidante
and
co-worker
at
the
tribune
.
the
first
half
of
''
message
in
a
bottle
''
play
like
a
hum-drum
,
trite
television
movie
for
the
lifetime
channel
,
as
theresa
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
''
get
to
know
''
garrett
,
with
dialogue
that
be
not
the
least
bit
stimulating
or
entertaining
.
usually
,
i
be
the
type
of
person
to
practically
salivate
over
dialogue-laden
sequence
since
the
film
be
no
doubt
try
to
develop
the
character
and
they
relationship
,
but
here
it
all
ring
with
a
resounding
falseness
since
the
dialogue
feel
''
write
,
''
and
not
as
if
people
be
really
''
talk
.
''
when
the
main
character
of
a
film
have
very
little
of
interest
to
say
to
each
other
,
and
be
not
particularly
interesting
themselves
,
you
know
immediately
that
you
be
in
trouble
.
i
swear
that
while
watch
''
message
in
a
bottle
,
''
i
feel
as
if
i
have
just
read
the
screenplay
in
its
entirety
before
arrive
at
the
theater
-lrb-
heck
,
in
actuality
i
be
not
even
familiar
to
the
novel
this
be
base
on
,
by
nichola
spark
-rrb-
.
always
one
step
ahead
of
the
character
,
the
movie
run
so
closely
and
tightly
to
the
constraint
of
the
tried-and-true
hollywood
melodrama
,
the
film
strip
often
seem
to
almost
be
in
danger
of
tear
.
nobody
win
prize
for
guess
that
garrett
will
eventually
find
out
theresa
's
secret
,
and
that
several
obstacle
will
come
within
they
way
of
live
happily
ever
after
.
this
same
exact
problem
occur
in
last
year
's
very
,
very
similar
-lrb-
watch
this
,
and
you
will
realize
just
how
similar
i
mean

''
although
theresa
be
deeply
touch
by
the
''
heartfelt
''
letter
that
she
find
in
the
bottle
,
perhaps
the
filmaker
might
have
be
better
off
find
a
message
in
a

of
they
own
,
preferably
before
film
begin

it
should
have
read
