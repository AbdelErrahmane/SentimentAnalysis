recently
one
night
a
young
director
name
baz
luhrmann
could
not
sleep
.
he
tumble
out
of
bed
and
move
over
to
the
television
where
he
watch
mtv
for
a
hour
.
then
he
move
to
he
kitchen
where
he
spend
the
same
amount
of
time
eat
spoil
food
.
then
he
take
down
a
volume
of
shakespeare
's
work
and
read
it
cover
to
cover
-
never
really
pay
attention
to
the
word
or
plot
.
and
then
,
as
a
climax
,
he
take
out
he
video
camera
and
press
the
''
on
''
button
.
the
result
?
william
shakespeare
's
romeo
+
juliet
-
the
worst
film
ever
make
and
a
complete
failure
.
though
,
to
be
fair
,
a
interesting
complete
failure
.
the
idea
at
the
film
's
core
be
to
make
shakespeare
appeal
to
the
crowd
.
this
be
do
by
move
the
camera
around
at
a
rapid
rate
so
that
we
can
not
see
what
be
go
on
.
and
film
the
dialogue
in
voice
over
.
and
shooting
leonardo
dicaprio
like
a
calvin
klein
model
.
and
make
the
frame
go
still
while
flash
the
character
's
name
at
the
bottom
.
and
film
long
tedious
action
sequence
in
slow
motion
.
i
mean
,
man
,
this
be
the
90
,
dude
.
however
i
have
see
terrible
film
that
be
fun
to
watch
.
-lrb-
example
be
batman
and
robin
and
the
island
of
doctor
moreau
.
-rrb-
that
rule
do
not
apply
here
.
this
be
a
film
that
take
itself
seriously
.
that
be
it
be
major
fault
.
another
problem
be
point
out
by
my
friend
,
alex
-lrb-
who
be
singing
song
by
leonard
bernstein
throughout
.
-rrb-
;
the
original
play
be
a
powerful
piece
of
work
because
the
author
remain
neutral
and
do
not
take
side
.
here
it
be
clear
that
we
be
suppose
to
side
with
romeo
.
-lrb-
just
look
at
the
way
they
film
he
.
-rrb-
from
the
begining
he
be
we
hero
and
this
do
not
work
.
and
dicaprio
's
awful
performance
do
not
help
.
luhrmann
never
decide
if
he
want
to
entertain
we
or
enlighten
we
.
the
result
be
a
mess
.
you
can
feel
he
strive
to
be
something
he
be
not
.
he
try
to
pull
of
a
mix
in
which
drag
queen
be
film
from
purposefully
arty
angle
.
he
try
very
hard
.
key
word
:
try
.
''
oh
look
,
he
be
film
above
water
action
from
below
.
pretty
.
what
do
it
represent
?
''
why
do
people
do
ugly
thing
?
i
scramble
away
from
my
tv
set
feeling
guilty
as
if
i
could
never
read
the
play
again
and
keep
a
straight
face
.
