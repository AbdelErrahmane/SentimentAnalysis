accord
to
the
publicity
material
,
with
this
movie
the
director
''
hope
to
restore
good
old-fashioned
bowling
to
its
rightful
place
in
the
mainstream
of
american
consciousness
.
''
hmm
.
you
never
know
,
they
just
might
be
on
to
something
.
what
with
the
rise
of
geek
chic
,
lounge
music
and
seventy
fashion
,
the
ever-contrary
kid
of
the
ninety
might
just
latch
on
to
bowling
as
another
terminally
unhip
bastion
of
tackyana
to
claim
as
they
own
.
but
then
,
i
doubt
if
kingpin
will
have
anything
to
do
with
it
.
it
be
cheesy
all
right
,
but
connoisseur
of
bad
taste
will
find
this
film
exude
that
bland
smell
of
stale
joke
rather
than
the
invigorating
stink
of
true
kitsch
.
that
be
a
shame
,
because
,
in
the
first
ten
minute
or
so
the
film
promise
to
be
a
lot
more
.
woody
harrelson
play
the
hotshot
bowler
on
the
rise
,
roy
munson
.
the
movie
open
in
the
fifty
with
roy
's
dad
dish
out
the
reader
's
digest\/gumpian
wisdom
in
scoopful
,
shift
to
the
70
for
a
hilarious
spoof
of
Saturday
night
fever
.
the
sardonic
tone
of
the
proceedings
be
much
enhance
by
the
presence
of
bill
murray
,
as
the
delectably
slimy
big
ern
mcracken
.
it
be
thanks
to
murray
that
the
first
quarter
of
kingpin
seem
so
good
-
he
give
the
wry
,
derisive
edge
to
this
otherwise
rather
unfocused
comedy
.
mccracken
dupe
munson
into
a
hustle
job
,
then
abandon
he
to
a
angry
mob
who
mangle
roy
's
hand
.
then
it
be
fast
forward
17
year
later
when
munson
be
a
fat
,
balding
loser
with
a
prosthetic
rubber
hand
.
he
be
hopeless
until
he
meet
ishmael
-lrb-
randy
quaid
-rrb-
,
a
amish
amateur
bowler
that
munson
take
on
as
protege
.
so
together
they
set
out
for
the
million
dollar
bowling
tournament
in
reno
,
pick
up
pretty
hustler
claudium
-lrb-
vanessa
angel
-rrb-
on
the
way
.
with
the
exit
of
bill
murray
,
the
filmmaker
seem
to
have
only
one
direction
to
go
,
and
that
be
...
dumb
and
dumber
.
yes
,
indeed
,
kingpin
be
bring
to
you
by
those
modern
proponent
of
laxative
humor
,
peter
and
bobby
farrelly
,
the
director
of
the
aforementioned
jim
carrey
vehicle
.
so
,
prepare
for
much
slaparound
comedy
with
fly
rubber
hand
,
distended
nipple
,
ridiculous
hair
and
bull
semen
.
get
set
for
stock
fish-out-of-water
situation
when
city-boy
roy
put
on
a
beard
and
try
to
blend
in
with
the
amish
community
,
or
when
suaku
straitlaced
ishmael
take
on
smoking
,
striptease
and
unchristian
neighbour-socking
.
now
,
do
not
get
I
wrong
,
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
cheap
humor
,
and
i
have
my
fair
share
of
lavatorial
laugh
with
woody
and
randy
.
the
trouble
be
that
these
joke
be
not
bold
or
funny
enough
to
drive
a
movie
that
bumble
along
without
much
sense
of
direction
.
it
lurch
from
sport
movie
to
amish-mocking
to
road-trip
to
sentimental
melodrama
,
-lrb-
pause
for
a
broadside
spoof
of
indecent
proposal
,
and
many
shameless
plug
for
the
accompany
pop
soundtrack
-rrb-
,
never
quite
get
it
all
together
.
some
gag
fall
flat
from
a
lack
of
build-up
,
while
there
be
bit
and
piece
in
the
movie
that
simply
do
not
do
anything
.
why
the
long
,
unfunny
fight
in
the
car
park
?
why
two
of
these
?
why
do
that
guy
wear
mascara
,
or
that
guy
have
a
glass
bowling
ball
with
a
rose
in
it
?
the
film
be
full
of
these
half-thought-through
idea
that
give
the
impression
of
any
old
gaffer
,
grip
or
makeup
artist
throw
in
random
stuff
and
say
,
''
would
not
that
be
funny
?
''
.
well
,
no
,
actually
.
the
actor
do
not
do
the
movie
much
favor
either
.
woody
harrelson
come
off
okay
,
plausibly
act
dumb
,
smart
,
cynical
or
innocent
when
the
implausible
script
call
for
it
,
but
randy
quaid
be
a
ceaseless
ham
,
and
vanessa
angel
have
no
talent
-lrb-
like
schwarzenegger
,
she
seem
more
convincing
play
a
computer-creation
than
a
human
--
take
the
tv
series
weird
science
...
please
-rrb-
.
even
murray
ham
it
up
when
he
reappear
in
the
movie
's
climax
.
all
in
all
,
a
fairly
useless
attempt
at
comedy
,
and
a
certified
no-hoper
at
kickstart
the
bowling
renaissance
.
we
'll
have
to
look
to
a
reinspired
john

perhaps
somebody
from
