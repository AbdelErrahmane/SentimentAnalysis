deliberately
delude
you
from
the
really
important
and
complex
issue
:
alienation
,
despair

loneliness

and
what
awesome
power
and
strength

actually

to
overcome

and

be
not
that

addict

watch

after

.
it
be
simply
too
light
,
simplify
and
unnecessary
sweet
to

but
the
worst
thing
about

be
that
it
actually
think

that
it

as
if
be
the
revelation
of
the
century
.
and
that
be
how
simple
it
be
!
in
fact
i
would
rather
watch
`
lose
in
space
'
once
again
,
than
return
to
'28
day
'
.
as
for
act
,
it
be
acceptable
,
but
hardly
anything
else
.
for
sandra
bullock
it
be
a
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
she
be
capable
of
more
than
`
speed
'
.
she
handle
she
part
with
a
surprising
professionalism
and
ease
that
certainly
save
the
film
from
be
a
complete
flop
.
dominic
west
shine
as
the
source
of
gwenie
's
devilish
temptation
,
but
elizabeth
perkin
'
and
steve
buscemus
's
great
talent
be
waste
on
unnoticeable
and
shallow
character
.
although
intellectually
`
girl
,
interrupted
'
be
a
greater
achievement
,
'28
day
'
be
superior
in
its
visual
aspect
.
there
be
some
nice
flash
back
sequence
and
occasionally
impressive
pacing
,
but
the
overall
technical
aspect
of
this
film
be
on
the
ground
floor
.
the
most
important
thing
be
that
we
have
see
it
before
and
it
be
a
lot
better
.
`
clean
and
sober
'
,
`
only
when
i
laugh
'
,
`
when
a
man
love
a
woman
'
,
`
leave
las
vegas
'
and
many
other
stronger
film
be
make
about
the
same
issue
.
so
what
be
the
point
?
in
other
word
'28
day
'
do
not
contribute
to
the
moviemaking
business
on
any
level
.
if
you
be
catch
in
a
snowstorm
or
bolt
of
lightning
fall
from
the
sky
and
you
be
stand
in
front
of
the
movie
theater
,
you
might
as
well
go
in
and
watch
'28
day
'
.
under
all
other
circumstance
stay
away
,
because
this
film
equal
$
8
and
103
minute
lose
.
