all
right
,
all
right
,
we
get
the
point
:
despite
all
similarity
to
the
best-selling
story
,
speechless
be
\*
not
\*
base
on
the
romance
between
1992
presidential
campaign
rival
jame
carville
and
mary
matalin
.
in
fact
,
the
script
be
in
development
well
before
1992
.
still
,
the
comparison
be
inevitable
,
until
one
realize
a
critical
difference
.
no
,
it
be
not
that
the
speechless
twosome
be
speech
writer
,
not
campaign
manager
;
it
be
that
carville
and
matalin
's
story
be
actually
interesting
.
speechless
be
a
limp
,
poorly
structure
would-be
romantic
comedy
.
speechless
be
set
during
a
new
mexico
senatorial
campaign
,
where
kevin
vallick
-lrb-
michael
keaton
-rrb-
and
julium
mann
-lrb-
geena
davi
-rrb-
meet
and
get
romantic
one
night
when
neither
one
can
sleep
.
what
neither
one
realize
be
that
they
be
on
opposite
side
of
the
campaign
:
kevin
be
a
sit-com
writer
bring
in
to
punch
up
the
republican
candidate
's
speech
,
while
julium
be
the
chief
speech
writer
for
the
democratic
candidate
.
at
first
each
one
believe
that
the
other
have
a
ulterior
motive
for
the
relationship
,
but
eventually
they
let
down
they
guard
and
become
closer
.
but
there
be
plent
of
obstacle
in
the
way
,
include
julium
's
stud-reporter
fiance
-lrb-
christopher
reeve
-rrb-
and
a
series
of
stunt
which
continue
to
prove
that
all
be
fair
in
love
and
politics
.
the
standard
formulum
for
a
movie
like
speechless
would
have
the
two
principle
start
out
as
antagonist
and
realize
only
at
the
end
that
they
be
crazy
about
each
other
.
screenwriter
robert
king
completely
subvert
expectation
by
throw
kevin
and
julium
into
each
other
's
arm
in
the
first
fifteen
minute
,
then
develop
the
antagonism
.
it
be
a
noble
attempt
to
shake
thing
up
,
but
unfortunately
it
just
do
not
work
.
part
of
the
fun
of
watch
sparring
in
a
romantic
comedy
come
from
recognize
the
chemistry
even
before
the
character
do
,
but
in
speechless
they
already
know
they
be
attract
to
each
other
,
and
we
be
leave
with
wait
for
the
campaign
to
end
so
they
'll
admit
that
they
love
each
other
already
.
there
be
such
a
herky-jerky
feel
to
the
constant
bickering
and
make
up
that
even
king
's
sharp
dialogue
can
not
prevent
speechless
from
become
repetitive
after
about
half
a
hour
.
inconsistency
be
also
the
define
characteristic
of
the
performance
of
geena
davi
and
michael
keaton
,
and
with
those
performance
most
of
they
scene
together
.
the
problem
begin
with
they
initial
courtship
,
which
do
virtually
nothing
to
establish
julium
's
character
and
merely
establish
that
kevin
be
a
wise-ass
.
davi
be
radiantly
beautiful
,
and
keaton
be
generally
entertaining
,
but
these
character
be
so
plastic
that
nothing
that
happen
to
they
seem
to
matter
one
bit
.
in
a
couple
of
scene
,
like
a
quiet
moment
sit
at
a
fountain
,
they
actually
achieve
some
measure
of
connection
.
for
the
most
part
,
however
,
they
be
just
actor
spout
line
.
you
keep
wait
for
a
little
spark
,
and
it
never
happen
.
perhaps
most
disappointing
be
that
king
and
director
ron
underwood
completely
waste
they
premise
by
remove
all
the
punch
from
speechless
's
politics
.
the
setting
seem
perfect
for
a
high
-
energy
battle
of
the
sex
with
partisanship
throw
into
the
mix
,
but
that
be
never
the
tone
that
underwood
be
go
for
.
he
want
a
warm
,
fuzzy
romance
compatible
with
marc
shaiman
's
flute-and-wind
musical
score
,
and
the
campaign
which
should
have
define
the
conflict
between
kevin
and
julium
fade
into
the
background
.
it
might
as
well
have
be
a
story
about
rival
grocer
,
and
every
single
character
be
about
as
uninspired
as
he
or
she
could
possibly
be
.
i
be
about
the
only
reviewer
in
the
civilized
world
who
seem
to
enjoy
robert
king
's
previous
screenplay
,
the
dana
carvey
flop
clean
slate
,
so
i
have
some
hope
for
speechless
.
but
while
there
be
wit
in
the
word
,
this
be
a
script
which
be
probably
much
better
on
paper
.
on
screen
,
it
be
still
paper
thin
.
