as
the
twin
surfer
dude
,
stew
and
phil
deedle
,
lay
bandage
and
unconscious
in
the
hospital
,
phil
come
to
first
and
choose
the
coolest
way
to
wake
he
brother
.
yank
out
he
iv
,
he
use
it
like
a
water
pistol
to
soak
he
brother
's
face
.
this
bit
of
lame
physical
humor
be
typical
of
disney
's
meet
the
deedle
,
a
movie
more
to
be
endure
that
watch
.
-lrb-
i
stop
look
at
my
wife
during
the
screening
,
since
every
time
i
do
,
she
would
start
stick
she
finger
in
she
throat
.
and
she
be
right
,
it
be
that
bad
.
-rrb-
direct
without
any
imagination
by
steve
boyum
,
whose
long
background
in
film
be
mainly
in
stunt
and
in
second
unit
direction
,
the
film
limp
along
at
best
.
boyum
attempt
to
keep
the
pace
move
by
stage
stunt
,
stunt
and
more
stunt
.
amazingly
for
someone
with
he
background
,
he
seem
incapable
of
find
any
fresh
one
,
and
we
have
a
car
go
off
the
road
five
different
time
--
maybe
more
.
but
who
be
count
?
and
then
there
be
the
script
by
jame
herzfeld
,
whose
only
other
film
,
tapehead
from
a
decade
ago
,
be
so
awful
that
it
be
consider
a
cult
classic
.
meet
the
deedle
,
however
,
be
painfully
bad
rather
than
laughably
bad
.
it
will
probably
be
in
and
out
of
the
theater
like
a
tornado
and
be
in
no
danger
of
become
a
classic
anything
.
herzfeld
treat
we
to
gratingly
abysmal
dialog
that
include
''
you
geyser
's
a
geezer
,
''
and
''
i
would
like
to
put
a
deedle
in
she
haystack
.
''
as
the
movie
open
,
the
twin
,
who
at
one
point
describe
themselves
modestly
as
''
a
walk
kodak
moment
,
''
be
celebrate
they
18th
birthday
.
as
they
ride
a
parasail
high
above
the
water
of
waikikus
,
a
truant
officer
pursue
they
on
he
jet
ski
.
as
heir
to
the
fabulous
fortune
of
the
deedle
empire
,
the
boy
be
send
by
they
father
to
camp
broken
spirit
at
yellowstone
to
transform
the
two
laid-back
beach
bum
into
man
.
as
they
arrive
in
they
wetsuit
in
yellowstone
,
they
have
get
they
surfboard
,
skateboard
,
and
a
hawaiian
drink
machine
the
size
of
a
armoire
.
they
camp
have
go
out
of
business
,
but
they
be
mistake
for
new
park
ranger
.
the
rest
of
the
movie
have
they
fight
the
park
's
overpopulation
of
prairie
dog
as
well
as
a
deranged
ex-ranger
,
play
by
denni
hopper
,
who
be
out
to
stop
old
faithful
before
its
billionth
birthday
celebration
,
schedule
for
later
in
the
week
.
hopper
,
who
have
make
some
wonderful
movie
,
carry
away
be
a
recent
favorite
,
do
have
a
propensity
for
choose
some
truly
odoriferous
material
.
this
be
not
he
worst
acting
,
but
meet
the
deedle
be
arguably
the
worst
movie
he
be
ever
be
in
.
steve
van
wormer
and
paul
walker
,
as
stew
and
phil
,
give
lifeless
performance
.
the
only
actor
in
the
movie
with
any
demonstrable
talent
be
a
cute
little
prairie
dog
name
petey
.
even
the
cinematography
by
david
henning
be
so
prosaic
that
it
manage
to
make
yellowstone
look
dull
.
to
add
insult
to
injury
,
henning
be
fond
of
inappropriate
close-up
,
which
only
serve
to
remind
we
of
the
inanity
of
the
dialog
.
put
a
ten-foot
pair
of
lip
on
the
screen
,
and
you
naturally
pay
extra
attention
to
what
be
say
.
although
boyum
say
in
the
note
that
he
be
proud
that
he
film
be
appropriate
for
family
,
one
wonder
how
many
skateboarder
will
attempt
the
movie
's
stunt
of
lie
on
you
back
on
a
skateboard
while
negotiate
a
busy
and
twist
mountain
road
.
they
make
it
look
like
so
much
fun
that
i
be
sure
many
will
try
some
variation
of
the
stunt
.
''
how
could
this
possibly
be
worst
,
''
ask
phil
.
just
when
you
suspect
it
can
not
,
the
movie
take
a
turn
further
downhill
.
its
low
point
may
have
you
look
for
a
airline
barf
bag
.
after
phil
's
girlfriend
dig
up
a
big
mount
of
moist
soil
,
they
suck
in
a
long
worm
.
like
the
two
dog
lover
eat
spaghetti
in
lady
and
the
tramp
,
they
lip
finally
meet
in
a
kiss
.
as
they
pull
back
,
they
face
be
full
of
the
dirt
that
encase
the
worm
they
have
just
ingest
.
meet
the
deedle
run
about
a
hour
and
a
half
.
it
be
rate
pg
for
a
little
bathroom
humor
and
would
be
acceptable
for
kid
around
6
and
up
.
my
son
jeffrey
and
he
friend
nickola
,
both
almost
9
,
give
the
show
\*
\*
\*
.
they
both
think
the
scene
with
petey
be
among
they
favorite
.
nickola
also
mention
the
scene
in
which
the
circus
bear
drive
a
jeep
,
and
jeffrey
especially
like
the
one
in
which
the
circus
elephant
be
refer
to
as
dumbo
.
