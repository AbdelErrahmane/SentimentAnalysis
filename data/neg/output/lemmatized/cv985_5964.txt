boy
,
what
a
great
movie
!
!
keanu
reeve
and
morgan
freeman
act
together
,
the
director
of
the
fugitive
-lrb-
andrew
davi
-rrb-
back
again
to
give
we
another
thriller
,
and
the
beautiful
rachel
steal
beauty
weisz
throw
in
to
boot
.
how
could
this
not
be
a
blockbuster
?
all
die-hard
keanu
reeve
fan
,
read
on
.
ol
''
much
ado
about
nothing
''
play
eddie
kasalivich
,
a
machinist
study
at
the
university
of
chicago
.
to
help
pay
for
the
rent
,
he
take
on
this
job
make
the
machinery
for
a
hydrogen
project
be
conduct
by
the
university
.
by
happy
coincidence
,
he
also
happen
to
stumble
on
the
solution
to
the
final
problem
and
thus
be
the
only
one
who
know
the
key
to
perform
this
feat
of
miracle
physics
.
this
project
hold
great
promise
:
take
hydrogen
from
water
and
give
out
more
energy
than
be
put
in
.
a
potential
solution
to
the
earth
's
energy
problem
without
the
pollution
cost
.
surely
nobody
could
have
any
problem
with
that
?
morgan
freeman
be
paul
shannon
,
the
project
's
sponsor
.
he
work
for
a
very
powerful
organization
that
disagree
with
the
paternal
project
leader
as
to
how
quickly
technology
should
be
release
to
the
public
.
he
figure
the
world
will
disintegrate
into
anarchy
if
the
result
of
the
project
be
release
too
quickly
.
so
he
murder
the
project
leader
,
blow
up
the
project
-lrb-
great
but
short
scene
here
,
sort
of
like
a
mini
id4
city-devastation
thing
-rrb-
and
try
to
simulate
the
experiment
at
some
other
hi-tech
hush-hush
location
.
unfortunately
,
we
intrepid
machinist
and
a
english
physicist
-lrb-
weisz
-rrb-
manage
to
get
away
and
now
follow
a
fugitive-like
chase
use
a
not
too
dissimilar
rehash
of
that
movie
script
.
this
movie
be
just
die
for
a
comparison
with
''
the
fugitive
''
.
both
movie
use
chicago
as
the
main
city
and
since
the
place
do
not
change
much
,
i
guess
we
can
not
really
blame
the
setting
for
the
paucity
of
atmosphere
.
the
trouble
here
be
that
where
the
fugitive
have
harrison
ford
and
tommy
lee
jone
,
chain
reaction
only
have
keanu
reeve
and
fred
ward
.
credit
to
they
,
but
we
be
not
really
give
much
of
a
chance
to
empathise
with
the
character
.
where
ford
be
able
to
work
within
the
confines
of
the
movie
to
evoke
sympathy
,
eddie
kasalivich
just
doesn9t
seem
very
believeable
and
reeve
'
character
be
never
give
the
time
to
develop
.
it
might
have
be
a
better
investment
in
film
to
give
the
character
more
depth
and
spend
less
time
on
the
chase
sequence
,
which
frankly
,
get
quite
boring
after
a
while
.
harrison
ford
be
''
the
man
against
the
world
.
''
he
be
alone
in
a
world
where
he
do
not
know
who
to
trust
and
it
come
across
real
well
.
in
chain
reaction
,
keanu
reeve
be
not
alone
.
now
that
would
be
fine
if
the
flee
couple
have
some
chemistry
and
could
really
portray
some
paranoia
,
vulnerability
and
confusion
.
we
do
not
get
this
.
we
get
he
think
he
be
still
in
speed
,
only
now
we
sandra
bullock
have
a
english
accent
,
probably
do
not
drive
a
bus
,
and
hardly
contribute
anything
to
the
movie
.
the
producer
here
probably
think
,
''
hey
,
what
if
keanu
and
rachel
do
not
hit
it
off
too
well
?
let
's
rope
in
that
morgan
to
help
we
out
.
''
well
,
keanu
and
rachel
do
not
hit
it
off
well
on
the
screen
,
and
most
unfortunately
,
morgan
freeman
do
not
help
much
either
.
the
only
thing
we
come
to
really
know
of
paul
shannon
be
that
he
always
have
a
full
load
of
cigar
in
he
cigar
holder
.
it
be
not
really
he
fault
.
once
again
,
andrew
davi
just
do
not
take
the
time
to
build
he
character
.
someone
must
have
convince
he
that
this
time
round
,
cinema
dollar
be
best
earn
by
make
the
movie
run
like
a
headless
chicken
