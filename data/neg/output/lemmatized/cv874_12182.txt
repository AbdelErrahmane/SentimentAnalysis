''
tarzan
and
the
lose
city
''
be
one
of
the
most
anemic
movie
to
come
out
in
quite
a
while
.
not
only
it
be
poorly
write
,
badly
act
,
and
generally
incompetent
in
all
cinematic
area
,
it
be
thoroughly
uninspired
and
insipid
.
unfortunately
,
it
be
not
bad
in
the
way
great
,
colossal
misfire
like
''
heaven
's
gate
''
-lrb-
1980
-rrb-
or
''
ishtar
''
-lrb-
1987
-rrb-
be
bad
.
instead
,
it
literally
drip
off
the
screen
like
a
movie
nobody
want
to
be
associate
with
,
which
beg
the
question
of
why
it
be
make
in
the
first
place
.
with
all
the
good
script
lie
around
hollywood
un-produced
,
how
do
needless
drek
like
this
make
its
way
to
the
big
screen
?
of
course
,
tarzan
be
one
of
the
most
film
character
in
all
of
motion
picture
history
-
he
have
appear
in
over
forty
film
,
which
have
range
from
the
very
good
-lrb-
1984
's
''
greystoke
:
the
legend
of
tarzan
,
lord
of
the
ape
''
-rrb-
down
to
the
really
bad
-lrb-
1981
's
''
tarzan
,
the
ape
man
''
with
bo
derek
-rrb-
.
most
of
these
film
be
just
cheapie
b-movie
make
in
the
thirty
and
forty
,
star
ex-olympic
athlete
and
a
lot
of
cutsie
chimp
.
therefore
,
if
another
tarzan
movie
be
to
be
make
,
one
might
assume
that
it
would
have
something
new
to
offer
-
a
different
angle
,
a
original
storyline
,
anything
to
set
it
apart
from
all
the
other
.
''
greystoke
''
add
a
never-before-seen
level
of
realism
to
the
pulpy
tale
,
and
even
''
tarzan
,
the
ape
man
''
at
least
have
the
mis-guided
audacity
to
sexualize
the
story
as
a
vehicle
for
bo
derek
's
bare
breast
.
''
tarzan
and
the
lose
city
,
''
on
the
other
hand
,
have
absolutely
nothing
to
offer
but
a
bunch
of
recycled
storyline
and
bad
dialogue
.
the
script
,
by
bayard
johnson
and
j
.
anderson
black
be
about
as
formulaic
and
generic
as
they
come
.
comic
book
have
better
plot
than
this
.
the
movie
be
so
bad
,
in
fact
,
that
it
retain
that
ridiculous
tarzan
call
that
be
so
tirelessly
mock
in
last
summer
's
comedy
''
george
of
the
jungle
.
''
do
not
the
producer
think
to
leave
that
back
in
the
old
weissmuller
picture
where
it
belong
?
the
story
start
with
the
legend
of
tarzan
already
firmly
establish
:
a
quick
opening
narration
tell
of
tarzan
-lrb-
casper
van
dien
-rrb-
be
find
in
the
jungle
after
have
be
raise
by
ape
,
and
he
return
to
england
where
he
assume
he
greystoke
heritage
.
when
the
movie
start
in
1913
,
he
be
a
civilized
english
gentleman
-lrb-
without
a
english
accent
-rrb-
,
and
he
be
to
marry
jane
-lrb-
jane
march
-rrb-
in
less
than
a
week
.
however
,
when
a
wicked
archeologist\/grave-robber
name
nigel
raven
-lrb-
steve
waddington
-rrb-
begin
hunting
for
the
fabled
lost
city
of
opar
,
one
of
africa
's
last
great
secret
,
the
witch
doctor
of
a
ancient
african
tribe
summons
tarzan
back
to
the
jungle
.
at
first
,
jane
refuse
to
go
,
pout
about
how
it
will
interfere
with
they
wedding
;
but
after
tarzan
leaf
she
change
she
mind
and
track
he
down
,
therefore
assure
lot
of
lame
smooch
scene
between
she
and
she
ape-man
.
once
the
film
get
go
-lrb-
in
its
own
sluggish
way
-rrb-
,
it
delve
into
a
series
of
jungle
adventure
,
as
tarzan
,
jane
,
and
the
native
attempt
the
thwart
raven
and
he
crew
from
discover
the
city
.
most
of
the
so-called
adventure
be
cheesy
,
predictable
,
and
unexciting
,
with
no
pace
,
tension
,
or
action
to
speak
of
.
there
be
sequence
steal
from
innumerable
recent
adventure
movie
,
range
from
''
raider
of
the
lose
ark
''
-lrb-
1981
-rrb-
to
''
the
goony
''
-lrb-
1985
-rrb-
.
when
the
movie
be
run
short
on
action
,
it
include
a
few
greenpeace-friendly
scene
of
tarzan
free
caged
animal
,
release
a
baby
elephant
from
a
trap
,
and
throw
ivory
tusk
into
the
river
.
the
movie
be
also
lack
even
a
remote
hint
of
reality
.
for
instance
,
when
tarzan
-
who
be
raise
in
the
jungle
-
be
bite
by
a
cobra
,
he
do
not
even
attempt
to
suck
the
venom
out
like
any
semi-experienced
weekend
backpacker
would
do
.
instead
,
he
tie
a
tourniquet
around
he
arm
and
stumble
off
into
the
jungle
with
no
plan
for
survival
.
of
course
,
one
can
not
help
but
notice
how
fundamentally
mislead
the
title
be
.
not
to
ruin
the
end
or
anything
,
but
there
be
no
lost
city
.
there
be
,
however
,
a
lose
pyramid
,
which
i
suppose
be
all
the
resource-strapped
fx
department
could
come
up
with
-lrb-
the
special
effect
be
not
worthy
of
a
made-for-tv
movie
-rrb-
.
which
also
bring
up
the
question
of
why
the
treasure
hunter
have
to
slog
through
numerous
underground
cavern
to
get
to
the
lose
pyramid
,
when
it
be
sit
right
out
in
the
middle
of
a
open
field
?
strictly
speak
,
''
tarzan
and
the
lose
city
''
be
not
even
bad
enough
to
have
camp
quality
,
although
casper
van
dien
's
laughably
stiff
performance
come
real
close
.
this
movie
prove
what
''
starship
trooper
''
only
hint
at
:
he
can
not
act
,
but
he
sure
look
well-groomed
,
even
in
the
deepest
heart
of
the
african
jungle
.
van
dien
be
much
too
much
of
a
pretty-boy
to
be
a
effective
tarzan
;
he
be
a
calvin
klein
model
in
a
loin
cloth
.
i
also
wonder
what
the
make-up
department
be
think
when
it
outfit
he
with
that
awful
circa-1983
steve
perry
haircut
.
waddington
make
a
decent
villain
,
although
he
be
like
a
charmless
version
of
belloq
from
''
raider
of
the
lose
ark
.
''
as
jane
,
the
ex-model
jane
march
have
little
to
do
but
smile
and
look
pretty
next
to
tarzan
.
she
do
fire
off
a
gun
at
the
evil
treasure
hunter
a
time
or
two
,
but
whenever
a
snake
come
into
the
picture
,
she
be
reduce
to
a
hysterical
mess
.
however
,
amidst
all
this
complain
,
i
do
have
one
piece
of
good
news
.
''
tarzan
and
the
lose
city
''
be
so
lack
in
idea
both
new
and
old
,
that
it
be
unable
to
fill
even
a
hour
and
a
half
of
celluloid
.
so
,
we
can
say
this
much
for
it
:
at
least
it
have
the
decency
to
be
short
.
