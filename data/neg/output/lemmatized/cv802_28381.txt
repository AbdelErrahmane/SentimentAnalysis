if
you
have
be
follow
william
fichtner
's
career
-lrb-
and
there
be
absolutely
no
reason
why
you
should
have
-rrb-
,
you
might
have
notice
that
he
be
play
some
rather
similar
role
over
the
year
.
like
sully
in
''
the
perfect
storm
''
--
tough
,
gruff
,
and
a
little
bit
scary
.
or
law
in
''
albino
alligator
''
--
tough
,
gruff
,
and
little
bit
scarier
.
or
colonel
william
sharp
in
''
armageddon
,
''
or
dwayne
engelman
in
''
strange
day
,
''
or
even
he
brief
appearance
towards
the
beginning
of
''
pearl
harbor
,
''
as
the
abusive
father
of
danny
--
here
be
a
actor
who
gravitate
towards
tough
,
gruff
,
hard-hitting
role
.
which
be
why
he
performance
in
''
what
be
the
worst
that
could
happen
?
''
be
such
a
shock
,
such
a
delight
.
in
the
film
,
fichtner
play
a
blonde
haired
,
meticulously
dress
,
overtly
effeminate
,
dog-loving
detective
.
as
alex
tardio
,
fichtner
's
performance
border
on
caricature
but
go
beyond
it
.
it
border
on
offensive
but
do
not
really
manage
it
.
and
it
border
on
clich
?
d
stereotype
but
do
not
quite
succumb
to
that
definition
either
.
in
a
role
so
diametrically
oppose
to
what
the
actor
have
play
before
we
should
have
see
it
coming
,
fichtner
be
not
perfect
--
you
can
see
he
struggle
a
little
at
time
,
concentrate
a
little
too
hard
on
the
look
as
he
swish
he
hand
through
the
air
,
or
nuzzle
a
coiffed
canine
up
close
and
personal
--
but
he
be
pretty
damned
good
,
and
silly
,
and
without
question
the
best
thing
in
the
film
.
in
fact
,
have
it
not
be
for
fitchner
's
sudden
and
bizarre
appearance
,
and
he
jarring
screen
presence
thereafter
,
i
would
have
walk
out
,
for
''
what
be
the
worst
that
could
happen
?
''
be
mesmerizing
in
its
awfulness
,
a
poorly
write
,
haphazardly
edit
,
and
totally
unfunny
-lrb-
yes
,
it
star
martin
lawrence
and
danny
devito
so
how
could
that
be
possible
?
-rrb-
moviegoing
experience
.
fichtner
's
performance
do
not
exactly
save
the
film
,
and
it
be
not
like
i
be
recommend
''
what
be
the
worst
that
could
happen
?
''
solely
on
the
strength
of
the
actor
's
dramatic
turnaround
,
but
he
contribution
do
raise
the
film
's
rating
from
no
star
to
one-and-a-half
.
thumb
up
to
fichtner
then
,
and
thumb
down
--
way
,
way
,
down
--
to
everyone
else
involve
in
this
sorry
mess
,
a
movie
so
dull
and
pedestrian
and
nonsensical
it
do
not
even
warrant
discussion
.
