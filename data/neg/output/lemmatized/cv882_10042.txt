there
be
many
philosophy
as
to
why
we
be
so
fascinate
with
cartoon
.
they
provide
a
method
of
total
escapism
in
which
anything
will
work
within
they
context
,
from
the
outrageous
slapstick
of
looney
tune
to
the
intensity
of
japanimation
.
watch
''
flubber
''
really
clinch
this
idea
for
I
,
because
it
be
just
a
live
action
cartoon
that
present
itself
as
a
regular
comedy
.
it
prove
how
painfully
unfunny
all
those
gag
and
slapstick
would
be
in
reality
,
and
how
important
it
be
to
actually
have
a
story
.
the
film
waste
no
time
in
establish
its
lighthearted
,
cartoony
atmosphere
.
we
meet
medfield
college
chemistry
professor
phillip
brainard
-lrb-
william
-rrb-
,
the
typical
,
supposedly
likable
mad
scientist
.
within
the
first
10
minute
we
get
at
least
a
half
dozen
joke
about
how
forgetful
he
be
.
phillip
's
memory
loss
seem
less
like
a
cartoony
gag
and
more
like
a
real
case
of
alzhiemer
's
disease
-
be
not
this
rather
lowbrow
comedy
?
he
start
teaching
chemistry
after
walk
in
on
a
nude
figure
draw
class
-lrb-
a
inappropriate
joke
for
a
kid
'
movie
if
i
ever
see
one
-rrb-
.
we
learn
he
have
stand
he
up
fiancee
,
sara
-lrb-
harden
-rrb-
,
twice
at
the
altar
simply
because
he
be
forget
.
sara
claim
to
love
he
,
but
say
if
he
forget
the
wedding
again
she
'll
stop
love
he
-lrb-
a
sign
of
childish
attitude
the
film
deny
it
have
-rrb-
.
but
even
cartoon
must
have
conflict
to
resolve
,
and
it
be
no
surprise
the
major
conflict
here
be
related
.
christopher
mcdonald
do
and
even
worse
version
of
he
usual
villain
shtick
as
wilson
croft
,
a
scientist
who
not
only
want
to
steal
phillip
's
idea
,
but
he
woman
too
.
what
be
worse
be
that
sara
actually
seem
interested
in
he
!
wilson
work
for
a
rival
college
that
want
to
buy
out
medfield
,
which
be
go
broke
,
unless
phillip
can
invent
something
to
save
the
day
.
one
of
the
first
rule
of
filmmaking
be
to
make
sure
the
title
have
something
to
do
with
the
film
.
the
flubber
be
play
for
gag
after
it
be
introduce
,
but
be
all
but
forget
about
thereafter
.
it
be
obvious
phillip
be
go
to
accidentally
invent
flubber
,
a
fly
rubber
compound
that
yield
tremendous
energy
,
and
the
promotion
make
the
flubber
look
realistic
and
funny
.
unfortunately
,
the
flubber
,
like
all
the
special
effect
in
this
film
,
look
very
fake
and
unconvincing
.
flubber
also
seem
to
have
intelligence
and
a
personality
,
and
by
the
time
it
perform
a
song
and
dance
routine
,
you
give
up
wonder
how
life
could
spontaneously
come
to
a
inanimate
object
.
most
of
the
film
wander
aimlessly
as
it
rely
on
the
flubber
to
make
for
the
comedy
-lrb-
since
phillip
's
absent-mindedness
be
forget
about
-rrb-
and
somehow
push
the
story
along
.
but
it
be
clear
how
weak
this
premise
be
from
the
get-go
and
the
film
just
get
worse
.
all
the
joke
involve
people
get
hit
by
fast-moving
,
flubber-powered
object
include
:
bowling
ball
;
fly
car
that
do
not
fly
well
;
and
a
basketball
team
capable
of
jump
100
foot
into
the
air
.
it
be
all
present
with
complete
logic
,
and
no
one
believe
flubber
exist
even
when
they
see
it
with
they
own
eye
.
during
the
basketball
scene
,
the
coach
for
the
rival
team
actually
say
,
''
i
think
they
might
be
cheating
,
''
to
which
the
referee
reply
,
''
there
be
no
rule
about
jump
too
high
.
''
''
predictable
''
do
not
begin
to
describe
the
motion
the
film
go
through
,
especially
after
the
halfway
point
.
and
it
be
not
how
terribly
contrived
the
plot
be
,
it
be
the
way
it
be
break
down
scene-by-scene
,
with
absolutely
no
transition
.
not
only
that
,
but
all
the
actor
here
,
especially
william
,
seem
bore
to
tear
.
i
would
say
80
percent
of
all
the
scene
be
shoot
with
a
bluescreen
,
so
it
be
almost
forgivable
when
you
realize
they
be
talk
to
nothing
and
interact
with
nothing
.
it
be
safe
to
say
everything
that
could
be
bad
about
''
flubber
''
be
.
the
only
original
element
the
film
have
be
the
world
's
first
romance
between
a
machine
and
a
human
.
but
this
aspect
be
quite
twist
if
you
think
about
it
,
and
,
like
the
rest
of
the
film
,
you
will
not
.
