for
a
film
tout
as
explore
relationship
and
black
sexuality
,
troi
be
surprisingly
tame
.
despite
it
be
lurid
subject
matter
and
it
be
pass
nod
to
fatal
attraction
,
it
move
along
with
flat
,
uninspired
dialogue
as
it
set
up
a
surprising
climax
that
try
mightily
to
overthrow
the
considerable
dead
weight
of
the
rest
of
the
film
.
freshly
move
to
atlanta
,
jermaine
-lrb-
dourdan
-rrb-
and
he
wife
,
jasmine
-lrb-
moore
-rrb-
,
have
the
trappings
of
a
perfect
life
.
they
have
a
beautiful
house
in
suburbia
.
jermaine
be
a
lawyer
on
the
fast
track
at
he
firm
.
jasmine
be
he
supportive
wife
,
who
be
finish
up
she
college
degree
.
in
a
opening
montage
via
a
home
video
of
the
pair
,
we
see
the
unremarkable
story
of
they
marriage
and
early
marital
triumph
.
this
be
a
couple
that
have
it
all
.
into
this
eden
slither
the
lure
of
lust
.
despite
he
outward
appearance
,
jermaine
reveal
himself
as
selfish
and
covetous
of
he
wife
more
as
a
possession
than
a
person
.
a
glimmer
of
he
true
nature
peek
out
during
a
early
sex
scene
with
he
wife
as
he
go
about
he
business
,
oblivious
to
jasmine
's
concern
.
we
also
find
that
he
have
be
relentlessly
ask
jasmine
to
participate
in
a
menage
-
a-troi
,
much
to
jasmine
's
dismay
.
as
jermaine
put
it
,
''
do
not
you
want
to
be
sexually
free
?
''
jermaine
share
he
desire
with
co-worker
terrence
-lrb-
smith
-rrb-
,
who
obligingly
set
jermaine
up
with
a
woman
who
might
be
interested
in
just
such
a
encounter
.
the
woman
,
jade
-lrb-
palmer
-rrb-
be
a
direct
counterpoint
to
jasmine
.
jade
,
at
one
point
be
a
college
student
,
too
.
unlike
jasmine
,
she
find
herself
pregnant
,
drop
out
of
school
and
now
struggle
to
make
end
meet
.
to
further
reinforce
they
difference
,
it
be
reveal
that
jade
be
involve
in
a
custody
battle
over
she
son
.
inevitably
,
through
liquor
and
a
touch
of
duplicity
on
jermaine
's
part
,
the
forbid
act
be
consummate
.
the
aftermath
of
the
encounter
sidestep
into
fatal
attraction
territory
as
act
of
violence
be
perpetrate
upon
jermaine
's
property
with
the
hint
that
the
violence
may
escalate
.
by
this
point
,
troi
show
itself
to
be
a
soap
opera
without
the
requisite
melodrama
:
a
fatal
attraction
without
the
social
significance
.
the
exploration
of
relationship
be
strictly
superficial
and
stereotypical
.
jermaine
come
off
as
insincere
,
sexually
drive
and
selfish
.
jasmine
be
bland
and
subservient
.
jade
come
off
a
bit
sympathetically
,
but
that
be
negate
by
she
moral
bankruptcy
.
yet
another
tale
of
a
sexually
aggressive
''
dog
''
of
a
man
who
impose
he
will
upon
he
accommodate
,
innocent
mate
.
the
last
10
minute
will
undoubtly
throw
you
a
curve
,
but
by
this
point
,
will
you
even
care
?
if
the
rest
of
the
movie
be
as
dynamic
as
the
end
,
perhaps
there
could
have
be
some
freshness
to
it
.
as
it
stand
,
troi
be
pretty
standard
fare
.
