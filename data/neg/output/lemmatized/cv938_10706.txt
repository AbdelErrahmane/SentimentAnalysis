comment
:
the
most
notable
aspect
of
adrenalin
:
fear
the
rush
be
that
it
mark
a
striking
career
move
for
natasha
henstridge
.
not
only
do
she
manage
to
keep
all
she
clothes
on
-lrb-
she
trademark
in
earlier
film
such
as
species
and
maximum
risk
be
to
strip
naked
as
often
as
possible
-rrb-
,
but
she
actually
put
on
even
more
clothes
as
the
film
progress
.
this
will
probably
disappoint
many
henstridge
fan
,
but
i
welcome
the
change
because
henstridge
be
a
attractive
,
capable
actress
who
deserve
less
exploitative
role
-lrb-
though
,
i
admit
,
it
do
not
show
in
this
mess
-rrb-
.
henstridge
,
just
like
every
other
actor
in
the
film
,
deliver
a
wooden
performance
in
this
monumental
turkey
.
-lrb-
the
cast
also
include
christopher
lambert
,
who
have
appear
in
the
highlander
and
mortal
kombat
film
.
-rrb-
how
on
earth
this
movie
get
two
big-name
star
to
appear
in
it
be
beyond
I
.
adrenalin
:
fear
the
rush
be
set
in
boston
ten
year
in
the
future
-lrb-
2007
-rrb-
.
boston
have
change
dramatically
in
those
ten
year
.
it
be
now
home
to
a
bunch
of
interred
foreigner
and
police
by
cop
who
drive
around
in
small
car
with
''
policia
''
print
on
they
door
.
some
guy
have
a
really
bad
virus
,
and
he
be
kill
people
because
of
it
.
so
,
the
brave
good
guy
-lrb-
lambert
and
henstridge
-rrb-
go
after
he
.
that
be
it
.
76
minute
never
seem
so
long
.
this
be
a
drawn-out
chase
scene
through
dimly-lit
abandon
building
turn
into
a
entire
movie
.
the
plot
development
be
nil
;
we
learn
absolutely
nothing
about
lambert
's
character
and
very
little
about
henstridge
's
character
.
the
dialogue
be
litter
with
unnecessary
obscenity
and
concern
mindnumbingly
idiotic
argument
over
who
will
go
down
the
next
dark
corridor\/tunnel\/airduct
next
and
who
will
carry
the
flashlight
.
a
subplot
do
exist
involve
henstridge
's
character
's
illegal
attempt
to
get
she
son
out
of
boston
.
in
she
opening
monologue
,
a
monologue
which
sound
as
though
henstridge
be
read
from
cue
card
,
we
learn
that
she
have
go
to
great
length
to
secure
a
fake
passport
for
she
son
.
twenty
minute
into
the
film
,
i
wonder
if
the
movie
would
have
be
better
if
it
focus
on
this
plot
.
in
a
define
scene
of
the
movie
,
however
,
i
change
my
mind
.
this
fake
passport
drop
to
the
ground
.
lambert
's
cop
immediately
recognize
it
as
a
fraud
from
six
foot
away
.
must
not
have
be
a
good
fake
.
this
emphasize
another
fault
with
the
film
.
thing
just
defy
common
sense
.
lambert
's
cop
,
for
instance
,
be
shoot
seven
time
,
yet
he
be
still
able
to
talk
and
slide
about
.
adrenalin
:
fear
the
rush
end
in
a
trite
manner
that
do
not
seem
to
even
fit
the
mood
that
the
filmmaker
be
try
for
.
i
find
myself
rather
bore
with
this
film
,
which
will
disappoint
both
sci-fi\/horror
fan
and
fan
of
henstridge
and
lambert
.
do
not
fear
the
rush
.
fear
the
movie
.
watch
something
else
.
