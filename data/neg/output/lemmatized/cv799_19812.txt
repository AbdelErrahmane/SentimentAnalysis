...
the
follow
review
contain
some
harsh
language

\*
the
blair
witch
project
.
quite
possibly
the
least
scariest
movie
of
all
time
.
if
you
want
to
see
real
terror
on
the
big
screen
go
back
and
watch
any
scene
with
jar
jar
bink
in
the
phantom
menace
,
because
this
movie
be
not
scary
or
even
remotely
creepy
.
my
colleague
and
friend
chuck
dowl
write
that
if
less
be
more
,
then
the
blair
witch
filmmaker
must
have
think
that
nothing
be
more
.
and
this
work
for
he
.
well
,
i
be
sorry
,
but
nothing
...
be
nothing
!
!
!
!
!
nothing
be
not
more
.
it
be
nothiiiiiinggggggggggg
!
!
!
!
!
!
.
i
do
not
pay
5
dollar
to
see
nothing
.
''
nothing
''
be
free
,
available
all
around
the
world
at
a
location
near
you
.
i
be
absolutely
in
amazement
that
some
people
find
this
movie
scary
.
i
could
just
discount
they
and
say
,
''
well
,
i
guess
they
be
just
pansy
chicken
shit
who
be
probably
scare
of
they
own
shadow
.
''
but
i
have
intelligent
friend
who
like
this
movie
and
so
that
do
not
hold
water
.
there
must
be
some
other
reason
.
-lrb-
then
again
,
maybe
my
first
thought
be
correct
,
i
think
i
'll
try
point
they
shadow
out
to
they
one
day
and
test
they
reaction
.
-rrb-
when
i
hear
people
praise
this
film
,
i
never
hear
they
talk
about
what
make
up
about
97
%
of
this
movie
:
three
kid
bicker
with
each
other
about
be
lose
.
they
only
talk
about
what
might
make
up
possibly
3
to
4
minute
of
screen
time
.
this
be
a
few
very
short
night
scene
where
the
kid
hear
some
unscary
sound
and
another
where
they
shout
''
josh
!
!
''
over
and
over
.
this
film
should
not
be
call
the
blair
witch
project
,
it
should
more
accurately
be
call
three
dumb
and
pisspoor
filmmaker
get
lose
...
and
argue
with
each
other
.
oh
lady
and
gentleman
you
will
be
so
scared
when
you
hear
they
shout
''
josh
!
!
''
.
and
if
you
think
that
be
scary
,
wait
till
you
see
a
pile
of
rock
,
and
then
some
tinkertoy
lincoln
log
,
oh
my
dear
lord
you
will
be
piss
in
you
pants
with
fear
.
oh
yeah
,
and
some
goo
on
one
of
they
backpack
.
you
have
never
see
terror
like
this
folk
,
and
you
do
not
want
to
.
the
chevy
chase\/goldie
hawn
comedy
foul
play
be
creepier
than
this
film
.
-lrb-
for
current
film
,
i
highly
recommend
the
sixth
sense
or
a
stir
of
echo
for
a
creepy
filmgoing
experience
.
-rrb-
this
film
be
a
example
of
marketing
with
no
substance
.
the
marketing
be
brilliant
,
and
the
whole
nation
be
in
awe
of
just
the
premise
for
the
film
.
they
want
this
film
to
be
good
.
and
i
think
they
be
reach
and
praise
the
wrong
movie
because
they
do
not
have
anything
else
to
praise
.
that
wonderful
film
that
rejuvenate
the
horror
genre
may
come
along
,
but
this
be
not
it
.
this
film
could
have
be
so
much
better
.
just
think
,
if
maybe
there
have
be
only
10
minute
of
argue
about
be
lose
,
and
80
minute
of
nighttime
stuff
.
i
see
this
movie
with
a
girl
who
be
extremely
pump
for
it
.
she
be
sell
on
this
film
.
and
then
,
at
one
point
during
it
,
she
turn
to
I
and
ask
'
...
be
we
suppose
to
be
scare
by
this
?
'
.
i
have
hear
one
opinion
that
you
''
have
to
use
you
imagination
''
to
create
the
fear
in
this
movie
.
well
,
i
think
that
be
what
the
filmmaker
be
suppose
to
do
.
use
they
imagination
and
create
a
good
movie
.
i
mean
anyone
can
use
they
imagination
and
not
pay
5
buck
for
it
.
but
even
if
you
like
this
idea
,
then
what
be
you
imagine
?
a
entity
call
the
blair
witch
?
some
redneck
fuck
with
these
kid
?
be
either
of
these
thing
really
scary
when
you
think
about
it
?
?
?
i
have
hear
several
people
say
that
this
movie
make
they
recall
how
scary
it
can
be
to
be
out
in
the
wood
and
hear
something
.
well
sure
that
scary
in
real
life
,
but
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
that
be
scary
in
real
life
that
be
not
scary
in
a
movie
nor
even
interesting
.
you
could
sit
in
you
house
and
see
a
snake
or
a
spider
and
it
could
be
scary
,
but
in
a
film
it
would
not
be
.
and
no
,
a
movie
do
not
need
a
big
budget
or
cgus
special
effect
to
be
scary
or
creepy
.
actually
the
less
the
better
-lrb-
see
the
equally
awful
remake
of
the
haunting
-rrb-
.
but
you
have
to
do
something
.
you
cant
just
count
on
we
all
have
nostalgic
memory
of
how
something
like
this
could
be
scary
,
if
it
be
real
.
and
by
the
way
,
about
the
shakycam
film
in
blair
witch
.
be
not
these
suppose
to
be
''
filmmaker
''
who
should
know
how
to
point
a
camera
and
shoot
something
without
shake
the
camera
constantly
?
i
be
not
even
talk
about
the
couple
scene
where
they
be
terrify
,
that
be
justified
.
i
be
talk
about
the
other
87
minute
of
the
movie
where
they
can
not
seem
to
shoot
anything
smoothly
at
all
.
minor
quibble
there
.
there
be
a
feeling
in
I
that
the
people
that
like
this
movie
be
sucker
.
that
the
filmmaker
be
just
laugh
they
ass
off
all
the
way
to
the
bank
.
and
i
think
there
be
a
good
chance
they
will
see
this
film
again
and
say
to
themselves
''
what
be
i
think
?
?
''
.
but
,
if
they
do
not
,
then
thats
fine
.
if
it
work
for
they
then
that
be
okay
i
guess
.
i
just
lament
that
by
make
this
movie
a
hit
,
we
be
go
to
be
subject
to
more
of
the
''
nothing
be
more
''
approach
.
pretty
soon
we
be
go
to
get
some
movie
like
this
:
just
a
still
shoot
of
a
prison
jail
cell
.
for
90
minute
.
and
we
'll
have
to
use
we
imagination
and
think
to
ourselves
,
''
my
god
,
would
not
it
be
scary
to
spend
life
in
prison
?
!
!
this
movie
be
the
scariest
movie
of
all
time
!
!
!
!
!
''
.
or
,
a
shot
of
a
coffin
,
with
some
funeral
director
argue
with
each
other
.
''
man
,
do
you
know
how
scary
it
would
be
to
die
?
?
?
!
!
!
!
now
this
be
the
scariest
movie
of
all
time
!
!
!
!
