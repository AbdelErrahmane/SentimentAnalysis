''
mission
to
mar
''
be
one
of
those
annoying
movie
where
,
in
the
middle
of
the
movie
,
you
get
the
sneak
suspicion
that
the
reason
the
trailer
look
so
good
be
because
they
showcase
all
the
best
part
of
the
movie
:
all
five
minute
of
it
.
''
mission
''
\*
do
\*
give
you
payoff
;
but
when
it
do
come
,
it
be
too
little
,
too
late
.
''
mission
''
have
some
good
idea
,
but
they
get
lose
in
the
unbearably
boring
delivery
,
dime-a-dozen
dialogue
,
and
spate
of
good
actor
waste
in
cardboard-cutout
role
.
i
be
sure
the
director
and
writer
be
very
proud
of
each
hallmark
moment
they
come
up
with
,
so
they
stretch
each
dramatic
moment
out
like
silly
putty
until
it
lose
all
its
charm
.
glance
do
not
communicate
any
deeper
emotion
just
because
you
draw
they
out
for
five
hour
on
end
.
the
film
spend
a
hour
on
this
kind
of
stuff
,
build
to
its
climax
.
a
lot
of
it
be
a
cliched
glorification
of
family
relationship
,
marriage
,
friendship
,
unite
we
stand
divide
we
fall
kind
of
crap
.
there
be
some
spectacular
special
effect
sequence
in
this
film
,
and
i
give
it
point
for
try
to
stay
true
to
the
science
i
know
-lrb-
try
be
the
key
word
here
-rrb-
.
the
sequence
with
the
martian
demonstrate
they
history
be
oddly
beautiful
and
touching
,
but
as
mention
by
then
we
be
so
sick
of
the
goddamn
thing
we
want
the
movie
to
be
over
.
great
design
,
good
intention
,
but
no
cigar
.
if
you
be
not
a
die
hard
sci-fus
,
fx
or
jerry
o'connell
fan
-lrb-
he
character
be
the
only
one
who
have
some
semblance
of
character
-rrb-
,
do
not
waste
you
eight
buck
on
this
.
and
what
the
hell
,
tim
robbin
die
halfway
through
the
movie
,
in
a
stupid
way
too
.
that
be
just
unforgiveable
.
