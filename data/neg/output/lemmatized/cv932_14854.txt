the
movie
try
to
be
too
much
at
once
and
fail
at
it
all
.
it
be
not
a
over-the-top
comedy
or
a
heart-warming
message
of
humanity
.
it
_
be
_
a
mish-mosh
of
poorly
direct
scene
make
even
worse
by
insipid
dialog
.
i
be
willing
to
put
up
with
preach
from
a
film
,
but
the
message
here
be
old
hat
.
you
should
take
time
to
smell
the
rose
.
sell
you
soul
for
cash
be
a
bad
idea

glad
i
see
the
movie

i
never
would
have
think
of
these
.
the
opportunity
to
poke
fun
at
the
goofy
product
be
mostly
miss
.
when
g
take
a
chainsaw
to
the
set
,
there
be
a
obvious
chance
for
murphy
to
be
hilarious
.
it
do
not
happen
.
the
bit
be
so
subdue
and
overly-long
that
there
be
only
a
hint
of
laughter
from
the
audience
.
murphy
have
change
he
role
in
recent
year
and
not
for
the
better
.
there
be
hint
of
promise
in
this
one
.
the
only
time
the
film
pick
up
even
a
little
be
when
he
shaved-headed
character
in
the
long
flow
white

show
up
on
screen
.
the
other
be
horrendous
.
goldblum
have
episode
of
brilliance
in
he
career
,
but
here
he
seem
to
have
be
replace
with
a
lifeless
pod
from
he
''
invasion
of
the
body
snatcher
''
.
he
relationship
with
kate
make
no
sense
.
they
move
from
antagonism
to
love
somewhere
off
screen
.
preston
be
as
uninteresting
as
she
could
possibly
be
.
somewhere
hide
deep
inside
of
this
film
be
about
ten
minute
of
value
.
a
attempt
to
satirize
stupid
television
,
we
get
a
self-parody
instead
.
