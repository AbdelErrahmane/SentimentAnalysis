it
be
with
some
sad
irony
that
i
screen
fright
night
part
2
on
the
day
that
one
of
it
be
star
,
roddy
mcdowall
pass
away
at
the
age
of
70
.
mcdowall
be
one
of
the
most
talented
and
prolific
actor
in
hollywood
,
have
a
career
that
span
over
60
year
and
appear
in
more
than
100
film
.
fright
night
part
2
probably
will
not
be
count
among
he
more
memorable
role
.
this
be
really
sad
consider
how
good
the
first
fright
night
film
be
.
william
ragsdale
and
roddy
mcdowall
both
reprise
they
role
as
the
somewhat
reluctant
vampire
killer
who
seem
to
be
the
only
one
that
realize
that
vampire
walk
among
we
.
-lrb-
at
least
in
the
movie
anyway
.
-rrb-
it
have
be
several
year
since
charlie
brewster
-lrb-
ragsdale
-rrb-
and
b-movie
actor
turn
late
night
horror
film
host
,
peter
vincent
-lrb-
mcdowall
-rrb-
come
face
to
face
with
a
real
live
vampire
who
just
happen
to
be
charlie
's
next
door
neighbor
.
charlie
and
peter
win
that
battle
,
but
apparently
even
vampire
have
relative
who
get
piss
if
you
kill
member
of
they
family
.
apparently
charlie
's
former
bloodsuck
next
door
neighbor
have
a
sister
who
be
none
too
pleased
to
find
out
that
some
kid
and
a
aging
actor
stake
she
sibling
.
so
she
decide
to
exact
a
little
bit
of
revenge
.
this
end
up
force
charlie
and
peter
to
battle
the
force
of
darkness
yet
again
.
one
of
the
thing
that
make
fright
night
such
a
success
be
chris
sarandon
who
play
charlie
's
stylish
next
door
neighbor
with
a
taste
for
blood
.
fright
night
part
2
try
to
duplicate
that
modern
style
but
it
fall
sort
.
while
they
be
stylish
,
the
vamp
in
this
film
just
do
not
have
the
personality
of
the
undead
in
the
first
film
.
with
the
exception
of
a
werewolf
who
add
some
much
need
comic
relief
to
a
few
of
the
scene
.
one
bright
spot
,
speak
from
a
strictly
sexist
point
of
view
,
be
tracus
lin
,
who
play
charlie
's
very
skeptical
girlfriend
.
it
be
really
a
shame
that
she
career
have
not
be
better
since
she
make
this
film
.
ragsdale
do
a
fair
job
in
this
film
,
but
do
not
give
nearly
the
performance
that
he
do
in
the
original
.
roddy
mcdowall
make
the
most
with
what
he
be
give
,
which
unfortunately
be
not
much
which
be
a
shame
because
he
character
be
a
lot
of
fun
in
the
original
movie
.
i
guess
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
first
film
be
a
superior
product
in
every
way
.
the
original
always
leave
you
feel
danger
be
lurk
right
around
the
corner
,
part
2
have
more
of
the
feel
of
a
music
video
.
never
a
good
thing
for
a
horror
film
.
another
minus
for
part
2
be
the
traditional
scene
that
leave
the
audience
on
the
edge
of
they
seat
wait
for
something
to
jump
out
of
a
shadow
where
very
rare
.
for
that
matter
,
they
be
almost
nonexistent
.
if
i
be
go
to
watch
a
horror
film
,
this
would
be
far
from
my
first
choice
.
the
first
fright
night
,
on
the
other
hand
,
would
be
right
up
near
the
top
of
my
list
.
if
i
be
in
the
mood
for
a
roddy
mcdowall
film
i
would
probably
head
to
the
science
fiction
section
of
my
local
video
store
and
rent
planet
of
the
ape
.
either
way
fright
night
part
2
would
most
likely
not
enter
into
the
equation
.
