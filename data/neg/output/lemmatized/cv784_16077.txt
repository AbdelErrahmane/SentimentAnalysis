''
varsity
blues
''
be
the
best
film
of
1999
thus
far
.
unfortunately
,
it
be
also
the
first
film
i
have
see
from
1999
.
it

it
be
another
one
of
those
small-town
sport
movie
that
involve
a
flawed
,
but
good-hearted
protagonist
;
a
rough
and
meanspirited
coach
;
and
the
''
big
game
.
''
by
the
end
,
will
the
underdog
overcome
great
odds
and
triumph
?
will
everyone
in
the
town
turn
against
the
coach
?
will
the
team
win
the
climactic
game
?
do
cat
bathe
themselves
regularly
?
the
so-called
''
hero
''
in
question
be
john
moxin
-lrb-
jame
van
der
beek
-rrb-
,
a
senior
at
west
canaan
high
school
who
play
for
the
varsity
football
team
,
but
be
really
just
hope
to
get
a
scholarship
at
brown
university
so
that
he
can
get
out
of
the
dead-end
town
.
at
least
he
be
get
the
right
idea
,
since
west
canaan
,
texa
be
portray
in
the
film
as
,
frankly
,
pathetic
,
with
the
whole
town
treat
the
weekly
football
game
as
the
second
come
.
heck
,
in
one
scene
,
the
front
page
of
the
town
's
newspaper
be
proclaim
about
the
west
canaan
badger
'
big
win
the
night
before
.
when
the
team
's
star
quarterback
be
severely
injure
,
tear
the
ligament
in
he
leg
,
john
find
himself
take
over
as
the
team
's
leader
,
but
he
few
minute
of
glory
do
not
last
long
,
as
he
begin
to
have
problem
with
he
girlfriend
-lrb-
amy
smart
-rrb-
when
she
discover
he
spend
a
evening
with
another
girl
-lrb-
alus
larter
-rrb-
.
and
after
stay
out
all
night
with
he
drinking
buddy
at
a
strip
joint
-lrb-
all
of
the
teenager
in
the
film
be
portray
as
rage
alcoholic
-rrb-
,
the
team
lose
they
second-to-last
game
,
put
john
at
feud
with
the
coach
-lrb-
jon
voight
who
,
like
gary
oldman
,
be
overstay
he
welcome
in
the
typecasted
role
as
the
''
bad
guy
''
-rrb-
.
worse
yet
,
the
coach
be
threaten
to
ruin
john
's
scholarship
chance
if
the
badger
do
not
win
they
final
game
.
the
plot
of
''
varsity
blues
''
be
as
old
as
the
hill
,
and
contain
every
cliche
in
the
book
.
admittedly
,
i
be
never
exactly
bore
while
i
be
watch
it
,
but
i
hasten
to
add
that
i
be
rarely
ever
entertain
.
throughout
,
all
i
could
really
think
of
be
how
virtually
the
same
exact
story
have
be
film
with
a
great
deal
more
thoughtfulness
and
maturity
in
1983
's
''
all
the
right
move
.
''
one
of
the
biggest
problem
i
have
with
the
film
be
how
little
of
interest
any
of
the
character
actually
be
,
least
of
all
certainly
not
john
,
who
,
play
by
van
der
beek
-lrb-
of
tv
's
''
dawson
's
creek
''
-rrb-
,
be
pretty
much
a
bear
without
any
engaging
quality
.
while
i
probably
should
not
blame
this
on
van
der
beek
,
since
the
inauspicious
and
''
by-the-number
''
screenplay
by
w
.
peter
iliff
be
not
of
any
help
,
he
be
still
certainly
not
in
the
league
of
tom
cruise
in
''
all
the
right
move
.
''
the
story
revolve
around
john
,
meanwhile
,
be
extemely
thin
throughout
,
particularly
for
its
104-minute
run
time
,
and
it
alternate
between
uninspired
comic
relief
-lrb-
as
in
when
the
student
see
they
sex
education
teacher
work
as
a
stripper
at
the
club
-rrb-
and
heavy-handed
melodrama
.
the
romance
between
john
and
he
girlfriend
have
the
potential
to
be
a
adequate
subplot
,
but
we
also
learn
very
little
about
she
,
which
be
unfortunate
since
amy
smart
,
whom
i
do
not
think
i
have
see
before
in
past
film
,
be
probably
the
only
character
write
with
any
sort
of
intelligence
.
smart
do
not
allow
she
character
to
become
the
''
passive
girlfriend
,
''
instead
come
off
as
a
young
woman
with
she
own
idea
and
opinion
.
it
be
too
bad
the
camera
do
not
linger
on
she
long
enough
so
we
could
hear
some
of
those
thought
.
the
adult
character
probably
fare
the
worse
of
any
,
since
they
all
must
play
resident
of
a
dim-witted
town
that
care
about
nothing
but
football
.
john
's
relationship
with
he
parent
can
also
be
telegraph
far
in
advance
.
he
father
be
set
on
he
become
a
football
player
at
a
university
,
but
john
do
not
want
any
part
of
that
.
he
mother
stand
beside
she
''
big
,
strong
husband
''
and
be
a
passive
female
.
finally
,
jon
voight
play
the
stock
bully
coach
character
and
he
do
nothing
to
make
the
thankless
role
any
more
than
one-dimensional
.
save
''
varsity
blues
''
from
be
a
total
washout
be
a
few
amusing
sequence
,
include
one
set
in
the
sex
education
class
,
which
do
get
a
laugh
out
of
I
.
the
scene
of
play
football
be
well-shot
and
thankfully
do
not
overstay
they
welcome
,
as
many
sport
film
fall
victim
to
.
but
leave
the
theater
,
the
question
i
have
in
my
mind
be
why
do
this
film
need
to
be
make
?
i
seem
to
be
ask
this
question
quite
a
lot
lately
,
since
the
same
old
story
seem
to
be
crank
out
of
hollywood
.
do
we
really
need
another
high-school
sport
film
?
no
,
we
do
not
,
and
certainly
not
one
of
this
low-caliber
,
which
feel
like
a
cut-and-paste
job
of
spare
part
from
much
better
,
but
similar
,
film
.
''
varsity
blues
,
''
no
doubt
be
the
first
one
,
however
,
to
include
a
earnest
scene
in
which
one
of
the
character
be
only
wear
whip
cream
on
they
private
part
.
