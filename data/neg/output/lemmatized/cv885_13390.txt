's
kiss
a
fool
,
release
earlier
this
year
,
be
a
aptly
title
comedy
about
two
plastic
couple
house
in
a
artificial
story
.
like
a
sitcom
with
joke
so
lame
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
overlay
a
laugh
track
on
it
,
the
movie
meander
along
insulting
the
viewer
'
intelligence
in
almost
every
frame
.
the
script
by
jame
frey
and
the
director
be
fill
with
vapid
actor
who
read
meaningless
line
you
have
hear
before

the
bimbo

in
what
she

will
be
a
sure-fire
come-on
line
.
-rrb-
max
,
chicago
's
biggest
playboy
,
decide
to
get
marry
after
a
whirlwind
love
affair
with
sam

short
for
samantha

max
and
sam
possess
two
irritating
personality
,
and
they
hold
little
chemistry
for
each
other
or
the
audience

be
cut
from
the

cloth
,
so
they
can
be
argue
to
be
a

.
after
all
,
people
of
the
same
intelligence
be
naturally
draw
to
each
other
,
ditto
for
similar
look
,
so
why
should
not
the
personality-challenged
be
attract
?
the
implausible
plot
have
max
ask
he
best
friend
,
jay
-lrb-
jason
lee
-rrb-
,
to
hit
on
sam
as
a
test
.
jay
be

to
try
to
get
she
to
sleep
with
he
,
but
stop
short
of
the
actual
act

be
promiscuous
by
nature
,
worry
that
he
future
bride
may
have
the
same
need
to
sleep
around
as
he
do
.
the
idea
of
flirt
with
the
beautiful
sam
make
jay
so
sick
that
he
become
unable
to
eat
or
work
.
neither
the
script
nor
the
actor
make
this
test
believable
.
''
the
64

question
be
:
how
do
you
know
you
be
with
the
wrong
person
so
you
can
avoid
wreak
havoc
on
major
part
of
you
life
?

jay
ask
in
one
of
the
unsuccessful
attempt
at
add
some
seriousness
to
the
film

finally
,
there
be
the
film
's
attempt
at
physical
comedy
.
jay

ex-girlfriend
natasha

vanessa

-rrb-
become
infatuate
with
jay
again
once
she
think
he
be
go
out
with
someone
else
.
natasha
rip
jay
's
shirt
open
after
push
he
down
onto
the
sofa
.
as
she
throw
she
hair
on
he
bare
chest
,
she
demand
he
pull
it
.
this
be
suppose
to
be
funny
?
most

have
some
saving
grace
.
some
bit

do
especially
well

some
scene
manage
to
be
funny
even
if
the
rest

have
nothing
to
recommend
