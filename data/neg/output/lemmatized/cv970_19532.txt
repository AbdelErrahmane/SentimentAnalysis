have
they
replace
all
the
fancy
gizmo
with

they
would
have
wind
up
with
the

effect
.
what
we
see
on
the
screen
be
like
the
raw
ingredient
of
a
meal
:
all
of
the
expensive
f\/x
amount
to
nothing
.
part
of
the
charm
of
the
tv
series
be
its
sly
irreverence
which
have
go
down
the
toilet
in
the
condescending
movie
.
can
kid
really
admire
a
hero
so
goody-two-shoes
that
he
scream
''
hey
!
you
run
a
stop
sign
!
''
while
hang
off
the
back
bumper
of
a
quickly
move
vehicle
?
i
think
that
today
's
child
will
respond
better
to
somebody
dashing
,
someone
ultra-cool
.
they
-lrb-
probably
-rrb-
receive
enough
preach
from
they
parent
and
its
a
insult
to
they
intelligence
to
assume
that
they
want
to
go
to
a
action
movie
to
see
a
father
figure
kick
butt
.
in
addition
to
the
more
complex
complaint
above
,
there
be
also
the
simple
stuff
:
inspector
gadget
be
boring
,
formulaic
and
achingly
implausible
.
there
be
no
feeling
that
the
director
really
care
about
he
story
:
more
than
any
other
film
i
have
see
this
year
,
this
one
really
feel
like
it
be
make
on
a
assembly
line
.
there
be
a
popular
commercial
-lrb-
for
sprite
,
but
that
be
irrelevant
-rrb-
run
in
movie
theater
before
feature
that
spoof
the
way
major
studio
deal
with
project
.
it
consist
of
studio
suit
discuss
a
fictitious
-lrb-
thank
god
-rrb-
movie
call
''
death

''
.

gleefully
present
a
different
merchandise
tie-in
-lrb-

slug

!
-rrb-
.
at
the
end
one
of
they
ask
''
what
about
the
movie
?
''
another
answer
:
''
well
,
we
do
not
have
a
script
yet
,
but
we
can
bang
one
out
by
Friday
.
''
they
probably
could
have
replace
''
death
slug
''
with
inspector
gadget
.
this
film
contain
the
sort
of
logical
contradiction
and
blatantly
obvious
adherence
to
formulum
that
could
have
be
eliminate
have
any
attention
be
pay
to
the
script
.
it
be
no
coincidence
that
most
good
child
's
entertainment
these
day
come
from
animation
.
animated
feature
take
so
long
to
maker
that
it
become
a
labor
of
love
for
the
filmmaker
and
they
put
care
and
pride
into
they
work
.
these
kind
of
film
be
bang
out
quicker
and
a
good
percentage
turn
out
worthless
,
sloppy
and
impersonal
.
the
studio
be
become
factory
and

they
