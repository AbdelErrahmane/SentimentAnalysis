before
i
pile
on
with
the
many
negative
in
this
sorry
affair
,
i
'll
give
it
a
chance
with
the
positive
.
there
be
a
nice
credit
sequence
,
the
production
design
by
bo
welch
be
please
to
the
eye
,
and
the
special
effect
be
decent
enough
.
there
be
also
a
pleasant
soundtrack
.
bury

or
two
amusing
joke
.
and
salma
hayek
pop
up
as
the
female
interest
,
which
be
always
nice
to
see
.
apart
from
these
factor
,
though
,
nothing
else
in
wild
wild
west
work
.
firstly
,
there
be
little
chemistry
between
smith
and
kline
,
who
appear
to
be
in
it
purely
for
the
money
.
one
would
expect
zinger
pass
between
the
two
:
none
arise
.
both
of
they
plod
through
the
below
standard
plot
,
know
that
there
be
a
pay
cheque
wait
at
the
end
.
not
even
kenneth
branagh
provide
much
entertainment
:
although
he
be
over
the
top
,
the
material
do
not
present
much
opportunity
for
branagh
to
be
truly
crazy
.
therefore
,
he
just
come
across
as
loud
as
obnoxious
.
the
only
enjoyable
performance
come
from
the
sexy
salma
hayek
,
who
be
give
so
little
screen
time
it
be
embarrassing
.
she
appear
to
be
in
the
film
to
merely
show
off
she
body
,
and
be
ogle
at
by
kline
and
smith
.
she
character
also
change
at
a
whim
to
fit
the
mechanic
of
the
script
,
and
there
be
no
sense
of
realism
about
the
character
.
the
`
humor
'
in
the
film
be
also
very
off
.
will
smith
put
a
little
spin
to
he
daft
line
in
man
in
black
,
here
,
not
even
smith
could
save
the
humor
on
display
.
the
script
largely
boil
down
to
insult
that
be
not
very
funny
,
and
one-liner
that
barely
raise
a
smirk
.
it
be
also
somewhat
racist
,
although
it
do
not
intend
to
be
,
with
one
scene
with
jim
west
try
to
wisecrack
he
way
out
of
a
lynching
,
and
actually
say
slavery
be
good
to
save
himself
.
it
be
not
a
funny
scene
,
and
the
whole
thing
come
off
rather
uncomfortably
.
the
film
also
make
the
tragic
mistake
that
a
man
-lrb-
in
this
case
kline
-rrb-
in
a
dress
be
automatically
unfunny
,
it
be
not
,
but
the
wild
wild
west
make
this
joke
even
more
painful
to
watch
through
pure
ineptness
.
there
be
also
problem
with
the
plot
.
jim
west
and
artemus
gordon
get
catch
up
in
all
kind
of
sticky
situation
,
but
the
way
they
get
out
of
they
be
always
unsatisfying
,
and
rely
purely
on
luck
,
rather
than
audience
pleasing
skill
.
plot
element
be
introduce
into
the
film
,
and
then
throw
away
just
as
quickly
.
the
main
piece
of
the
story
,
a
80
foot
mechanical
,
steam
drive
spider
devise
by
loveless
look
rather
impressive
,
but
there
be
no
particular
reason
why
it
should
be
build
.
why
not
loveless
build
a
great
big
tank
,
instead
of
a
ungainly
,
fragile
piece
of
machinery
that
be
just
beg
to
be
blow
up
?
director
barry
sonnenfeld
always
have
a
breezy
look
to
they
,
with
some
nice
camera
trick
,
but
even
this
be
miss
from
this
stilted
affair
.
wild
wild
west
could
have
benefit
from
sonnenfeld
whack
out
style
of
directing
,
but
not
much
of
it
be
evident
,
make
this
film
drag
out
even
more
.
it
be
a
sad
thing
when
_
four

-lrb-

-rrb-
screenwriter
,
a
talented
director
and
a
willing
star
can
not
make
a

,
and
eventually

collapse
under
it
be
sexist
,
mildly
racist
,
unfunny
weight
.
