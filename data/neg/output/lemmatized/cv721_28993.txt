from
this
latest
''
interpretation
''
of
pierre
boulle
's
classic
novel
planet
of
the
ape
.
i
mean
,
how
could
you
top
the
force
and
impact
of
the
original
film
,
intelligently
co-script
by
rod
serling
-lrb-
of
twilight

best
role
of

while
rick

work
be
amazing
,
the

be
a
pathetic
hodgepodge
-lrb-

of

-rrb-
,
the
acting
be
horrible
,
and
the
''
surprise
''
end
feel
like
a
swing
from
a
ball-peen
hammer
into
the
temple
.
wahlberg
do
not
have
the
physical
or
mental
presence
of
a
chuck
heston
to
carry
the
film
or
any
of
its
action
sequence
.
this
remake
,
or
re-interpretation
,
as
tim
burton
have
proclaim
it
,
be
a
insult
to
the
intelligence
and
wit
of
the
original
film
.
the
ethical
argument
about
the
equality
of
species
,
fascism
,
and
military
buildup
have
be
replace
by
tremendous
amount
of
ridiculous
dialogue
,
a
unimaginative
narrative
structure
,
and
a
romance
between
a
monkey
and
a
human
.
even
chuck
heston
's
anti-gun
tirade
-lrb-
in
the
de
rigeur
cameo
-rrb-
seem
shallow
and
jokey
.
but
the
main
element
miss
from
this
tim
burton
film
be
tim
burton
.
even
though
he
name
be
plaster
across
every
billboard
in
america
,
john
badham
could
have
direct
this
film
.
even
joel
schumacher
could
have
direct
this
film
.
he
probably
should
have
.
burton
's
predominant
theme
of
rejection
,
isolation
,
and
the
search
for
one
's
place
in
the
universe
,
as
see
in
ed
wood
,
edward
scissorshand
,
and
pee-wee
's
big
adventure
,
be
completely
absent
in
this
planet
.
i
suppose
that
be
what
happen
when
a
great
director
get
suck
through
a
wormhole
.
