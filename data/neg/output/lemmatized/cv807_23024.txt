and
i
think
''
stigma
''
would
be
the
worst
religiously-oriented
thriller
release
this
year
.
turn
out
i
be
wrong
,
because
while
''
stigma
''
be
merely
boring
and
self-important
,
''
end
of
day
''
be
completely
inept
on
all
front
.
it
be
a
silly
,
incomprehensible
,
endlessly
stupid
mess
.
for
a
guy
like
I
who
grow
up
watch
arnold
schwarzenegger
at
he
best
,
it
be
extremely
disconcerting
to
see
where
the
big
man
have
end
up
.
for
the
first
time
in
recent
memory
,
a
arnold
action
movie
-lrb-
and
''

''
do
not

-rrb-
be
no
fun
at
all
.
''

be
a
major
stinker
.
the

open
in

some
catholic

a
ancient

the

protection
of
this

,
though
some
priest
believe
she
ought
to
be
kill
.
in
new
york
,
that
very
night
,
a
girl
be
bear
to
fulfill
the
prophecy
.
twenty
year
later
,
we
meet
jericho
cane
-lrb-
schwarzenegger
-rrb-
,
a
suicidal
ex-cop
with
a
drinking
problem
.
now

after
,

robin

recognize

include
ownership
of
the

,
apparently
-rrb-
,
jericho

to
protect
she
against
the

and
the
faction
of
priest
look
to
kill
she
.
there
be
so
many
problem
with
this
film
it
be
hard
to
know
where
to
begin
,
but
how
about
start
with
the
concept
?
cast
arnold
in
a
role
like
this
be
a
mistake
to
begin
with
.
schwarzenegger
be
a
persona
,
not
a
actor
,
so
put
he
in
a
role
that
contradict
he
usual
strong
personality
be
a
bad
idea
.
arnold
have
neither
the
dramatic
range
nor
the
speaking
ability
to
pull
off
a
character
torment
by
conflict
emotion
.
in
other
word
,
try
to
give
he
dimension
be
a
mistake
.
harrison
ford
,
mel
gibson
,
or
even
bruce
willi
could
have
play
this
role
-lrb-
they
have
all
play
noble
and
flawed
hero
-rrb-
,
but
not
schwarzenegger
.
there
be
several
scene
that
attempt
to
establish
jericho
's
character
;
one
have
he
contemplate
suicide
,
another
cry
over
the
loss
of
he
wife
and
daughter
,
and
even
one
in
which
the
devil
try
to
tempt
he
into
reveal
christine
's
location
by
offer
he
he
old
life
back
.
none
of
these
scene
really
work
,
because
arnie
be
not
up
to
the
task
.
the
filmmaker
would
have
be
better
off
make
jericho
a
strong
,
confident
character
-lrb-
like
the
terminator
,
for
example
-rrb-
,
the
likes
of
which
schwarzenegger
have
excel
in
before
.
this
one
be
not
at
all
believable
the
way
arnold
play
he
.
the
support
cast
try
they
hardest
,
and
only
gabriel
byrne
make
any
impact
at
all
.
as
the
prince
of
darkness
,
he
be
suave
and
confident
.
he
act
like
one
would
expect
the
devil
to
act
.
the
problem
be
that
the
script
have
he
do
thing
that
make
no
sense
-lrb-
more
on
that
later
-rrb-
and
that
undermine
he
as
a
powerful
villain
.
byrne
out-perform
arnold
in
every
scene
they
have
together
-lrb-
include
the
aforementioned
temptation
bit
-rrb-
,
but
this
be
problematic
when
it
cause
the
audience
to
start
do
the
unthinkable
:
root
for
the
devil
.
byrne
's
speech
about
the
bible
be
''
overrate
''
actually
start
to
make
sense
,
mainly
because
arnold
's
attempt
at
refute
it
-lrb-
mostly
of
the
''
`
tis
not
!
''
variety
-rrb-
be
feeble
at
best
.
the
only
problem
be
,
arnold
have
to
win
,
so
in
the
end
,
nobody
really
care
.
kevin
pollack
play
jericho
's
security
guard
sidekick
and
try
to
liven
thing
up
with
some
comic
aside
,
but
like
most
bad
action
movie
sidekick
,
he
disappear
after
about
a
hour
.
robin
tunney
be
not
give
much
to
do
except
look
scare
.
in
fact
,
all
of
the
support
player
be
good
actor
,
but
none
,
save
for
byrne
,
be
give
anything
interesting
to
do
.
performance
aside
,
it
would
be
really
hard
to
enjoy
this
film
no
matter
who
star
in
it
.
this
be
a
action
blockbuster
,
it
be
no
surprise
that
the
worst
thing
about
it
be
the
script
,
which
start
off
totally
confuse
,
and
when
some
of
it
be
explain
-lrb-
and
not
much
of
it
be
-rrb-
,
it
be
utterly
ridiculous
.
why
be
the
devil
come
on
new
year
's
eve
,
1999
?
because
it
be
exactly
1000
year
after
the
year
of
the
devil
,
which
be
not
666
,
it
turn
out
.
some
nutty
priest
accidentally
read
it
upside
down
,
so
the
real
year
be
999
,
so
just
add
a
1
to
the
beginning
,
and
you
have
get
1999
!
if
you
do
not
buy
this
explanation
,
you
be
not
alone
.
it
be
convoluted
and
silly
at
the
same
time
.
the
method
by
which
jericho
locate
christine
york
be
equally
ludicrous
-lrb-
she
be
christine
,
see
,
and
she
live
in
new
york
,
see
.
.
.
-rrb-
,
and
if
that
be
not
bad
enough
,
there
be
plenty
of
bothersome
stuff
in
this
film
that
be
not
explain
at
all
.
why
can
satan
kill
everyone
he
pass
on
the
street
,
but
when
it
come
to
snuff
out
one
drunk
ex-cop
,
he
be
powerless
?
be
he
impervious
to
only
one
kind
of
bullet
?
how
come
he
can
not
control
jericho
or
christine
?
and
how
do
those
gregorian
monk
deal
with
time
zone
in
they
prophecy
?
a
clumsy
attempt
at
a
joke
be
make
about
this
,
but
it
be
never
actually
explain
.
usually
,
this
sort
of
thing
would
not
matter
in
a
schwarzenegger
flick
-lrb-
i
mean
,
do
not
get
I
start
on
the
time
paradox
offer
up
by
the
terminator
movie
-rrb-
,
but
this
time
the
plot
inconsistency
stand
out
even
more
than
usual
because
the
action
be
rarely
exciting
.
there
be
several
predictable
horror
film
clich
?
s
present
in
''
end
of
day
,
''
complete
with
the
old
''
black
cat
hiding
in
a
cabinet
''
bit
,
not
that
we
ever
find
out
what
the
cat
be
do
in
there
.
it
get
so
formulaic
that
it
be
possible
for
those
uninterested
in
be
scare
to
close
they
eye
at
the
precise
moment
a
''
boo
''
will
come
.
they
prediction
will
rarely
be
wrong
.
the
more
grandiose
action
sequence
be
utterly
charmless
,
partially
because
we
do
not
care
about
these
character
-lrb-
due
to
the
script
's
pathetic
attempt
at
characterization
and
setup
-rrb-
,
and
also
because
they
,
too
,
do
not
make
any
sense
.
there
be
a
scene
where
schwarzenegger
get
throw
around
a
room
by
a
little
old
lady
.
it
be
good
for
a
few
chuckle
,
but
not
much
else
.
supposedly
we
be
to
believe
she
now
have
super
strength
by
virtue
of
be
control
by
satan
,
but
the
script
never
set
that
up
,
so
the
scene
be
merely
silly
.
none
of
this
be
terribly
exciting
,
because
all
the
action
sequence
be
so
badly
frame
that
it
be
often
hard
to
tell
why
it
be
happen
in
the
first
place
,
not
to
mention
that
they
be
edit
in
full-on
incomprehensible
mtv
quick-cut
style
.
most
of
they
have
I
scratch
my
head
,
rather
than
say
,
''
wow
,
cool
!
''
''
end
of
day
''
be
not
only
silly
and
confusing
,
but
it
be
also
distinctly
unpleasant
to
watch
.
the
devil
apparently
do
not
operate
in
the
more
subtle
,
i
'll
-
convince-people-to-kill-each-other
fashion
outline
in
the
bible
,
but
instead
enjoy
kill
people
gruesomely
in
broad
daylight
.
this
do
not
only
make
he
a
awfully
predictable
sort
,
but
it
also
mean
that
not
a
single
scene
in
''
end
of
day
''
go
by
without
unnecessarily
graphic
violence
,
or
the
odd
kinky
sexual
encounter
-lrb-
yet
another
bit
that
have
I
scratch
my
head
-rrb-
.
if
violence
be
suppose
to
be
shocking
,
it
be
not
a
good
idea
to
throw
so
much
of
it
into
a
movie
that
the
audience
go
numb
.
scene
be
not
connect
through
any
reasonable
means
,
so
a
lot
of
the
time
,
stuff
get
blow
up
,
or
people
get
kill
,
and
i
have
no
idea
why
.
reason
?
to
hell
with
reason
!
let
's
just
blow
stuff
up
!
be
not
it
cool
?
nope
,
not
by
a
long
shot
.
this
film
be
thoroughly
unwatchable
.
it
be
dull
,
interminable
,
and
unrelent
in
its
stupidity
.
perhaps
arnold
need
to
make
some
movie
with
jame
cameron
to
revive
he
career
,
because
it
be
not
happen
with
hack
peter
hyam
here
.
''
end
of
day
''
might
have
have
camp
value
,
if
only
it
do
not
top
itself
off
with
a
overly
pious
end
that
nobody
's
go
to
buy
.
if
the
movie
be
go
to
be
serious
,
the
filmmaker
should
have
come
up
with
a
decent
script
.
if
it
be
go
to
be
campy
,
arnold
should
not
be
take
himself
so
damn
seriously
-lrb-
i
do
not
actually
see
he
put
up
on
a
cross
,
do
i
?
-rrb-
,
and
he
character
should
not
be
such
a
sad
sack
.
as
it
stand
,
''
end
of
day
''
be
just
a
bad
movie
,
and
a
awfully
gloomy
one
at
that
.
