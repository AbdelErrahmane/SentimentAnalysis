although
a

require

the

the

be
leaden

the
film
take
itself
all
too
seriously
.
at
best
,
it
be
a
1940s-style
b
movie
.
a
little
humor
would
have
help
the
script
some
,
but
a
complete
rewrite
would
have
be
better
.
and
,
although
i
hate
to
say
it
,
a
different
director
would
have
be
the
biggest
improvement
