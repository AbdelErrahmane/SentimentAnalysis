i
be
continually
amaze
at
movie
like
this
.
that
some
producer
would
waste
a
abundance
of
talent
and
money
on
a
script
as
abysmal
as
this
one
be
mind-boggeling
,
but
it
seem
to
happen
a
lot
nowadays
.
''
wild
wild
west
''
be
a
beautifully
film
,
well
act
,
and
well
direct
piece
of
garbage
;
and
its
insipid
screenplay
be
completely
at
fault
.
in
short
,
this
movie
be
a
comedy
without
laugh
.
so
many
joke
fall
flat
that
it
borderline
surreal
.
the
high
production
value
keep
it
from
be
a
total
fiasco
,
but
it
be
still
pretty
boring
.
will
smith
star
as
jim
west
,
a
old
western
,
r
&
b
variation
of
the
jame
bond
character
.
west
be
team
up
with
artemus
gordon
-lrb-
kevin
kline
-rrb-
,
and
they
be
pretty
much
polar
oppisite
:
west
prefer
to
solve
he
problem
with
a
array
of
bullet
,
gordon
traditionally
favor
a
more
pacifistic
approach
.
talk
about
deeply
develop
character
.
at
any
rate
,
this
lead
to
the
inevitable
conflict
between
methodology
,
none
of
which
be
funny
.
the
year
be
1869
.
several
top
scientist
have
be
abducted
,
and
the
suspect
culprit
be
a
disgruntled
former
confederate
general
,
bloodbath
mcgrath
-lrb-
ted
levine
-rrb-
.
president
grant
send
west
and
gordon
to
investigate
.
there
be
evidence
that
mcgrath
be
attend
some
sort
of
confederate
reunion
in
louisiana
.
west
and
gordon
show
up
and
learn
that
mcgrath
be
actually
work
for
dr
.
arliss
loveless
-lrb-
kenneth
branagh
-rrb-
,
another
disgruntled
former
confederate
.
as
it
turn
out
,
loveless
plan
to
use
the
combined
knowledge
of
the
scientest
to
create
the
ultimate
super
weapon
,
which
he
will
use
to
conquer
the
united
state
.
i
would
go
further
with
the
plot
,
but
there
be
not
any
point
.
this
film
's
narrative
be
little
more
than
a
jumbled
,
unfunny
mess
.
i
only
laugh
at
a
couple
of
joke
,
and
then
only
lightly
.
there
be
not
one
truly
uprorously
funny
moment
in
this
film
,
and
that
be
pretty
disasterous
when
you
consider
that
it
be
primarily
a
comedy
.
as
i
say
,
the
fault
be
totally
that
of
the
script
.
when
you
consider
they
respective
role
,
will
smith
and
kevil
kline
do
as
good
as
they
could
have
possibly
do
.
the
lead
could
have
be
play
samuel
l
.
jackson
and
robert
de
niro
and
the
film
still
would
have
be
awful
.
no
one
,
and
i
mean
no
one
,
can
make
a
line
like
''
bye
bye
,
mr
.
knife
guy
!
''
sound
good
.
still
,
this
film
have
a
lot
go
for
it
visually
.
the
set
design
be
fantastic
,
maybe
even
oscar
worthy
.
the
cinematogrophy
by
michael
ballhaus
-lrb-
who
be
also
behind
camera
in
martin
scorsese
's
brilliant
''
goodfella
''
-rrb-
,
be
absolutely
stunning
.
he
lend
the
film
a
much
need
exciting
,
comic
bookish
look
.
i
will
not
fault
barry
sonnenfeld
either
.
he
do
a
fine
job
of
direct
the
proceedings
,
but
,
like
the
rest
of
the
people
involve
with
the
film
,
there
really
be
not
anything
that
he
can
do
to
correct
its
one
major
flaw
.
despite
be
beautifully
make
,
''
wild
wild
west
''
become
quite
boring
after
the
half-way
point
.
the
appeal
of
the
visual
end
long
before
the
film
do
.
if
''
wild
wild
west
''
do
not
look
so
good
,
it
would
be
almost
insufferable
.
as
it
be
,
it
be
somewhat
tolerable
,
but
not
very
entertaining
.
it
hurt
to
give
such
a
well
make
movie
a
score
this
low
,
but
there
be
not
anything
much
worse
than
a
unfunny
comedy
.
