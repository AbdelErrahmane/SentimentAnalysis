the
most
interesting
part
of
''
can
not
hardly
wait
''
just
happen
to
be
not
only
the
most
human
,
but
for
many
of
we
,
the
one
part
that
many
of
we
can
easily
relate
to
.
that
be
the
character
of
denise
-lrb-
lauren
ambrose
-rrb-
,
the
film
's
sole
sarcastic
member
who
mock
everything
that
go
on
in
the
film
,
and
at
one
point
sit
down
on
a
couch
and
look
totally
bore
.
the
film
wisely
hold
over
this
moment
,
nicely
show
she
alienation
in
the
midst
of
a
large
high
school
party
...
almost
too
nicely
.
for
some
member
of
the
audience
-lrb-
read
:
I
-rrb-
,
this
be
basically
a
mirror
of
what
be
go
on
with
they
watch
this
film
.
we
sit
there
wonder
why
we
have
even
bother
to
see
a
film
about
a
long
high
school
party
we
probably
never
feel
the
desire
to
go
to
in
the
first
place
.
i
would
actually
highly
recommend
this
film
if
it
satirize
all
of
this
.
after
all
,
this
film
be
fill
with
a
bunch
of
pathetic
stereotype
much
of
which
i
go
to
high
school
with
.
everyone
's
here
:
the
jock
,
the
homecoming
queen
,
the
nerd
-lrb-
and
he
dominion
of
trekky
and
x-phile
-rrb-
,
the
alienate
wannabe
writer
,
the
school
spirit
girl
,
the
pothead
-lrb-
s
-rrb-
,
the
wigger
,
etc
,
etc
,
etc
,
and
weirdly
enough
this
film
show
they
as
superficial
,
lame
,
and
basically
as
a
bunch
of
loser
.
except
for
denise
,
who
roll
she
eye
at
everything
,
and
easily
become
the
most
likable
character
even
before
she
speak
-lrb-
she
yearbook
entry
,
something
which
be
do
for
each
main
character
,
quote
oscar
wilde
-
definite
pointer
there
-rrb-
.
unfortunately
,
the
writer
and
director
take
several
major
mistep
on
the
way
to
make
this
into
a
admirable
and
even
likable
film
.
the
film
,
as
i
say
,
portray
most
of
its
character
as
superficial
and
just
totally
ignorant
to
everything
.
however
,
instead
of
stick
with
this
,
perhaps
even
go
a
bit
further
with
it
,
they
let
this
lie
,
and
actually
make
these
character
into
we
hero
.
we
follow
several
of
they
,
all
a
bunch
of
moronic
stereotype
with
only
a
shread
of
humanity
and
realism
,
and
try
to
tell
boring
and
overly
melodramatic
tale
about
they
as
if
we
actually
care
and\/or
identify
with
they
.
and
if
we
do
,
we
certainly
do
not
want
to
revisit
that
state
of
be
.
here
be
a
quick
low-down
:
it
be
graduation
,
and
we
follow
a
bunch
of
senior
on
the
last
night
,
otherwise
know
as
the
''
american
grafittus
''
or
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
the
''
daze
and
confuse
''
cliche
.
the
formal
just
follow
they
as
they
drive
aimlessly
;
the
latter
do
a
little
bit
of
that
and
feature
a
big
outdoor
keg
party
.
''
can
not
hardly
wait
''
just
opt
for
a
big
indoor
keg
party
,
and
a
little
bit
of
aimless
driving
,
albeit
of
the
i
be
-
whining-because-i-can
`
t-get-a-girl-i-want
brand
.
we
follow
many
people
around
,
but
mostly
we
trail
preston
-lrb-
ethan
embry
,
of
''
that
thing
you
do
!
''
-rrb-
,
the
alienate
writer
,
who
be
be
pine
over
the
homcoming
queen
,
amanda
-lrb-
the
totally
overrated
jennifer
love
hewitt
-rrb-
,
for
the
entirety
of
high
school
because
he
think
they
share
a
moment
they
freshman
year
over
a
freak
pop
tart
.
now
that
she
be
break
up
with
she
football
player
boyfriend
,
mike
-lrb-
peter
facinellus
-rrb-
,
he
decide
to
go
to
the
party
with
a
note
he
be
write
declare
he
''
love
''
for
she
in
the
hope
he
'll
build
up
the
gut
to
give
it
to
she
...
even
though
he
be
leave
for
a
multi-week
intensive
write
program
host
by
none
other
than
kurt
vonnegut
-lrb-
okay
:
the
ingenius
vonnegut
or
some
icky
noxema
spokesperson
?
-rrb-
.
since
that
plot
be
incredibly
lame
and
a
track
record
of
what
go
on
with
it
would
not
be
able
to
carry
a
commercial
let
alone
a
feature
film
,
and
because
it
be
a
party
,
there
be
some
more
main
character
,
such
as
:
william
-lrb-
charlie
korsmo
,
finally
surface
after
''
dick
tracy
''
-rrb-
,
the
nerd
-lrb-
and
he
dominion
-rrb-
who
have
come
up
with
a
ridiculous
plan
to
publically
sabotage
mike
,
who
be
humiliate
he
for
year
,
but
get
too
catch
up
in
drinking
to
do
it
;
kenny
-lrb-
seth
green
-rrb-
,
the
wigger
,
who
have
decide
that
this
party
will
be
where
he
will
finally
get
lay
-lrb-
uh
huh
-rrb-
;
and
denise
,
the
only
exceptional
character
,
who
unfortunately
get
stick
in
a
bathroom
-lrb-
do
not
ask
-rrb-
with
kenny
where
the
two
character
let
down
they
character
and
be
allow
to
follow
the
law
of
plot
cliche
from
point
a
to
point
b
with
nary
a
bit
of
characterization
involve
after
awhile
.
ugh
.
the
main
comparison
this
film
be
get
to
another
film
be
actually
not
''
american
grafittus
''
or
''
daze
and
confuse
,
''
two
film
that
embrace
and
ultimately
make
human
out
of
many
of
its
high
schooler
-lrb-
not
to
mention
be
extremely
entertaining
-rrb-
,
but
to
john
hughes
film
of
the
80s
,
most
notably
''
sixteen
candle
.
''
the
big
difference
in
the
two
be
that
that
film
manage
to
not
only
embrace
but
even
satirize
its
main
character
,
and
do
so
equally
and
in
a
entertaining
fashion
.
this
film
forget
to
satirize
its
character
,
and
ultimately
tell
a
story
about
a
bunch
of
uninteresting
stereotype
...
and
then
say
that
it
be
all
okay
.
we
can
not
take
this
film
seriously
,
nor
can
we
take
this
as
fun
,
so
really
what
good
be
it
?
but
i
will
tell
you
some
thing
i
do
like
:
i
like
the
direction
,
except
for
a
couple
too-over-the-top
feature
,
like
way-too-glossy
jump
cut
-lrb-
it
be
like
a
oxymoron
-rrb-
and
other
obscurity
.
generally
,
though
,
elfont
and
kaplan
do
have
graceful
camera
movement
,
and
even
manage
to
capture
a
altman-esque
feel
to
they
film
from
time
to
time
-lrb-
a
thing
with
a
note
,
though
,
be
too
hokey
to
really
be
admirable
-rrb-
.
i
actually
do
like
seth
green
,
for
once
in
about
a
decade
-lrb-
when
he
play
a
very
young
woody
allen
in
''
radio
day
''
-rrb-
-
he
desintegration
of
he
wigger
character
be
almost
believable
...
almost
.
and
,
of
course
,
lauren
ambrose
be
wonderful
as
denise
,
the
one
character
we
could
have
use
some
more
of
,
even
though
it
would
have
change
the
entirety
of
the
film
.
however
,
the
character
of
denise
really
do
not
work
with
the
film
,
when
really
think
about
.
she
be
far
too
witty
and
realize
-lrb-
at
least
for
the
first
half
-rrb-
to
belong
in
this
film
,
and
whenever
she
appear
,
she
automatically
give
everything
a
delightfully
satirical
tone
.
she
be
not
just
the
cynic
or
the
intellectual
;
she
be
just
a
very
interesting
character
who
provide
entertainment
even
if
it
further
damage
other
already
damage
character
.
she
may
ruin
the
film
more
,
but
at
least
when
she
be
on
screen
we
can
sit
up
and
think
to
ourselves
''
well
,
at
least
we
'll
be
entertain
.
''
a
couple
other
thing
that
just
do
not
work
:
mike
's
character
,
who
suffer
a
epiphany
throughout
the
film
but
in
the
end
act
as
though
he
have
forget
everything
:
too
much
the
sacrificial
lamb
for
the
film
in
general
;
the
aimless
,
bitchy
driving
by
preston
to
try
and
get
over
he
inability
to
shack
up
with
amanda
-
give
I
a
break
;
and
perhaps
the
one
thing
that
just
do
not
work
at
all
:
jenna
eflman
's
uncredited
cameo
as
a
angel
-
just
do
not
work
,
but
nice
try
.
basically
the
worst
thing
about
this
film
,
the
real
reason
i
be
give
this
such
a
low
rating
,
be
because
it
refuse
to
give
we
any
fully
realize
character
and
then
insist
we
follow
around
complete
stereotype
from
other
movie
do
thing
that
be
inane
and
unlike
anything
we
would
do
.
we
do
not
feel
for
these
character
because
for
most
of
we
,
we
be
not
stereotype
go
through
the
motion
to
worn
subplot
.
the
acid
test
for
high
school
movie
be
:
do
it
at
all
capture
the
feel
of
what
it
be
portray
?
the
answer
for
this
film
be
no
.
nice
try
,
though
.
