''
return
to
horror
high
,
''
want
to
be
a
couple
different
type
of
movie
at
once
.
the
film
tell
the
story
of
a
low-budget
horror
movie
be
film
at
the
closed-down
crippen
high
,
a
school
where
a
group
of
serial
murder
take
place
five
year
before
.
but
what
the
cast
and
crew
do
not
know
be
that
a
real
killer
,
maybe
the
same
one
that
be
never
apprehend
,
be
go
into
action
again
.
on
one
level
,
''
return
to
horror
high
''
be
a
slasher
movie
,
and
it
be
at
this
level
that
it
work
the
best
on
.
watch
the
film
,
which
be
make
in
1987
,
i
could
not
help
but
take
notice
that
the
killer
's
costume
be
almost
identital
to
that
of
the
ghostface
in
,
''
scream
,
''
and
''
scream
2
.
''
on
another
level
,
the
film
want
to
be
a
slapstick
comedy
,
and
there
be
many
hint
of
this
throughout
.
unfortunately
,
most
of
these
joke
fall
flat
.
and
the
last
thing
the
film
want
to
be
be
a
''
behind-the-scenes
''
look
at
a
exploitation
film
be
make
.
the
only
problem
be
that
,
while
much
of
it
be
suppose
to
be
from
the
movie
itself
be
make
,
no
camera
be
show
film
it
,
thus
make
it
far
more
confusing
than
it
have
to
be
.
and
to
top
it
all
off
,
the
''
twist
''
end
make
very
little
to
no
sense
whatsoever
,
and
so
we
be
basically
leave
with
feeling
as
if
we
waste
we
time
.
there
be
story
development
that
be
beyond
ludicrous
,
and
plot
hole
you
could
drive
a
winnebago
through
.
if
you
see
the
film
,
or
have
see
it
,
you
'll
know
what
i
mean
.
the
premise
of
''
return
to
horror
high
,
''
be
admittedly
pretty
crafty
,
and
i
like
the
atmosphere
of
the
school
,
which
be
where
the
whole
thing
take
place
.
but
director
froehlich
,
judge
from
this
movie
,
be
a
incompetent
director
,
except
for
be
able
to
film
the
seldom
suspeneful
scene
.
well
,
come
to
think
of
it
,
there
be
only
one
scene
that
be
actually
scary
,
and
it
have
to
do
with
two
actor
be
lock
in
a
room
as
the
killer
try
to
break
in
.
but
other
than
that
two-minute
distraction
,
''
return
to
horror
high
,
''
be
certainly
no
great
shake
.
note
:
look
for
george
clooney
in
a
support
role
as
one
of
the
actor
on
the
film
.
and
strangely
enough
,
he
be
the
first
character
to
get
the
ax
...
literally
.
