if
you
have
not
plunk
down
you
hard-earned
money
yet
for
''
wild
wild
west
,
''
the
latest
summer
holiday
offering
from
will
smith
,
let
I
say
right
now
that
you
money
will
be
better
spend
on
a
starbuck
's
frappacino
or
on
a
ben
&
jerry
's
sundae
.
these
treat
be
great
relief
from
the
summer
heat
.
in
contrast
,
this
film
make
I
simmer
in
disappointment
.
i
can
accept
the
fact
that
summer
movie
tend
to
put
more
weight
into
special
effect
and
that
good
story
and
flavorful
character
usually
take
a
back
seat
.
this
be
true
of
star
war
episode
i
,
but
at
least
in
that
film
,
the
story
and
the
character
be
still
in
the
back
seat
.
in
this
film
,
they
be
no
where
to
be
find
.
what
remains
be
hundred
of
male
extra
costume
as
gunslinger
and
foppish
aristocrat
,
lot
of
female
extra
who
look
like
can-can
dancer
,
and
a
clunky
,
80-foot
tall
instrument
of
destruction
that
resemble
a
mechanical
tarantula
.
two
man
be
ask
to
stop
this
threat
.
one
be
artemus
gordon
-lrb-
kevin
kline
-rrb-
,
a
inventor
who
use
he
intellect
and
array
of
disguise
to
best
he
opponent
.
among
he
creation
be
false
breast
and
the
bulletproof
vest
.
the
other
man
be
jim
west
-lrb-
will
smith
-rrb-
,
who
prefer
the
shoot-first-then-shoot-some-more
method
of
investigate
.
although
they
individual
talent
must
be
combine
to
achieve
success
,
they
interaction
with
one
another
merely
seem
like
a
second
rate
,
two-man
vaudevillian
act
.
for
example
,
there
be
a
scene
where
west
,
be
more
debonair
than
the
reserved
gordon
,
note
that
the
fake
breast
should
be
fill
with
water
rather
than
buckwheat
,
which
be
what
it
be
currently
fill
with
.
''
now
touch
my
breast
,
''
west
say
.
gordon
do
so
and
then
softly
coo
he
approval
.
i
find
myself
groan
at
this
kind
of
silliness
.
the
script
fail
to
generate
any
sense
of
drama
,
humor
,
or
fun
for
that
matter
.
i
do
enjoy
kline
's
reserved
performance
,
but
be
surprise
at
how
much
latitude
they
give
to
smith
.
could
it
be
that
will
smith
be
just
so
bankable
that
he
be
not
even
require
to
act
?
it
be
as
if
the
director
be
yell
''
will
smith
,
do
you
own
thing
...
and
action
!
''
here
be
a
example
.
in
this
scene
,
will
smith
be
about
to
be
hang
by
a
group
of
angry
white
people
.
he
must
endear
himself
to
the
crowd
to
escape
.
the
director
yell
,
''
will
smith
,
do
you
own
thing
...
and
action
!
''
in
another
scene
,
he
have
to
masquerade
as
a
belly
dancer
in
order
to
save
he
comrade
.
''
will
smith
,
do
you
own
thing
...
and
action
!
''
worse
still
,
the
final
battle
scene
aboard
the
mechanical
tarantula
be
a
horrid
mess
.
there
be
cog
spin
and
pulley
pull
and
lever
go
up
and
down
everywhere
you
look
.
there
be
actually
a
lot
of
imagination
at
work
in
this
film
.
there
be
some
genuinely
clever
invention
and
gizmo
introduce
,
but
all
of
this
imagination
be
waste
in
a
film
that
be
visually
cluttered
and
dramatically
flat
.
and
that
be
too
bad
because
if
there
be
more
focus
on
the
story
rather
than
will
smith
just
do
he
`
thing
,
'
this
film
might
have
be
palatable
.
as
it
turn
out
,
''
wild
wild
west
''
be
the
wild
,
wild
worst
and
receive
my
vote
for
biggest
disappointment
of
the
year
.
