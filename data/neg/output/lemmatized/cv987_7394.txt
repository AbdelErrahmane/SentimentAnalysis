please
do
not
mind
this
windbag
let
off
a
bit
of
steam
...
i
just
want
to
warn
all
of
y'
all
not
to
waste
you
hard-earned
$
$
$
on
anaconda
.
it
be
not
even
worth
a
99-cent
video
rental
.
do
not
listen
to
ebert
on
this
one
-lrb-
he
have
no
clue
what
he
be
talk
about
!
-rrb-
btw
i
accompany
my
friend
to
this
one
because
she
be
\*
require
\*
to
watch
it
on
assignment
-lrb-
she
review
movie
for
a
local
paper
-rrb-
.
now
i
'll
actually
back
up
my
huffing
and
puffing
.
here
go
:
movie
:
anaconda
rydain
's
bottom
line
:
wait
for
it
to
come
on
usa
up
all
night
.
even
then
,
i
doubt
it
be
worth
the
price
of
jolt
-lrb-
to
help
you
stay
up
that
late
!
-rrb-
why
do
i
hate
anaconda
?
let
I
count
the
way
...
first
of
all
,
this
movie
get
way
too
many
snake
fact
wrong
.
as
a
ophiophile
-lrb-
snake
lover
-rrb-
,
i
can
tell
you
that
a
-rrb-
anaconda
would
never
reach
a
length
of
40
foot
,
b
-rrb-
they
be
scare
of
people
,
c
-rrb-
case
of
snake
eat
adult
human
be
extremely
rare
because
human
shoulder
be
too
wide
to
fit
in
a
snake
's
mouth
,
and
constrictor
snake
do
not
kill
what
they
can
not
eat
,
d
-rrb-
people
can
outrun
snake
with
no
trouble
,
especially
heavy
one
like
anaconda
,
e
-rrb-
if
a
anaconda
do
eat
a
human
,
it
would
need
at
least
6
month
of
sit
on
its
butt
to
digest
the
huge
meal
,
therefore
it
could
not
run
around
gobble
up
everybody
else
in
the
cast
,
and
f
-rrb-
snake
have
no
vocal
cord
,
so
they
can
not
make
funny
squeal
noise
.
whew
.
i
be
prepare
to
suspend
reality
if
the
movie
would
have
be
worth
it
.
unfortunately
,
anaconda
be
about
as
suspenseful
and
exciting
as
watch
paint
peel
.
my
friend
and
i
even
successfully
predict
who
would
live
at
the
end
.
anybody
can
tell
the
bad
guy
be
go
to
die
eventually
.
that
be
a
pity
because
he
character
be
one
of
the
few
reason
my
friend
and
i
do
not
give
up
and
fall
asleep
.
he
be
the
most
likable
character
in
the
movie
.
who
would
not
enjoy
somebody
who
look
like
a
deranged
walt
whitman
?
anaconda
do
have
its
cute
moment
:
argument
between
ice
cube
's
character
and
the
british
guy
,
for
instance
.
however
,
those
small
flash
of
wit
be
not
worth
the
other
hour
and
twenty-eight
minute
of
boring
schlock
.
the
writer
have
-
and
blow
-
a
multitude
of
opportunity
to
insert
funny
line
.
i
be
quite
disappointed
with
a
scene
where
a
young
guy
tell
a
young
lady
that
the
jungle
make
he
horny
.
do
she
retort
with
a
clever
,
ego-withering
comeback
?
of
course
not
!
''
i
be
try
to
work
!
''
gee
,
that
be
even
dumber
than
the
crap
comeback
i
come
up
with
.
she
could
have
tell
he
to
go
find
a
knothole
or
something
...
;
p
but
i
will
admit
,
there
be
just
one
scene
where
i
be
surprise
at
the
outcome
-lrb-
hint
:
it
involve
the
evil
guy
and
miss
crap
comeback
-rrb-
.
as
for
the
plot
,
i
be
still
try
to
find
one
.
this
movie
be
basically
a
excuse
to
get
a
boatload
of
people
into
dangerous
territory
where
they
could
get
snarf
by
ridiculous
,
computer-generated
anaconda
with
the
eye
and
fang
of
viper
and
the
faster-than-gravity
downward
acceleration
of
a
harrier
jet
.
-lrb-
harrier
snake
?
-rrb-
not
to
mention
instant
digestion
so
they
could
go
snarf
countless
other
victim
.
the
writer
try
to
throw
in
some
sort
of
plot
twist
-lrb-
should
i
call
it
a
plot
knot
because
it
make
no
sense
?
-rrb-
in
which
the
sick
guy
's
g-friend
kiss
the
evil
dude
and
suddenly
everybody
hate
say
evil
dude
and
start
try
to
kill
he
.
that
be
about
as
clear
and
understandable
as
mission
:
impossible
.
-lrb-
if
someone
could
explain
that
movie
to
I
,
i
would
be
most
grateful
!
all
the
old-guy
double
agent
look
the
same
!
!
-rrb-
i
be
not
inspire
by
the
act
,
save
for
the
evil
dude
.
i
can
not
blame
the
actor
,
though
.
it
be
not
they
fault
they
have
a
cruddy
script
to
work
with
.
this
conclude
rydain
's
diatribe
on
a
shameless
exploitation
-lrb-
and
perpetuation
!
-rrb-
of
public
fear
of
snake
.
comment
,
flame
,
anyone
?

cheese
