the
first
species
be
a
moderately-successful
science
fiction
yarn
that
divert
audience
with
some
nifty
special
effect
,
a
few
well
-
paced
action
sequence
,
and
frequent
view
of
model-turned-actress
natasha
henstridge
san
clothing
.
however
,
it
be
definitely
not
a
movie
that
cry
out
for
a
sequel
.
and
,
consider
the
quality
of
species
2
,
it
be
obvious
that
mgm
should
have
stop
while
they
be
ahead
.
the
only
thing
that
distinguish
species
2
be
how
awful
it
be
.
if
you
throw
away
the
plot
,
which
be
characterize
by
a
blatant
disregard
for
intelligence
,
logic
,
coherence
,
and
consistency
,
species
2
actually
have
a
few
thing
to
recommend
it
to
a
select
audience
.
of
course
,
that
audience
be
primarily
comprise
of
teenage
boy
-lrb-
who
,
at
least
in
theory
,
should
not
be
able
to
get
into
a
''
r
''
-
rate
film
-rrb-
and
connoisseur
of
bad
movie
.
there
be
enough
blood
,
gore
,
simulated
sex
,
and
bare
flesh
in
species
2
to
prevent
it
from
ever
become
boring
.
this
be
a
grade
z
exploitation
flick
that
be
ripe
for
the
mystery
science
theater
3000
treatment
.
somewhere
,
someplace
,
i
recall
hearing
species
2
describe
as
''
erotic
.
''
i
would
love
to
know
who
use
with
that
adjective
for
this
movie
,
because
he
-lrb-
or
she
-rrb-
have
a
peculiar
notion
of
eroticism
.
sure
,
there
be
a
lot
of
sex
and
nudity
,
but
it
be
almost
always
accompany
by
the
rip
open
of
a
woman
's
abdomen
as
a
alien
baby
claw
its
way
free
,
splatter
blood
and
gore
in
all
direction
.
anyone
turn
on
by
that
be
not
someone
i
would
care
to
be
sit
next
to
in
a
theater
.
i
suppose
the
main
attraction
in
species
2
be
natasha
henstridge
-lrb-
and
,
to
get
the
obvious
question
out
of
the
way
--
yes
,
she
do
remove
she
top
,
but
only
once
,
and
only
briefly
-rrb-
.
although
the
character
she
play
in
the
original
species
be
dead
,
government
scientist
still
have
the
dna
,
and
,
out
of
what
can
only
be
describe
as
a
suicidal
impulse
,
they
decide
to
create
another
clone
.

by
marg
helgenberger
,
reprise
she
role
-rrb-
,
be
genetically
engineer
to
be
kinder
and
more
docile
.
meanwhile
,
man
have
finally
set
foot
on
mar
.
a
team
of
three
,
lead
by
patrick
ross
-lrb-
justin
lazard
-rrb-
,
have
travel
to
the
red
planet
,
but
when
they
return
to
earth
,
they
bring
something
with
they
.
ross
have
become
a
half-human\/half-alien
hybrid
,
and
he
be
soon
mate
like
crazy
,
collect
the
blood-soaked
child
that
be
the
result
of
each
sex
session
.
he
intention
be
obviously
world
domination
.
stand
in
he
way
be
that
indomitable
soldier
of
fortune
from
the
first
film
,
preston
lennox
-lrb-
michael
madsen
-rrb-
,
and
one
of
patrick
's
fellow
astronaut
,
denni
gamble
-lrb-
mykeltus
williamson
-rrb-
.
but
when
patrick
learn
about
eve
,
a
female
of
he
kind
,
there
be
no
damp
he
ardor
.
i
be
not
sure
what
the
budget
for
species
2
be
,
but
a
significant
portion
of
it
must
have
go
into
pay
handsome
salary
to
several
recognizable
actor
-lrb-
as
oppose
to
be
divert
into
the
special

-rrb-
.
michael
madsen
and
marg
helgenberger
,
both
back
for
a
second
round
,
be
clearly
on
hand
to
do
as
little
as
they
can
,
grab
the
money
,
and
run
.
ditto
for
jame
cromwell
,
who
play
patrick
's
father
--
''
underused
''
be
too
kind
a
word
to
describe
he
involvement
-lrb-
''
invisible
''
would
be
more
like
it
-rrb-
.
george
dzundza
get
to
do
a
little
scenery
-
chew
as
a
angry-but-inept
general
.
meanwhile
,
justin
lazard
's
performance
as
patrick
be
so
flat
that
he
make
natasha
henstridge
's
limited
ability
look
good
by
comparison
.
the
only
one
in
the
whole
production
with
any
energy
be
mykelti
williamson
,
who
be
cast
in
the
part
of
the
wisecracking
black
sidekick
.
complete
with
cheesy
special
effect
,
bare
breast
around
every
narrative
corner
,
and
dialogue
capable
of
produce
howl
of
laughter
,
species
2
have
be
dump
into
the
marketplace
without
advance
screening
for
critic
.
director
peter

,
a
journeyman
film
maker
with
a
significant
list
of
mediocre
movie
on
he
resume
,
have
add
another
forgettable
title
,
but
at
least
he
appear
to
have
have
fun
do
it
,
which
be
more
than
can
be
say
of
anyone
try
to
take
this
film
with
even
a
scintilla
of
seriousness
.
do
i
recommend
the
movie
?
absolutely
not
,
but
i
will
admit
that
species
2
be
dopey
enough
that
it
do
not
try
my
patience
to
the
degree
that
some
pseudo-intellectual
bad
movie
do
.
here
's
hope
there
be
no
species
3
.
