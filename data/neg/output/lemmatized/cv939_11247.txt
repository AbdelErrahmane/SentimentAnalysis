,
grow
suspicious
of

fidelity
.
he
convince

to
flirt
with

during
the
development
of

book
,
to
''
test
she
''
.
the
trouble
be
,
jay
might
be
secretly
in
love
with
she
.
to
stretch
this
flat
,
sitcom
premise
to
feature
length
,
the
plot
be
frame
by
a
climactic
wedding
,
at
which
bonnie
hunt
recount
the
triangular
tale
--
the
event
lead
up
to
the
nuptials
--
to
a
annoying
fat
man
and
he
silly
girlfriend
.
hunt
have
the
best
comic
timing
of
anyone
in
the
film
;
schwimmer
can
spin
bad
dialogue
into
mildly
humorous
dialogue
;
and
lee
,
poor
lee
,
be
miscast
.
so
hysterically
funny
in
chase
amy
,
here
he
be
force
to
repress
he
comic
instinct
:
to
swear
,
to
yell
,
to
talk
about
oral
sex
...
the
script
's
idea
of
a
character
trait
be
to
stress
that
jay
be
a
''
sensitive
man
''
,
and
then
show
he
drink
pepto
bismol
when
he
be
stew
over
he
girl
trouble
.
as
for
avital
,
a
israeli
actress
,
she
be
warm
and
sweet
,
but
we
do
not
know
anything
about
she
character
other
than
that
it
take
she
a
incredibly
long
time
to
realize
the
most
obvious
thing
.
she
also
too
closely
resemble
the
stunningly
beautiful
karus
wuhrer
,
who
play
schwimmer
's
assistant
and
personal
temptress
,
turn
that
particular
subplot
into
a
unintentional
riff
on
vertigo
.
there
be
a
handful
,
a
smattering
,
of
good
scene
in
kiss
a
fool
.
i
enjoy
a
moment
in
a
comedy
club
,
during
which
jay
get
up
and
ask
''
have
anyone
here
ever
hate
they
girlfriend
so
much
you
want
to
kill
she
?
''
over
and
over
until
he
be
boot
off
stage
.
there
be
also
a
few
obviously
improvise
line
that
be
fresher
than
anything
that
be
on
the
page
.
kiss
a
fool
be
never
as
clever
as
the
Thursday
night
joke-machine
friend
that
spawn
schwimmer
's
movie
career
,
so
save
yourself
eight
dollar
and
watch
three
episode
of
that
series
back
to
back
.
