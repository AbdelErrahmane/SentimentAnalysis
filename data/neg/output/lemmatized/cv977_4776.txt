four

the
biggest
director
in
hollywood
:
quentin
tarantino
,
robert
rodriguez
,
alexander
rockwell
,
and
alison
ander
be
all
direct
one
big
film
with
a
big
and
popular
cast
.
i
guess
it
be
all
just
too
much
because
this
turn
out
to
be
the
biggest
flop
of
the
year
and
it
could
of
be
great
.
the
plot
:
it
be
new
year
eve
and
it
be
a
bellboy
's
first
day
on
the
job
.
he
encounter
many
mysterious
and
kinky
hotel
guest
as
he
try
to
handle
all
he
own
problem
.
tarantino
tell
he
director
this
plot
,
and
each
of
they
write
a
script
.
it
turn
out
each
of
they
have
write
a
dark
comedy
.
ander
write
and
direct
the
tale
about
a
coven
of
witch
-lrb-
madonna
,
valerium
golino
,
alicium
witt
,
and
ione
skye
-rrb-
,
which
be
the
worst
one
out
of
all
of
they
.
the
second
room
-lrb-
jennifer
beal
-rrb-
be
better
,
but
lack
in
plot
.
this
room
be
about
a
man
who
accuse
every
man
of
sleep
with
he
wife
.
the
third
room
-lrb-
antonio
bandera
-rrb-
be
the
best
roomm
,
about
two
rambunctous
kid
that
trash
a
hotel
suite
.
the
final
one
-lrb-
tarantino
,
willi
-rrb-
be
about
a
movie
star
want
the
bellboy
to
chop
off
someone
's
finger
.
the
movie
be
just
plain
trash
.
there
be
nothing
here
that
even
make
up
a
quality
film
.
it
be
not
funny
,
and
i
do
not
hear
one
laugh
in
the
theater
throughout
the
whole
film
.
tim
roth
be
horrible
as
the
bumble
and
mumble
bellboy
,
and
he
ruin
every
joke
in
the
film
.
the
support
cast
lose
mean
to
the
word
support
and
the
only
mentionable
actors\/actresses
be
antonio
bandera
and
jennifer
beal
.
marisa
tomeus
appear
in
a
stupid
cameo
role
.
this
movie
be
the
worst
film
of
the
year
and
the
film
could
have
be
great
,
perhaps
like
a
more
upbeat
''
plaza
suite
,
''
but
it
be
not
.
as
trashy
as
it
be
,
some
people
will
call
it
classic
.
do
you
call
a
man
chop
off
a
finger
with
madonna
's
chest
show
a
classic
film
?
