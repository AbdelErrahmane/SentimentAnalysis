after
see
blaze
and
driving
miss
daisy
,
i
be
ready
for
some
mindless
fun
--
oh
,
maybe
something
like
tango
&
cash
.
maybe
not
!
mindless
fun
be
one
thing
,
but
brain-dead
slop
be
another
matter
altogether
.
tango
&
cash
have
''
lowest
common
denominator
''
write
all
over
it
.
the
movie
star
sylvester
stallone
and
kurt
russell
as
rival
undercover
cop
in
l
.
a
.
russell
play
cash
,
a
reckless
slob
who
dress
in
jeans
and
tee
shirt
.
stallone
play
tango
,
a
wealthy
investor
who
work
on
the
force
strictly
for
the
thrill
of
it
;
he
do
not
need
the
money
.
in
a
effort
to
change
he
image
,
stallone
go
for
a
yuppie
,
gq
look
in
the
film
,
wear
spectacles
and
three
piece
suit
.
the
two
detective
reluctantly
become
partner
after
they
be
frame
for
murder
and
have
to
break
out
of
prison
to
clear
they
name
.
tango
&
cash
be
unbearably
noisy
.
for
starter
,
there
be
harold
faltermeyer
's
annoy
synthesize
score
,
which
get
old
after
four
note
.
to
make
matter
worse
,
the
filmmaker
seem
to
think
that
when
it
come
to
loud
explosion
and
screech
car
,
the
more
the
merrier
.
in
fact
,
the
movie
begin
with
not
one
but
two
car
chase
.
there
be
nothing
like
a
good
old
car
chase
to
introduce
the
character
in
a
movie
.
screenwriter
randy
feldman
's
brain
must
have
go
to
mush
from
watch
too
many
cop
show
on
tv
.
he
shockingly
stupid
screenplay
undermine
anything
and
everything
the
movie
have
go
for
it
,
such
as
stallone
's
effort
to
convince
you
that
tango
be
a
intellectual
.
in
a
movie
with
the
iq
level
of
a
amoeba
,
even
a
great
actor
be
go
to
have
trouble
look
intelligent
--
and
stallone
be
no
lawrence
olivier
.
it
be
hard
to
imagine
anyone
reading
feldman
's
script
and
thinking
,
''
i
want
to
be
in
this
movie
.
''
the
film
's
plot
do
not
have
one
original
bone
in
its
body
,
and
--
again
--
you
have
to
point
you
finger
at
the
screenwriting
.
feldman
's
story
line
succumb
to
every
crime
thriller
cliche
in
the
book
,
make
tango
&
cash
altogether
generic
and
predictable
.
they
simply
could
have
call
it
''
action
movie
.
''
every
character
,
every
twist
and
turn
,
be
steal
from
television
or
from
other
movie
.
add
insult
to
injury
,
tango
&
cash
be
about
as
believable
as
a
''
road
runner
''
cartoon
.
action
movie
do
not
have
to
be
realistic
,
but
they
should
absorb
you
enough
so
that
you
be
not
think
about
the
lack
of
realism
.
the
only
artistic
aspect
of
tango
&
cash
be
the
cinematography
.
there
be
some
spectacular
shot
,
especially
during
the
rainy
nighttime
prison
break
in
which
tango
and
cash
slide
to
safety
on
electrical
wire
.
the
film
's
main
draw
be
the
chemistry
between
stallone
and
russell
.
unfortunately
,
they
relationship
rarely
progress
past
macho
competition
as
they
endlessly
bicker
about
who
pack
more
meat
in
he
pants
.
the
dialogue
consist
of
nothing
but
one-liner
,
and
consequently
the
attempt
at
character
development
be
embarrassing
.
it
be
a
shame
because
with
a
workable
screenplay
,
russell
and
stallone
could
have
turn
tango
&
cash
into
a
charming
''
lethal
weaponesque
''
adventure
.
tango
&
cash
try
to
maintain
a
light
tone
,
and
you
do
laugh
about
once
every
five
minute
.
see
russell
in
drag
be
the
movie
's
funniest
moment
,
but
you
probably
already
have
see
it
in
the
commercial
.
furthermore
,
the
light
tone
do
not
sit
well
against
the
relentlessly
brutal
violence
.
machine
gun
and
torture
generally
do
not
mix
well
with
comedy
.
jack
palance
appear
in
tango
&
cash
do
what
he
do
best
:
play
a
sleazy
,
conniving
villain
.
he
character
,
however
,
be
run-of-the-mill
,
except
for
he
strange
obsession
with
mouse
.
like
many
movie
villain
,
palance
like
to
play
game
.
in
fact
,
he
set
a
ridiculously
elaborate
trap
for
tango
and
cash
,
a
trap
which
send
the
two
detective
to
prison
so
they
can
be
beat
and
electrocute
by
some
meanie
in
the
boiler
room
.
you
have
to
wonder
why
palance
do
not
just
shoot
the
detective
in
the
head
!
the
story
would
crumble
if
any
of
the
character
be
to
do
anything
intelligent
.
terus
hatcher
play
stallone
's
sister
and
russell
's
love-interest
,
and
she
be
just
as
pretty
as
can
be
.
but
regrettably
,
hatcher
's
acting
be
not
on
par
with
she
exceptional
beauty
.
every
time
she
open
she
mouth
,
you
cringe
;
corny
dialogue
and
atrocious
act
be
always
a
fatal
combination
.
there
be
really
very
little
,
if
anything
,
to
recommend
in
the
film
.
and
,
more
to
the
point
,
tango
definitely
be
not
worth
a
penny
of
you
cash
--
so
do
not
bother
.
