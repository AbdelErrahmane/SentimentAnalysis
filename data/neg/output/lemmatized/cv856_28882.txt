burnt
money
be
the
perfect
festival
film
.
it
will
show
once
or
twice
,
and
then
no
one
,
thankfully
,
will
ever
have
to
hear
from
it
again
.
this
film
from
the
seattle
international
film
festival
2001
's
emerge
master
series
be
easily
one
of
the
year
's
worst
.
bill
as
a
gay
`
bonnie
and
clyde
'
,
this
gritty
film
from
director
marcelo
pi
?
eyro
have
its
only
highlight
in
a
well-designed
title
sequence
.
two
gay
lover
get
involve
in
a
bank
robbery
that
make
a
gang
leader
,
whose
plan
they
screw
up
,
angry
.
this
cause
the
gang
leader
to
send
he
boy
out
to
get
the
gay
guy
,
one
of
whom
may
not
actually
be
gay
.
hide
out
in
a
prostitute
's
apartment
,
the
two
man
must
fight
off
police
and
gang
member
in
a
very
long
showdown
for
the
movie
's
conclusion

,
they
risk
lose
all
the
money
,
and
they
love
.
as
a
add
emotional
bonus
,
one
of
the
gay
man
be
die
.
or
something
like
that
.
everything
that
happen
be
so
quick
and
confusing
i
be
completely
lose
.
clarity
be
not
exactly
this
movie
's
strive
virtue
,
so
it
be
a
little
hard
to
pick
up
.
not
much
could
have
really
happen
though
.
the
main
event
in
this
long
two-hour
film
be
explicit
homosexual
and
heterosexual
sex
,
graphic
drug
use
,
extreme
violence
,
and
strong
language
.
lot
of
explicit
material
be
never
a
bad
thing
when
there
be
a
reason
,
but
there
be
no
purpose
to
anything
in
this
film
.
most
of
the
sex
and
violence
scene
come
off
as
silly
,
while
the
heavy
drug
use
come
off
as
ridiculous
and
depressing
.
it
appear
pi
?
eyro
-lrb-
who
co-write
with
marcelo
figuera
,
from
a
novel
by
ricardo
piglium
-rrb-
purposefully
add
more
blood
and
lovemaking
for
he
own
amusement
.
he
make
the
actor
as
sweaty
and
dirty
as
possible
,
make
they
snort
cocaine
,
give
they
gun
and
condom
,
and
let
they
go
.
burnt
money
be
pointless
.
the
performance
be
bad
.
it
try
to
thrill
and
shock
,
but
only
cause
boredom
.
god
forbid
it
will
ever
get
a
distributor
.
another
disappointing
film
from
this
year
's
so-called
emerge
master
series
.
pass
on
by
.
