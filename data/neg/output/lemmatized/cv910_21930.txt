just
like
stupid
teens
in
any
teen
direct
film
such
as
this
one
,
the
foursome
decide
to
cover
up
the
death
to
make
it
look
like
a
murder
commit
by
someone
else
.
and
also
just
like
in
other
teen
direct
movie
,
one
of
the
four
do
not
agree
with
hide
it
,
this
time
that
character
be
julie

and
finally
,
just
like
in
other
teen
movie
,
there
be
a
witness
outside
the
group
try
to
hide
the
truth
.
this
time
that
character
be
fern
mayo
-lrb-
judy
greer
-rrb-
,
who
be
subject
to
many
crack
from
courtney
's
group
,
as
well
as
the
entire
school
.
-rrb-
from
here
,
jawbreaker
turn
into
a
predictable
tale
of
revenge
,
bad
moral
,
and
at
least
try
to
do
the
right
thing
.
not
only
be
the
script
weak
,
on
a
whole
the
acting
be
horrid
thanks
to
a
large
amount
of
the
main
cast
.
judy
greer
be
undeniably
awful
as
she
one
dimensional
,
annoying
character
,
as
she
overact
every
line
she
have
.
also
on
the
bad
side
of
act
be
julie
benz
,
almost
fall
to
the
annoying
factor
that
greer
deliver
.
on
the
positive
side
of
act
,
rise
mcgowan
perform
well
here
,
but
do
not
match
she
wickedly
clever
performance
as
''
tatum
''
,
in
1996
's
scream
.
mcgowan
's
role
be
annoying
,
but
this
only
add
to
the
film
.
she
be
wickedly
mean
,
and
even
though
she
a
well-written
character
,
you
downright
hate
she
.
fare
even
better
than
mcgowan
be
rebecca
gayheart
,
who
be
always
exceptionally
believable
as
she
role
.
when
the
script
feed
she
a
one
or
two
dimensional
character
,
she
turn
it
into
three
,
always
put
strong
emotion
and
power
into
she
role
.
gayheart
be
not
give
as
much
to
do
here
as
she
be
in
1998
's
urban
legend
,
but
you
can
still
get
a
strong
taste
of
she
acting
skill
in
jawbreaker
.
jawbreaker
drift
and
miander
different
sub
plot
throughout
,
hardly
throw
anything
for
the
viewer
to
get
absorb
in
.
we
get
way
off
of
the
topic
of
the
jawbreaker
incident
,
and
get
into
thing
that
do
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
actual
film
.
the
beginning
and
end
be
strong
,
it
be
just
the
middle
that
need
a
lot
of
help
.
during
the
body
of
the
movie
,
it
be
undeniably
repetitive
,
never
progress
towards
a
conclusion
.
nothing
to
grab
the
viewer
's
interest
be
around
,
and
the
same
,
extremely
annoying
song
play
over
and
over
again
.
jawbreaker
try
to
get
off
on
the
same
time
of
humor
use
in
the
1995
film
clueless
,
but
fall
flat
.
the
few
gag
that
actually
work
die
off
quickly
and
die
off
with
a
bang
.
all
in
all
,
a
horrible
disappointment
.
the
bottom
line
:
the
tagline
read
,
''
even
the
sweetest
candy
be
sour
as
death
inside
.
''
yes
,
that
be
too
true
.
no
matter
how
good
this
film
may
have
look
,
it
fail
to
deliver
.
