the
most
absurd
remake
of
1998
?
it
be
a
toss
up
between
gus
van
sant
's
psycho
and
mighty
joe
young
,
the
new
disney
picture
base
on
the
old
rko
picture
.
-lrb-
i
know
i
be
in
trouble
when
a
polished
,
computer-generated
version
of
that
famous
rko
logo
appear
before
the
head
credit
.
-rrb-
there
be
no
great
demand
for
another
giant
ape
movie-make
that
ape
movie
,
period
.
-lrb-
witness
the
quick
death
of
buddy
,
bear
to
be
wild
and
congo
.
-rrb-
and
while
this
latest
entry
be
inoffensive
and
watchable
,
it
be
also
a
assembly
line
product
through
and
through
,
lack
the
charm
and
unpredictability
of
the
jungle
serial
that
partly
inspire
it
.
theron
be
jill
young
:
as
a
young
girl
in
the
wild
of
africa
,
she
befriend
a
baby
gorilla
after
both
they
mother
be
slay
by
poacher
.
that
baby
gorilla
-lrb-
nickname
joe
-rrb-
grow
to
immense
proportion
,
and
adult
jill
basically
bide
she
time
look
after
he
,
play
hide
and
seek
with
he
and
guard
he
against
poacher
.
enter
conservationist
greg
-lrb-
paxton
-rrb-
,
who
convince
jill
to
move
with
joe
to
californium
,
where
they
can
protect
he
better
in
a
controlled
environment
.
joe
be
restless
at
first
;
no
sooner
do
he
finally
settle
in
to
the
new
place
than
those
nasty
poacher
show
up
in
l
.
a
.
,
plot
joe
's
demise
.
suffice
it
to
say
,
the
movie
could
have
be
call
''
joe
:
ape
in
the
city
.
''
theron
-lrb-
so
good
in
devil
's
advocate
-rrb-
and
paxton
-lrb-
so
good
in
the
recent
a
simple
plan
-rrb-
be
fine
actor
,
but
not
fine
enough
to
transcend
the
material
,
a
paint-by-numbers
script
from
the
hack
writer
of
superman
iv
and
mercury
rising
.
the
plot
arguably
borrow
more
from
steven
spielberg
's
the
lost
world
than
the
1949
original
,
with
the
computer-generated
t-rex-i
mean
,
joe-wreaking
havoc
on
the
busy
street
for
a
encore
;
the
storytelling
become
especially
lazy
during
this
final
third
,
with
jill
shouting
,
''
look
,
joe
's
head
for
the
movie
theater
!
''
follow
by
a
shot
of
joe
scaling
mann
's
chinese
theater
;
a
moment
later
,
jill
shout
again
something
like
''
look
,
joe
's
head
for
a
amusement
park
!
''
and
what
do
you
know
,
there
be
joe
at
the
pallisade
carnival
,
scare
the
bejesus
out
of
innocent
thrillseeker
.
the
seam
of
last-minute
edit
to
mighty
joe
young
show-unrelated
scene
be
patch
together
with
quick
dissolve
.
the
movie
sure
feel
uneven
,
regardless
:
act
two
be
underdeveloped
,
while
a
little
of
joe
smashing
car
in
act
three
go
a
long
,
long
way
.
underwood
-lrb-
tremor
,
speechless
-rrb-
be
perhaps
not
the
director
for
the
job
;
even
the
plentiful
,
untame
landscape
look
dull
in
he
hand
.
-lrb-
capture
the
beauty
of
nature
require
more
than
he
point
and
shoot
style
.
-rrb-
i
do
enjoy
certain
sequence
,
especially
the
demoliton
of
a
black-tie
dinner
sequence
;
and
the
prologue
,
however
implausible
,
be
touch
.
-lrb-
as
a
tyke
,
joe
act
just
like
e
.
t
.
-rrb-
rick
baker
's
make-up
effect
and
puppetry
be
outstanding
,
the
real
star
of
the
show-yet
,
for
all
its
technical
flawlessness
,
the
creature
remain
too
grumpy
and
homicidal
to
love
.
-lrb-
he
facial
expression
be
variation
on
a
scowl
.
-rrb-
to
be
fair
,
i
see
mighty
joe
young
in
a
cinema
pack
with
wail
children-it
's
a
wonder
i
be
able
to
decipher
the
dialogue
.
it
be
certainly
not
a
film
for
very
young
kids-intense
fighting
scene
may
scare
they
,
while
any
time
joe
's
not
on
camera
may
bear
they
to
tear
.
-lrb-
note
:
older
boy
be
more
likely
to
be
dazzle
by
theron
's
colorful
array
of
tank
top
.
-rrb-
i
suspect
bland
mighty
joe
young
be
passable
entertainment
for
a
family
outing
,
but
they
sure
do
not
make
?
em
like
they
use
to
.
