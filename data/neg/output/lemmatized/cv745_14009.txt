there
be
a
heavy
nostalgia
nowadays
for

nowhere
be
it
more

than

,
the

fit
the

the

probably
do
not
hurt
the
rating
either
.
after

it
be
not

that
you

that
be
about
as
much
of
a
plot
as
we
have
.
there
be
some
footage
about
a
lot
of
other
thing
that
either
do
not
make
sense
or
make
even
less
sense
.
we
get

in

there
be
probably
a
reason
for
all
of
this
,
but
we
'll
never
know
it
.
macnee
make
a
appearance
of
sort
.
he
be
the
voice
for
a
invisible
man
whose
character
go
nowhere
in
a
scene
that
do
nothing
.
a
group
of
villain
sit
around
a
table
,
all
clothe
in
huge
pastel-colored
teddy
bear
outfit
.
at
first
it
be
humorous
to
watch
the
teddy
waddle
around
,
but
then
it
become
goofy
.
the
movie
be
a
medley
of
clutter
,
confusion
and
wrong
decision
around
every
corner
.
it
feel
like
major
portion
of
the
film
be
miss
.
the
storyline
jump
rather
than
flow
.
reportedly
the
film
be
re-cut
several
time
.
this
be
one
of
those
time
where
the
whole
be
less
than
the
sum
of
the
part
especially
since
some
of
the
part
appear
to
be
miss
.
there
be
one
good
point
where

other
than
that
,
the
effect
be
second-rate
.
the

be

be
the

almost
make

it
do
not

.
she
look

,

but
there
be
no

.
fienne
fare
even
less
well
.
macnee
's
steed
be
a
witty
man
of
the
world
with
a
sense
of
humor
.
fienne
'

come
across
as
a
dour

who
have
never
be
out

.
even
connery
,
one
of
the
greatest
living
actor
,
do
not
have
much
of
a

outside
of

but
even
if
,
with
the
utmost
effort
,
you
be
able
to
care
about
any
of
it
,
the
scene
be
bewilder
.
the
primary
allure
of
the
original
be
the
interaction
between
the
two
lead
.
witty
banter
and
a
underplayed
sexual
tension
be
a
win
combination
.
admittedly
there
be
a
few
humorous
sexual
pun
in
the
film
,
but
there
be
no
chemistry
and
the
repartee
be
anything
but
clever
.

the

.
connery
refuse
to
promote
the
film
.
there
be
no
screening
for
critic
which
may
have
be
a
good
choice
for
warner
brother
.
at
least
this
way
,
they
get
something
of
a
audience
for
the
first
weekend
before
the
news
get
out
.
admittedly
i
have
not
see
a
episode
of
the
television
series
for
a
couple
of
decade
.
my
guess
be
that
it
would
be
severely
date
now
.
no
matter
how
antiquated
it
might
be
,
there
be
no
doubt
that
it
hold
up
better
than
this
film
be
at
first
viewing
.
there
be
no
reason
to
waste
any
part
of
the
last
few
day
of
summer
inside
watch
this

.
no
reason
at
all
.
