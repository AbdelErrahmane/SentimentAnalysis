i-2
,
the
sequel
to
mission
impossible
,
be
a
jame
bond
wannabe
film
,
but
it
fail
to
even
come
close
to
that
film
in
wit
,
humor
,
and
entertainment
value
.
it
try
to
be
a
spy\/romance
movie
,
but
without
any
suspense
the
film
just
look
like
it
be
a
extended
commercial
for
dude
who
think
they
look
cool
in
throwaway
sunglass
.
it
be
a
film
that
prefer
techie
gadget
to
anything
human
.
the
coolest
thing
about
this
movie
,
be
all
the
hole
it
have
in
its
story
and
the
most
trite
thing
about
the
movie
,
be
the
usage
of
dove
throughout
as
peace
symbol
.
the
film
play
as
if
it
be
a
wet
fantasy
dream
about
techie
violence
.
except
for
the
choreographed
action
sequence
,
the
film
be
dull
for
three-quarter
of
its
time
,
fill
with
too
many
dead
spot
in
its
story
to
garner
concern
about
its
wooden
character
or
the
superficial
romance
that
develop
.
as
for
the
action
scene
,
they
might
look
good
to
those
who
be
convert
to
violence
in
they
film
,
but
they
advertisement
for
sadistic
response
,
be
nothing
short
of
mindless
cartoon
violence
,
which
make
it
very
difficult
to
sit
back
and
applaud
without
feeling
put
off
by
the
gratuitous
cruelty
see
.
m
:
i-2
open
and
close
with
fast-paced
action
scene
,
but
it
be
hard
to
get
past
the
middle
part
which
just
drag
on
in
banal
dialogue
.
the
film
look
as
if
it
have
be
invade
by
a
computer
virus
,
at
that
point
.
the
only
thing
that
keep
I
awake
,
be
the
horrible
music
compose
by
han
zimmer
that
become
very
loud
at
any
of
the
film
's
supposedly
momentous
action
scene
and
seem
to
make
a
uninteresting
scene
even
more
noticeable
in
the
wrong
way
.
it
be
a
mega-buck
film
adapt
from
a
popular
high-tech
gadgetry
tv
series
.
but
its
artistic
success
be
a
impossible
task
to
accomplish
because
it
hire
the
wrong
director
and
actor
to
star
in
it
,
and
it
fail
to
produce
a
story
that
have
any
substance

than
a

as

try

while

and
seem

one
.
they
romance
do
not
work
,
not
only
be
it
tepid
and
not

,
but
it
be
not
convincing
.
the
film
open
with
dizzying
speed
,
perhaps
with
the
hope
that
a
befuddle
audience
be
its
best
bet
for
success
.
we
will
be
in
three
different
location
instantaneously
:
sydney
,
the
american
southwest
,
and
seville
.
first
,
we
be
in
sydney
,
australium
,
where
a
scientist
with
a
muffle
russian
accent
,
dr
.
nekhorvich
-lrb-
rade
-rrb-
,
mention
that
he
create
a
deadly
killer
virus
call
chimera
and
a
antidote
for
it
.
he
also
mention
that
every
hero
need
a
worthy
villain
.
which
explain
the
film
's
mythic
theme
...
as
we
enter
the
world
of
comic
book
myth
on
good
and
evil
.
the
one
who
play
the
villain
,
dougray
scott
,
do
so
in
a
one-dimensional
gruff
tone
,
which
do
not
distinguish
he
in
that
role
.
at
least
,
if
the
film
get
the
villain
part
right
,
it
might
have
have
some
fun
with
this
nonsense
.
soon
the
diabolical
scientist
be
on
a
plane
talk
to
someone
he
trust
call
dimitrus
,
but
then
the
plane
be
take
over
by
terrorist
who
set
it
on
automatic
pilot
and
crash
it
into
the
rocky
mountain
.
before
they
crash
the
plane
and
parachute
out
of
it
,
the
one
who
be
pose
as
dimitrus
,
turn
out
to
be
sean
ambrose
-lrb-
scott
-rrb-
,
a
rogue
member
of
the
imf
,
which
be
a
cia-like
clone
.
he
steal
the
package
with
the
antidote
,
peel
off
a
latex
mask
,
which
be
a
replica
of
the
hero
of
the
story
,
ethan
hunt
-lrb-
cruise
-rrb-
,
who
have
pose
as
dimitrus
to
the
scientist
before
and
have
thereby
gain
he
trust
.
sean
and
he
group
of
terrorist
carry
out
this
attack
because
they
plan
a
virus
plague
on
the
world
and
then
to
sell
the
victim
the
antidote
at
mark
up
price
.
we
already
see
the
gimmick
of
peel
mask
use
in
face\/off
and
in
the
original
mission
impossible
,
which
as
convolute
a
plot
as
that
film
have
,
it
be
still
a
superior
film
to
this
sequel
.
woo
have
run
this
peel
mask
routine
into
the
ground
,
as
it
be
use
so
often
in
this
film
by
both
side
,
so
much
so
,
that
it
blur
any
ethical
character
difference
between
good
guy
or
villain
.
it
make
it
seem
as
if
anyone
could
be
another
character
,
which
distort
the
reality
of
the
film
and
make
it
impossible
for
the
film
to
make
much
sense
.
next
we
be
in
a
mountain
range
in
the
american
southwest
,
and
ethan
be
on
vacation
,
hang
by

,
when

with
the

it
