there
be
a
good
,
and
timely
,
story
trap
deep
within
the
excess
of
murder
in
the
first
,
a
new
movie
about
the
abuse
of
we
prison
system
.
with
a
country
wrap
up
in
feverish
debate
over
the
crime
issue
and
the
rights
of
the
accuse
and
the
incarcerate
in
jeopardy
,
this
expose
would
offer
something
rare
to
recent
american
movie
--
a
point
of
view
.
but
director
marc
rocco
make
it
clear
from
the
beginning
that
pretentious
,
often
nauseating
,
camera
movement
and
slick
,
mtv
-
style
lighting
and
editing
be
far
more
important
.
there
be
not
a
moment
in
the
picture
where
he
surrender
technique
for
pure
storytelling
.
and
everything
suffer
.
christian
slater
and
kevin
bacon
star
as
defense
attorney
and
alcatraz
inmate
,
respectively
.
after
spend
a
unprecedented
amount
of
time
in
a
isolate
cell
for
attempt
to
escape
,
bacon
murder
another
prisoner
and
face
trial
.
he
young
lawyer
-lrb-
slater
-rrb-
be
fresh
out
of
law
school
but
determine
to
''
put
alcatraz
on
trial
''
for
the
abuse
of
it
warden
-lrb-
gary
oldman
-rrb-
.
the
result
be
the
usual
courtroom
theatric
-
imagine
a
stanley
kramer
production
shoot
by
hyperactive
film
school
student
.
there
be
very
little
to
praise
here
outside
of
kevin
bacon
's
earnest
overacting
and
the
appropriate
story
.
there
be
a
lot
of
overact
from
everyone
--
you
know
you
be
in
trouble
right
away
when
r
.
lee
ermey
-lrb-
the
drill
sergeant
in
full
metal
jacket
-rrb-
be
cast
as
a
judge
,
the
center
of
reason
and
moderation
.
slater
have
never
be
convince
and
certainly
be
not
here
and
oldman
be
on
a
bad
streak
of
hammy
performance
.
but
the
worst
feeling
you
get
while
watch
murder
in
the
first
be
that
the
man
behind
the
camera
could
care
less
about
tell
a
good
story
.
there
be
long
exchange
of
dialogue
where
the
camera
be
not
even
move
near
the
character
,
let
alone
with
they
.
how
frustrate
it
must
be
for
actor
to
work
under
these
condition
.
if
there
be
anything
that
have
alway
distinguish
american
film
over
the
rest
of
the
world
,
it
be
we
ability
to
tell
a
good
story
.
have
we
forget
?
