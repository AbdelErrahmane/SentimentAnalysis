i
be
guess
--
and
from
the
available
evidence
,
it
be
not
a
great
guess
--
that
burn
hollywood
burn
begin
life
as
a
insider
satire
of
hollywood
excess
,
stupidity
,
ego
and
power-mongering
.
if
so
,
the
film
that
end
up
on
the
screen
rank
as
one
of
the
most
spectacularly
ironic
unintentional
joke
in
film
history
.
it
have
already
be
well-documented
that
the
original
title
,
a
alan
smithee
film
,
become
a
problem
when
miserable
test
screening
force
re-cut
against
the
will
of
director
arthur
hiller
,
prompt
hiller
himself
to
opt
for
the
director
'
guild-mandated
pseudonym
of
alan
smithee
.
that
leave
a
film
satire
in
the
hand
of
writer
joe
eszterha
,
as
humorless
a
hack
as
ever
put
finger
to
word
processor
.
and
you
could
just
smell
the
disaster
brewing
.
if
you
be
unfortunate
enough
to
sit
through
burn
hollywood
burn
,
you
'll
still
be
smell
that
disaster
long
after
the
light
come
up
.
ostensibly
,
it
be
a
pseudo-documentary
account
of
a
director
name
alan
smithee
-lrb-
eric
idle
-rrb-
who
lose
control
of
a
big-budget

and
jackie
chan
-lrb-
all
of
whom
appear
as
themselves

when
the
only
recourse
available
to
he
be
abandon
the
project
to
be
call
''
a
alan
smithee
film
''
--
which
,
of
course
,
it
already
be
--
smithee
steal
the
negative
of
the
film
and
threaten
to
destroy
it
.
among
the
party
interview
be
the

's
producer

-rrb-
and
studio
boss
jerry

,
who
spend
virtually
the
entire
film
narrate
the
story
while
painfully
unfunny
thing
go
on
around
they
.
it
be
bad
enough
that
burn
hollywood
burn
have
--
literally
--
not
a
single
laugh
for
its
entire
,
blissfully
brief
84
minute
.
what
make
it
even
worse
be
eszterha
'
insistence
upon
tell
every
bad
joke
not
once
,
but
twice
or
even
three
time
.

those

for

allow
the
best
insight
into
what
be

hideously
wrong
with

not
content
to
stick
any

eszterha
fill
the

with

with

you

it
do
not
even
matter
that
eszterha
tag
''
penile
implant
''
after
he
own
name
when
he
make
a
cameo
,
because
it
seem
like
such
a
desperate
attempt
to
feign
self-deprecation
.
this
be
a
petulant
schoolboy
's
idea
of
satire
--
picture
of
hollywood
insider
to
which
eszterha
have
take
a
pen
to
draw
little
moustache
and
black
out
the
tooth
.
the
last
stomach-churning
straw
come
when
burn
hollywood

close
with
out-take
over
the
closing
credit
,
the
kind
that
show
the
audience
how
much
fun
everyone
be
have
make
the
film
that
just
suck
a
hour
and
a
half
of
you
life
away
.
perhaps
it
be
just
a
final
,
desperate
attempt
by
eszterha
to
convince
himself
there
be
some
purpose
behind
the
film
,
or
to
convince
everyone
involve
that
a
few
blow
line

threaten
to
blow
they
whole
career
.
pity
everyone
involve
with
this
excessive
,
ego-driven
''
satire
''
of
excess
and
ego
.
it
be
too
bad
that
only
director
can
remove
they
name
from
noxious
material
like
this
.
otherwise
,
you
might
have
see
credit
for
