to
put
it
bluntly
,
ed
wood
would
have
be
proud
of
this
.
a
totally
ridiculous
plot
be
encompass
with
bad
humor
,
hokey
drama
,
zero
logic
and
a
crap
screenplay
.
also
,
a
beautifully
anti-climactic
end
.
not
to
say
it
do
not
look
intriguing
when
i
see
the
preview
.
so
much
for
truth
in
advertising
.
roland
emmerich
,
who
be
later
''
independence
day
''
would
look
like
''
the
400
blow
''
compare
to
this
,
co-writed
and
direct
this
inane
sci-fus
film
which
use
the
cliche
of
there
be
some
connection
between
eqypt
and
alien
.
in
a
useless
opening
sequence
,
man
find
a
stone
in
1914
with
hieroglyphic
on
it
.
it
would
not
be
till
present
day
-lrb-
'94
-rrb-
till
they
would
actually
figure
it
out
.
they
be
decipherer
?
a
slightly-neurotic
scientist
-lrb-
nice
twist
-rrb-
,
dr
.
dan
jackson
-lrb-
jame
spader
,
do
he
best
outside
of
erotic
thriller
and
some
indy
fare
-rrb-
who
be
life
suck
so
much
that
people
walk
out
of
he
lecture
after
the
third
word
.
why
do
they
use
he
to
decipher
what
no
one
else
could
?
so
there
be
a
hokey
end
!
duh
!
he
figure
it
out
in
about
a
minute
.
yea
.
and
then
they
get
a
suicidal
colonel
or
something
,
''
jack
''
o'neill
-lrb-
kurt
russel
,
with
he
wyat
earp
lock
in
the
begin
then
a
flat-top
that
would
make
howie
long
snap
into
a
fetal
position
-rrb-
.
why
a
suicidal
colonel
?
for
the
end
!
you
'll
get
the
hang
of
this
.
they
open
the
stargate
,
a
bunch
of
they
go
through
it
with
a
bomb
to
blow
it
up
if
they
find
anything
bad
.
after
a
overdo
special
effect
thing
,
they
be
...
inside
a
goddam
pyramid
.
so
they
go
to
egypt
,
right
?
wrong
.
they
be
on
another
planet
that
be
film
in
egypt
.
they
discover
a
cilvilization
rule
by
ra
,
the
sun
god
-lrb-
the
androginous
jaye
davidson
,
with
a
voice
modifier
to
make
he
sound
like
barry
white
with
asthma
-rrb-
,
and
there
be
fight
,
explosion
and
a
kiss
between
two
people
.
yea
.
also
melodrama
,
stupidity
,
hokey
scene
and
a
bizarre
language
.
a
anti-climactic
end
end
with
stupid
line
-lrb-
''
say
hello
to
king
tut
,
asswhole
!
''
-
the
quintessential
line
,
lemme
tell
ya
-rrb-
and
some
convenient
pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character
development
.
by
the
end
,
you
just
wanna
go
home
and
watch
,
i
do
not
know
,
the
''
outer
limit
''
or
something
.
the
script
's
terrible
.
the
special
effect
be
okay
,
but
nothing
great
.
the
story
's
so
weak
that
it
be
almost
opaque
.
the
whole
experience
just
be
not
worth
it
unless
you
be
so
bore
that
you
would
consider
watch
a
''
full
house
''
marathon
...
or
this
.
i
would
pick
this
,
obviously
,
but
still
,
it
be
just
not
fun
at
all
.
and
i
can
not
wait
for
it
to
premier
on
mst3k
.
