movie
like
six
day
,
seven
night
make
I
mad
because
talented
people
like
harrison
ford
,
anne
heche
,
and
ivan
reitman
put
a
lot
of
hard
work
in
to
a
script
worth
about
ten
cent
.
?
the
script
be
write
by
michael
browning
,
and
he
decide
that
,
instead
of
think
up
new
idea
,
he
would
rehash
a
lot
of
cliche
,
omit
even
the
slightest
bit
of
character
development
,
and
then
throw
in
drug-dealing
pirate
to
provide
for
a
few
high-level
action
sequence
and
explosion
.
?
there
be
good
script
out
there
that
high-profile
actor
can
make
-lrb-
see
the
truman
show
,
for
instance
-rrb-
.
?
six
day
,
seven
night
be
simply
a
waste
.
let
's
see
.
.
.
we
have
to
get
harrison
ford
and
anne
heche
alone
on
a
island
.
?
so
,
how
do
we
do
that
?
?
well
,
we
'll
make
she
a
feisty
magazine
editor
,
and
we
'll
make
he
a
crusty
old
pilot
.
?
but
wait
,
she
have
to
have
a
fianc
?
e
;
that
can
be
david
schwimmer
.
?
but
wait
,
if
she
have
a
fianc
?
e
,
how
will
she
and
harrison
ford
crash
on
the
island
alone
?
?
i
know
!
?
they
'll
get
to
they
vacation
spot
,
and
then
she
'll
get
call
back
!
?
yessssss
!
?
so
,
they
'll
crash
on
the
island
,
and
that
will
be
funny
for
about
five
minute
.
?
shuck
.
oh
,
i
have
get
it
!
?
we
'll
throw
in
a
distracting
subplot
in
which
she
fianc
?
e
have
sex
with
a
really
attractive
woman
who
act
like
a
bimbo
,
and
then
he
can
feel
guilty
.
?
then
,
when
anne
heche
kiss
harrison
ford
-lrb-
they
have
to
kiss
,
because
otherwise
nobody
will
want
to
see
the
movie
-rrb-
,
it
will
be
a
vindicate
action
,
because
she
fianc
?
e
will
already
have
cheat
on
she
!
?
then
,
for
no
obvious
reason
,
they
'll
accidentally
run
into
pirate
who
try
to
kill
they
.
?
oh
,
yes
!
?
i
feel
so
good
about
this
story
.
?
instead
of
use
characterization
to
propel
the
event
,
it
will
be
completely
random
,
and
yet
totally
predictable
!
?
imagine
that
.
do
not
get
I
wrong
--
six
day
,
seven
night
be
not
a
boring
picture
;
ford
and
heche
both
do
a
great
job
.
?
the
spark
fly
between
they
,
and
so
most
of
browning
's
inane
dialogue
be
drown
out
by
the
actor
'
sheer
force
of
talent
.
?
almost
every
scene
between
they
have
energy
that
the
performer
bring
to
the
screen
,
and
i
find
myself
laugh
pretty
hard
.
?
schwimmer
be
also
funny
,
and
manage
to
milk
all
of
he
scene
for
whatever
he
can
get
.
?
and
reitman
,
who
have
make
some
good
film
,
at
least
try
to
make
thing
exciting
.
?
even
though
the
pirate
subplot
be
profoundly
dumb
,
i
be
prepare
to
be
pleasantly
sidetrack
by
the
action
sequence
.
it
be
just
when
i
start
to
think
about
the
story
that
my
contempt
for
this
film
surface
.
?
the
picture
feel
like
it
be
be
hack
to
piece
--
i
would
not
be
surprise
if
five
or
six
inept
subplot
have
be
edit
out
completely
.
?
the
one
that
be
here
be
as
bad
as
they
come
-lrb-
i
think
i
let
out
a
very
audible
groan
when
they
get
the
first
glimpse
of
the
pirate
ship
-rrb-
,
and
i
would
just
like
to
shake
the
producer
by
the
shoulder
and
scream
,
''
why
do
you
pick
this
awful
script
!
?
''
?
the
film
be
outright
stupid
,
but
some
of
the
element
be
subtly
horrifying
.
?
for
instance
,
take
the
subplot
in
which
the
schwimmer
character
have
sex
with
the
bimbo
,
and
then
feel
really
guilty
.
?
this
be
a
serious
problem
in
real
life
,
but
six
day
,
seven
night
reduce
any
chance
of
complexity
to
a
weak
plot
device
:
?
he
action
be
what
make
it
okay
for
heche
to
kiss
ford
.
?
in
a
script
that
lack
even
a
glimpse
of
intelligent
subtlety
,
i
find
it
odd
that
such
a
strangely
insulting
device
end
up
in
the
story
.
this
be
summer
movie
season
,
but
that
do
not
mean
we
movie
have
to
be
dumb
.
?
1998
so
far
have
be
one
of
the
worst
year
in
recent
memory
for
summer
blockbuster
.
?
when
i
be
in
line
for
six
day
,
seven
night
,
i
hear
the
woman
in
front
of
I
ask
for
''
two
ticket
to
that
new
harrison
ford
movie
.
''
?
why
do
not
she
know
the
name
of
the
film
?
?
i
suppose
she
just
do
not
care
.
?
what
bother
I
even
more
be
that
the
people
who
make
these
big-budget
picture
do
not
realize
that
they
film
be
become
parody
of
themselves
.
?
good
actor
should
sign
to
good
script
,
and
if
hollywood
insist
on
make
flick
to
rake
in
cash
,
they
least
they
could
do
be
assume
that
we
would
like
to
spend
we
money
on
a
story
worth
more
than
ten
cent
.
