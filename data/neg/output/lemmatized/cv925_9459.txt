everybody
in
this
film
's
thinking
of
alicium
.
no
,
this
be
not
a
documentary
on
those
of
we
after
we
first
see
the
''
cryin
'
''
video
.
this
be
one
of
those
erotic
thriller
,
but
not
like
one
star
shannon
whirry
or
shannon
tweed
.
first
off
,
there
be
zero
sex
,
almost
no
nudity
,
and
it
be
not
as
well-plotted
as
one
of
those
tweed
flick
.
well
,
anyway
.
the
''
plot
.
''
alicium
play
,
well
,
the
babysitter
,
who
be
take
care
of
some
kid
one
night
while
the
parent
-lrb-
j
.
t
.
walsh
and
lee
garlington
-rrb-
go
out
to
a
party
.
the
film
,
try
to
be
like
one
of
those
introspective
erotic
thriller
,
show
every
character
'
thought
,
except
alicium
's
.
the
thing
be
alicium
's
in
most
of
they
in
most
case
,
and
the
thought
be
not
too
kosher
.
first
off
,
there
be
she
boyfriend
-lrb-
jeremy
london
,
who
give
one
of
the
all-time
lousy
performance
in
''
mallrat
,
''
and
be
only
a
notch
better
here
-rrb-
,
who
be
a
dorky
kid
who
hang
out
with
a
kind
of
bully
,
play
by
nicky
katt
from
''
suburbia
''
-lrb-
who
show
he
be
get
that
quiet
creepiness
down
pat
once
again
-rrb-
.
they
decide
they
want
to
crash
she
babysitting
job
,
look
for
the
typical
babysitting
hanky-panky
.
somethine
like
that
.
the
film
intercut
between
the
subplot
-lrb-
alicium
babysitting
,
nicky
and
jeremy
,
the
party
-rrb-
and
each
character
'
thought
.
we
get
to
see
jeremy
and
nicky
's
dream
of
do
a
little
threeway
with
alicium
,
j
.
t
.
thinking
of
come
home
to
find
alicium
naked
in
the
bathtub
-lrb-
she
have
it
all
cover
up
,
the
little
tease
-rrb-
,
and
,
worst
of
all
,
lee
garlington
dream
of
that
hunk
,
george
segal
.
it
even
show
they
in
bed
together
.
yea
.
i
so
want
to
see
george
and
lee
garlington
in
bed
,
though
i
guess
i
be
use
to
george
after
see
she
and
mary
tyler
moore
fool
around
in
''
flirt
with
disaster
.
''
the
end
be
some
kind
of
big
tragedy
thing
,
but
come
on
.
like
we
care
about
any
of
the
character
.
the
only
interesting
one
be
alicium
,
mainly
because
she
be
alicium
,
and
we
mostly
see
she
in
the
fantasy
.
so
i
guess
she
be
some
kind
of
mystery
or
something
.
but
she
be
never
explore
further
.
so
,
basically
,
this
film
be
just
a
series
of
mastabatory
image
,
sometimes
feature
a
non-nude
alicium
-lrb-
once
again
,
sadly
-rrb-
,
sometimes
feature
a
scantily-clad
george
segal
-lrb-
once
again
,
sadly
-rrb-
.
i
watch
this
on
one
of
those
free
preview
of
showtime
or
cinemax
one
night
,
and
let
I
tell
you
,
it
be
the
only
way
to
watch
this
film
.
i
mean
,
there
be
a
reason
they
put
these
kind
of
film
on
late
at
night
:
they
be
just
as
good
as
sleep
pill
.
and
this
one
be
one
big
fat
waste
of
time
,
even
for
a
alicium
film
.
