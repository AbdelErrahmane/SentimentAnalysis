i
wonder
if
budget
be
at
all
a
criterion
for
whether
or
not
a
movie
can
be
consider
a
exploitation
flick
.
take
the
professional
,
for
example
.
it
boast
extremely
glossy
cinematography
,
a
couple
of
recognizable
name
actor
,
and
a
couple
of
fairly
impressive
explosion
.
it
be
also
basically
about
violence
and
cheap
titilation
,
and
feature
a
central
relationship
between
a
middle-aged
man
and
a
twelve-year-old
girl
with
a
decidedly
ambiguous
sexual
dimension
.
the
professional
be
all
over
the
map
,
and
its
pretension
of
be
about
anything
more
than
its
most
unpleasant
element
simply
make
it
all
the
more
unpleasant
.
the
professional
of
the
title
be
a
new
york
hit
man
name
leon
-lrb-
jean
reno
-rrb-
,
brutally
efficient
but
also
very
isolate
.
one
day
he
be
force
to
let
someone
into
he
life
when
a
girl
from
he
apartment
building
knock
on
he
door
.
she
name
be
matilda
-lrb-
natalie
portman
-rrb-
,
and
the
rest
of
she
family
have
just
be
kill
by
crooked
and
very
wire
d
.
e
.
a
.
agent
norman
stansfield
-lrb-
gary
oldman
-rrb-
after
matilda
's
father
try
to
rip
he
off
.
leon
reluctantly
take
matilda
in
,
then
begin
to
teach
she
he
profession
when
she
say
that
she
want
to
avenge
the
murder
of
she
young
brother
.
the
two
become
closer
,
which
make
they
all
the
more
vulnerable
when
stansfield
learn
that
they
know
too
much
,
and
set
out
to
eliminate
they
both
.
writer\/director
luc
besson
have
go
this
route
before
with
he
popular
french
import
la
femme
nikita
,
a
slick
potboiler
about
a
female
assassin
.
there
be
no
question
that
besson
can
make
a
great
\*
look
\*
film
;
with
the
assistance
of
cinematographer
thierry
arbogast
,
he
have
create
a
film
chock
full
of
moody
close-up
and
evocative
lighting
.
but
beneath
the
shiny
wrapper
,
there
be
not
nearly
as
much
go
on
as
besson
would
like
we
to
believe
.
the
relationship
between
leon
and
matilda
never
click
because
neither
one
be
give
a
character
to
develop
.
leon
be
mostly
a
collection
of
quirky
trait
,
all
intend
to
show
we
that
for
a
hire
killer
,
he
be
really
not
so
bad
a
guy
:
he
drink
lot
of
milk
,
take
meticulous
care
of
a
potted
plant
,
and
enjoy
gene
kelly
movie
.
jean
reno
succeed
at
give
leon
a
haunt
and
desperate
quality
,
but
he
never
make
a
emotional
connection
to
matilda
.
natalie
portman
be
all
wrong
for
a
part
that
call
for
a
much
grittier
quality
,
but
she
do
not
have
too
much
to
work
with
,
either
.
besson
would
have
be
better
serve
spend
more
time
try
to
bring
he
character
to
life
,
and
less
on
feeble
attempt
at
humor
which
be
often
embarrassing
.
a
silly
game
between
leon
and
matilda
involve
celebrity
impersonation
be
completely
out
of
place
,
as
be
a
scene
where
matilda
shock
a
hotel
manager
by
announce
that
leon
be
she
lover
;
character
be
thoroughly
sacrifice
for
a
cheap
gag
.
gary
oldman
's
entire
part
be
something
of
a
cheap
gag
,
wild-eyed
and
way
over
the
top
,
but
at
least
he
be
interesting
to
watch
.
there
be
not
a
real
person
to
be
find
anywhere
in
the
professional
,
which
be
not
always
a
problem
in
a
action
thriller
,
except
that
this
one
be
try
to
pass
itself
off
as
something
more
.
a
more
disconcerting
problem
with
the
professional
be
that
it
play
around
with
the
sexuality
of
a
twelve-year-old
in
a
really
distasteful
way
.
there
be
only
two
real
choice
for
deal
with
that
component
of
leon
and
matilda
's
relationship
:
confront
it
head
on
,
or
ignore
it
entirely
.
but
besson
flirt
and
tease
the
audience
with
the
idea
that
he
be
go
to
show
they
a
forbid
love
story
,
while
choose
simply
to
focus
he
camera
on
portman
's
rear
end
and
dress
she
in
skimpy
clothing
.
this
be
to
say
nothing
of
the
questionable
decision
to
make
it
look
like
quality
paternal
time
when
leon
be
teach
a
child
to
load
a
9mm
pistol
,
or
the
blood
which
be
spill
aplenty
.
a
great
deal
of
the
time
,
the
professional
be
just
plain
sleazy
,
and
all
the
soft
filter
in
the
world
can
not
disguise
that
fact
.
