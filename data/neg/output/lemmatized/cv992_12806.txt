comment
:
allow
I
to
state
for
the
record
that
i
find
daryl
hannah
a
appealing
presence
in
movie
.
she
prove
quite
charming
as
the
intelligent
astronomer
in
the
romantic
comedy
roxanne
and
equally
creepy
as
pri
in
the
sci-fi
classic
blade
runner
.
the
clan
of
the
cave
bear
clearly
try
to
capitalize
on
hannah
as
a
selling
point
:
the
poster
art
bear
a
striking
closeup
of
hannah
in
tribal
paint
and
the
video
box
prominently
feature
she
name
in
letter
the
same
size
as
the
title
.
not
even
she
star
role
in
this
turkey
,
unfortunately
,
can
save
it
from
be
a
unbelievable
exercise
in
cheese
.
it
be
so
uniquely
bad
-lrb-
a
film
deal
with
prehistoric
man
that
actually
try
,
and
miserably
fail
,
to
be
serious
-rrb-
that
it
be
oddly
fascinating
.
the
ridiculous
attempt
at
drama
here
leave
the
audience
somehow
transfix
,
want
to
see
how
this
dud
play
out
.
the
clan
of
the
cave
bear
be
base
upon
a
popular
novel
by
jean
m
.
auel
.
to
this
day
,
the
book
possess
a
loyal
cult
follow
.
i
remember
a
dear
friend
of
mine
have
a
dog-eared
copy
of
the
novel
she
have
read
as
a
child
with
all
the
so-called
dirty
part
black
out
with
marker
by
she
grandmother
.
i
have
never
read
this
book
,
but
i
sure
hope
it
be
10
,
000
time
better
than
its
film
adaptation
.
if
not
,
then
i
be
at
a
complete
loss
to
explain
its
popularity
.
the
clan
of
the
cave
bear
immediately
open
with
a
comically
absurd
scene
.
a
young
aylum
,
look
much
like
draw
barrymore
in
e
.
t
.
,
tramp
about
in
the
wood
.
with
she
cute
little
ponytail
and
fur
wrap
about
she
,
the
audience
's
expectation
of
a
convincing
portrayal
of
prehistory
be
immediately
shatter
.
what
follow
be
a
laughably
choreographed
sequence
in
which
a
earthquake
swallow
up
aylum
's
mother
-lrb-
a
blonde
with
fur
pants
...
er
,
leggings
-rrb-
.
tearful
aylum
look
on
as
the
cameraman
shake
the
camera
...
well
,
as
the
earthquake
slowly
recede
.
a
hungry
lion
become
interested
in
she
for
lunch
,
but
the
scream
six-year-old
manage
to
outrun
the
king
of
the
wild
and
find
a
safe
haven
.
i
will
not
detail
the
story
any
further
;
this
seem
enough
to
illustrate
my
point
.
this
movie
be
really
stupid
.
it
never
even
give
the
audience
a
chance
to
suspend
they
disbelief
.
also
,
the
obvious
comparison
between
the
appearance
of
cro-magnon
man
in
prehistory
and
the
rise
of
feminism
in
we
century
be
about
as
subtle
as
burn
a
wonderbra
in
front
of
charlton
heston
.
the
movie
do
not
just
suggest
this
message
;
it
whack
the
message
into
the
audience
with
a
two-by-four
.
a
blond
,
gorgeous
woman
challenge
the
social
law
of
a
bunch
of
people
in
gaudy
brown
wig
.
she
be
of
the
''
new
people
''
;
they
be
of
the
''
old
people
''
with
''
the
memory
.
''
yep
.
we
get
it
.
we
get
it
.
the
clan
of
the
cave
bear
apparently
receive
a
academy
award
nomination
for
best
make-up
,
which
surprise
I
.
the
movie
depend
upon
a
lot
of
make-up
obviously
,
but
much
of
it
be
unconvincing
.
as
state
before
,
daryl
hannah
be
daryl
hannah
here
;
she
look
like
she
just
step
out
of
the
shower
all
the
time
.
the
rest
of
the
character
have
dark
make-up
of
some
sort
smear
over
they
to
look
like
dirt
.
the
face-painting
that
be
occasionally
see
be
perhaps
the
only
notable
work
here
in
my
mind
.
this
movie
also
suffer
from
its
new
age
trappings
.
maybe
the
music
sound
a
lot
more
fresh
or
original
during
1985
,
but
now
it
sound
dated
and
cliched
,
like
poorly
conceive
elevator
music
.
add
to
this
the
film
's
faux-mysticism
,
include
spirit
animal
and
dream
vision
,
and
a
narrator
who
sound
like
a
psychic
you
would
expect
to
hear
on
a
1-900
number
,
and
you
get
a
movie
that
have
serious
problem
be
serious
.
the
clan
of
the
cave
bear
be
rate
r
,
though
it
be
probably
one
of
the
most
inoffensive
offensive
film
i
have
see
in
quite
a
while
.
it
contain
several
scene
of
sex
san
nudity
.
the
violence
mostly
consist
of
hunting
scene
.
the
funniest
moment
of
the
movie
occur
when
a
neanderthal
in
love
with
aylum
attempt
to
rescue
she
from
a
ferocious
bear
.
the
bear
bite
he
head
off
and
the
audience
see
it
roll
about
.
although
this
may
sound
gratuitous
,
i
be
sure
,
it
be
so
cheesy
that
it
probably
will
not
bother
most
people
.
the
clan
of
the
cave
bear
be
a
bad
movie
.
however
,
as
i
write
at
the
beginning
of
this
review
,
it
do
have
the
distinction
of
originality
.
typically
when
i
think
of
bottom-of-the-barrel
film
deal
with
early
man
,
fantasy
movie
involve
dinosaur
-lrb-
who
do
not
exist
at
the
same
time
as
man
-rrb-
and
raquel
welch
come
to
mind
.
the
clan
of
the
cave
bear
try
so
hard
to
be
serious
that
,
though
it
be
so
bad
,
the
audience
be
still
interest
by
the
unique
setting
and
character
of
the
movie
-lrb-
which
be
why
i
award
this
turkey
two
star
-rrb-
.
i
have
to
think
that
fan
of
the
book
would
be
disappoint
with
this
film
version
;
however
,
i
be
only
base
this
observation
on
the
fact
that
the
book
be
almost
invariably
better
than
the
movie
.
i
shudder
to
think
that
it
could
be
otherwise
...
