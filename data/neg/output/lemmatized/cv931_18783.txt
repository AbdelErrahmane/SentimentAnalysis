it
be
a
sad
state
of
affair
when
the
back
box
blurb
be
more
exciting
than
the
movie
contain
within
it
.
such
be
the
case
for
the
1990
paul
mayersberg
film
_
the
last
samurai
_
.
though
the
blurb
allude
to
''
a
jungle
fill
with
political
intrigue
,
uneasy
alliance
,
and
murderous
enemy
at
every
turn
,
''
the
story
of
the
movie
be
actually
quite
simple
-lrb-
and
prosaic
-rrb-
:
a
middle-aged
japanese
businessman
name
endo
-lrb-
play
by
john
fujioka
-rrb-
and
he
assistant
,
both
of
whom
have
samurai
aspiration
,
travel
to
africa
in
search
of
he
ancestor
,
who
go
to
bring
buddhism
to
africa
.
he
hire
the
service
of
down-at-the-heel
vietnam
veteran
pilot
johnny
congo
-lrb-
the
redoubtable
lance
henriksen
-rrb-
and
he
girlfriend
-lrb-
arabellum
holzbog
-rrb-
,
and
travels
to
the
camp
of
a
arms-merchant-cum-safari-host
-
cum-islamic-missionary
-lrb-
john
saxon
-rrb-
and
he
wife
-lrb-
lisa
eilbacher
-rrb-
.
they
be
all
kidnap
by
a
african
revolutionary
guerilla
with
witch-doctor
aspiration
to
conceal
a
pre-arranged
arm
deal
,
which
subsequently
fall
through
.
congo
escape
,
find
endo
's
ancestor
's
sword
,
and
come
back
,
gun
blaze
,
to
free
the
rest
of
they
,
and
endo
kill
the
revolutionary
with
the
sword
.
the
end
.
_
the
last
samurai
_
be
one
of
those
movie
that
be
neither
bad
enough
nor
good
enough
to
be
enjoyable
.
it
be
merely
_
there
_
.
the
murky
plot
be
fill
with
subtext
that
be
never
elaborate
,
subplot
that
be
never
explain
,
and
many
scene
that
make
very
little
sense
at
all
.
the
film
be
shoot
through
with
all
the
tired
old
''
inscrutable
japanese
samurai
''
and
zen
stereotype
that
be
to
be
expect
from
a
american
movie
.
it
be
quite
slow-paced
,
with
only
a
bit
of
action
near
the
end
,
and
the
final
duel
between
endo
and
the
terrorist
be
quite
anticlimactic
.
most
of
the
acting
be
fair
,
with
the
possible
exception
of
congo
's
girlfriend
.
lance
henriksen
be
he
usual
scene-chewing
self
,
and
be
one
of
few
possible
reason
anyone
might
conceivably
have
for
see
this
movie
.
the
only
other
bright
spot
be
the
sweeping
african
scenery
.
i
pay
$
3
for
this
film
,
from
the
discount
rack
at
best
buy
,
and
halfway
suspect
i
overpay
for
it
.
if
you
be
in
the
mood
for
samurai
,
read
a
clavell
novel
or
watch
a
kurusawa
movie
.
skip
_
the
last
samurai
_
unless
you
be
a
die-hard
henriksen
fan
.
