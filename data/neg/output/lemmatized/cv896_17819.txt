what
would
inspire
someone
who
can
not
write
or
act
to
pen
and
star
in
a
movie
?
a
better
question
,
what
would
inspire
a
studio
to
produce
say
movie
?
if
you
have
a
answer
,
let
I
know
.
foolish
,
the
new
movie
write
by
and
star
master
p
be
a
jaw-droppingly
horrible
film
,
one
with
no
redeeming
value
socially
,
cinematically
or
otherwise
.
comedically
it
have
some
potential
,
but
only
in
its
stand-up
comedy
moment
,
which
i
can
turn
on
comedy
central
for
.
master
p
star
as
fifty
dollah
'
-lrb-
beat
that
!
-rrb-
as
a
mobster
-lrb-
i
think
-rrb-
who
be
try
to
start
a
comedy
club\/act
with
he
little
brother
foolish
-lrb-
eddie
griffin
-rrb-
.
but
the
two
of
they
have
to
deal
with
a
angry
mob
boss
-lrb-
play
by
andrew
dice
clay
,
for
the
very
first
time
entertaining
-rrb-
,
a
stubborn
club
owner
and
family
problem
-lrb-
the
latter
in
foolish
be
a
perfect
example
of
roger
ebert
's
''
idiot
plot
,
''
if
everyone
here
be
not
a
idiot
,
there
would
be
no
problem
-rrb-
so
what
do
foolish
have
to
offer
beside
a
bunch
of
idiotic
character
name
?
not
a
hell
of
a
lot
.
as
i
have
mention
,
master
p
can
not
act
or
write
.
he
act
like
the
rapper
that
he
be
.
the
occasional
despair
that
he
script
require
he
to
exhibit
be
excruciatingly
force
,
as
be
he
warm
and
fuzzy
scene
with
he
little
bro
.
as
for
he
script
--
well
,
i
suppose
he
deliver
what
one
would
expect
from
a
musical
artist
with
no
previous
screenwriting
experience
.
if
you
have
not
yet
figure
it
out
,
that
be
not
say
much
.
co-star
eddie
griffin
-lrb-
really
the
star
of
the
show
-rrb-
be
quite
a
different
story
.
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
griffin
,
whose
most
significant
screen
outing
to
date
be
probably
the
mildly
successful
tv
show
malcolm
and
eddie
on
the
fledgling
upn
network
,
be
a
extremely
talented
comedian
,
stand-up
and
otherwise
.
he
have
much
in
common
with
chri
tucker
-lrb-
rush
hour
,
money
talk
-rrb-
in
how
quickly
and
effortlessly
he
speech
flow
from
he
lip
.
he
spout
profanity
with
impressive
dexterity
-lrb-
to
the
extent
which
that
can
be
do
-rrb-
,
and
while
i
hope
that
do
not
become
he
trademark
it
work
in
a
few
scene
in
this
movie
.
and
indeed
,
i
laugh
at
a
few
stand-up
scene
here
,
but
from
a
feature-length
movie
i
expect
more
.
foolish
provide
I
with
no
reason
to
care
for
these
character
.
every
scene
which
have
any
potential
for
dramatic
impact
be
effectively
diffuse
by
either
a
stupid
joke
-lrb-
in
a
scene
where
tension
escalate
between
the
two
brother
,
foolish
blurt
out
towards
he
jewelry-sporting
sibling
''
you
lay
one
hand
on
I
and
this
cemetary
be
go
to
be
a
gold
rush
''
-rrb-
or
something
even
more
idiotic
such
as
foolish
smash
he
own
car
-lrb-
to
which
i
say
,
a
bit
too
loudly
for
the
occasion
''
huh
?
''
-rrb-
after
get
slightly
upset
with
he
wife
.
believe
I
when
i
say
that
there
be
nothing
in
foolish
that
warrant
parting
with
you
hard-earned
$
8
.
you
'll
get
more
laugh
from
watch
30
minute
of
comedy
central
or
any
virtually
any
sitcom
if
you
do
not
have
cable
.
eddie
griffin
fan
may
enjoy
this
derivative
-lrb-
although
offensive
-rrb-
yarn
,
but
everyone
else
should
stay
the
hell
away
.
