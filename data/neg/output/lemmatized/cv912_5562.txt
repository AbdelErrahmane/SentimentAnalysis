my
inner
flag
be
at
half-mast
last
year
when
nick
at
nite
pull
''
dragnet
''
rerun
off
the
air
.
sure
,
i
would
see
they
all
at
least
once
,
but
i
could
always
count
on
at
least
a
few
inadvertent
laugh
from
ultra-serious
jack
webb
when
there
be
nothing
else
on
tv
.
even
though
''
dragnet
''
be
out
of
circulation
at
the
moment
,
we
webb
anti-fan
still
have
the
d
.
i
.
,
a
50
's
propaganda
piece
for
the
military
that
be
almost
as
hilarious
as
the
famous
''
blue
boy
''
episode
of
''
dragnet
.
''
for
anyone
like
I
who
get
laugh
out
of
webb
's
rapid-fire
speech
and
straight-faced
seriousness
,
think
of
the
d
.
i
.
as
what
would
happen
if
sgt
.
joe
Friday
ever
enlist
,
because
he
play
exactly
the
same
character
here
,
a
no-nonsense
old
fart
who
look
with
disdain
at
the
younger
generation
and
love
to
give
long
-
winded
,
melodramatic
speech
on
any
topic
.
in
this
election
year
,
i
be
more
convinced
than
ever
that
webb
and
bob
dole
be
separate
at
birth
.
the
movie
open
in
characteristic
fashion
as
one
recruit
after
another
knock
on
webb
's
office
door
and
enter
.
he
give
each
one
a
different
series
of
cranky
criticism
before
the
credit
come
up
.
the
''
produce
and
direct
by
jack
webb
''
card
pretty
much
go
without
say
.
this
be
he
movie
all
the
way
,
and
after
the
first
twenty
minute
of
he
chew
out
he
recruit
for
no
reason
,
i
be
wonder
if
there
would
even
be
a
plot
.
i
certainly
would
have
be
entertain
by
a
hour
and
a
half
of
trademark
webb
rant
,
but
the
d
.
i
.
give
we
more
--
much
more
.
webb
's
mission
be
to
make
a
man
out
of
private
owen
,
the
local
screw-up
.
the
captain
give
webb
three
day
to
convert
owen
into
marine
material
or
,
the
captain
will
''
personally
cut
the
lace
off
he
panties
and
ship
he
out
myself
.
''
-lrb-
whether
the
''
lace
panties
''
part
refer
to
webb
or
owen
remain
unanswered
.
-rrb-
this
,
of
course
,
give
webb
a
excuse
to
focus
all
he
crotchety
energy
on
make
owen
'
life
a
living
hell
.
for
those
of
you
who
have
not
be
indoctrinate
into
the
pleasure
of
webb
watch
,
here
be
a
reprint
of
a
typical
monologue
of
he
.
i
can
not
duplicate
he
hilarious
delivery
on
paper
,
but
the
word
should
at
least
partially
convey
what
i
be
talk
about
...
''
now
you
listen
to
I
,
youngster
.
someday
you
'll
wake
up
fight
on
a
beach
and
you
'll
pray
to
god
somebody
do
not
get
kill
because
of
you
foolishness
...
i
have
get
a
headline
for
you
:
every
time
you
make
one
of
those
little
mistake
of
yours
,
you
be
gonna
turn
around
and
i
'll
be
stand
right
there
.
''
i
could
not
write
down
all
the
reprintable
dialogue
from
the
d
.
i
.
-lrb-
nearly
all
of
it
belong
in
the
bad
movie
hall
of
fame
-rrb-
,
but
i
try
to
include
some
of
the
more
noteworthy
line
,
like
one
from
the
scene
where
webb
unwind
from
a
hard
day
's
work
by
go
to
the
local
bar
-lrb-
where
he
order
a
tomato
juice
-rrb-
.
he
meet
a
woman
who
,
coincidentally
,
also
order
tomato
juice
but
walk
away
from
a
typically-stimulating
conversation
with
webb
to
flirt
with
he
arch-rival
,
another
marine
d
.
i
.
webb
march
over
to
the
table
,
get
up
in
she
face
and
say
,
''
just
what
kind
of
a
dame
do
you
think
you
be
?
''
bogart
he
be
not
.
the
other
d
.
i
.
get
one
of
the
few
memorable
non-webb
line
when
he
confess
to
the
girl
,
''
he
be
a
damn
good
d
.
i
.
...
i
guess
i
be
just
a
little
jealous
.
''
join
the
club
,
we
be
all
jealous
of
jack
webb
's
way
with
woman
,
which
be
showcase
even
more
amusingly
in
a
later
scene
,
as
webb
find
he
way
to
the
woman
's
place
of
employment
,
a
lingerie
store
,
and
stand
around
look
incredibly
fluster
at
the
negligee
on
display
.
''
you
expect
I
to
talk
to
you
...
in
_
here
_
?
!
''
he
exclaim
,
no
doubt
intimidate
by
the
barrage
of
bra
.
the
woman
go
off
to
help
a
customer
,
leave
webb
to
fend
for
himself
once
again
in
this
palace
of
estrogen
.
a
little
girl
spot
he
in
the
store
and
demand
,
''
what
be
you
do
in
here
...
you
be
a
man
,
be
not
you
?
''
he
do
not
reply
,
but
you
know
he
be
think
in
he
head
,
''
what
a
odd
species
of
human
--
so
small
.
must
be
one
of
those
child
everyone
's
be
talk
about
.
''
this
poor
girl
,
scar
for
life
by
she
early
encounter
with
jack
webb
,
would
later
swear
off
the
male
gender
entirely
,
just
one
of
the
many
lesbian
conversion
he
be
responsible
for
.
the
movie
do
not
focus
too
closely
on
webb
's
romance
,
it
also
continue
the
owen
subplot
with
probably
the
most
memorable
scene
in
the
entire
movie
,
where
webb
force
he
platoon
to
spend
the
entire
night
search
the
ground
for
a
flea
owen
kill
during
one
of
they
drill
.
after
two
private
hatch
a
scheme
to
present
webb
with
the
wrong
dead
flea
,
webb
ask
owen
,
''
be
that
flea
you
kill
a
male
or
female
?
''
owen
reply
,
''
a
male
,
sir
.
''
webb
yell
to
the
platoon
,
''
this
be
not
the
one
!
''
that
such
a
scene
-lrb-
along
with
the
rest
of
the
movie
-rrb-
be
intend
to
be
take
seriously
defy
comment
.
but
we
know
it
be
all
present
with
the
utmost
seriousness
when
a
title
card
at
the
end
thanks
the
marine
not
only
for
they
cooperation
in
the
making
of
the
d
.
i
.
,
but
for
iwo
jima
,
guadalcanal
and
every
other
major
battle
of
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
.
webb
hold
the
military
in
such
high
esteem
that
all
the
soldier
in
the
movie
-lrb-
with
the
exception
of
owen
-rrb-
be
play
by
actual
marine
.
someone
want
to
parody
this
movie
could
not
do
a
more
comical
job
than
webb
do
.
it
make
it
all
the
more
ironic
-lrb-
like
raeeyain
on
you
wedding
day
-rrb-
that
the
man
have
no
sense
of
humor
himself
.
there
be
a
scene
in
the
movie
where
the
guy
be
on
they
break
time
discuss
something
and
one
of
they
break
into
laughter
.
webb
burst
in
the
room
and
shout
,
''
what
do
i
tell
you
about
laugh
?
!
''
to
which
the
private
reply
,
''
sir
,
only
nine-year-old
girl
laugh
,
sir
!
''
and
let
I
tell
you
,
i
be
as
happy
as
a
nine-year

old
girl
while
watch
this
movie
