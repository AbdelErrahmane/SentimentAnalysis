contain
graphic
nudity
,
profanity
,
sexual
situation
and
violence
.
some
people
,
however
,
keep
they
clothes
on
.
you
do
not
watch
porn
film
for
they
intellectual
value
,
nor
do
you
write
review
on
they
.
that
be
why
this
review
will
be
short
.
it
seem
that
this
film
will
end
up
in
the
porn
section
when
it
hit
the
video
store
.
there
be
no
story
,
script
,
point
or
act
.
only
naked
body
,
which
be
exactly
the
point
.
here
be
the
so
call
plot
:
nomus
,
the
23-year-old
with
a
dark
past
as
a
hooker
,
have
hitchhike
from
somewhere
back
east
to
perform
in
a
show
where
a
dancer
do
not
wear
much
more
than
a
light
coating
of
powder
and
a
big
,
fake
smile
.
no
one
be
twist
nomus
's
arm
.
no
one
be
hold
she
grandmother
hostage
.
she
want
to
do
this
.
and
that
be
what
she
be
do
till
the
end
credit
.
so
what
be
the
problem
then
?
what
be
the
point
?
what
be
the
film
about
?
be
there
anyone
whose
aspiration
could
inspire
less
sympathy
?
this
film
can
be
describe
in
one
sentence
:
obscene
level
of
incompetence
,
excessive
stupidity
in
the
story
line
,
gross
negligence
of
the
viewer
's
intelligence
,
a
prurient
interest
in
the
quick
buck
.
believe
I
,
after
a
hour
with
these
character
,
act
and
script
,
you
'll
start
hope
for
someone
to
kill
somebody
.
elizabeth
berkley
make
a
laughable
try
as
the
heroine
of
this
film
,
that
be
bad
even
for
eszterha
'
script
.
she
character
be
the
only
one
that
be
at
least
half
write
and
she
could
really
have
do
better
.
she
character
deny
the
fact
that
she
be
a
whore
for
the
industry
,
sell
she
body
to
the
hungry
eye
of
the
horny
public
.
''
i
be
not
a
whore
!
i
be
a
dancer
''
,
she
scream
,
but
do
it
in
such
a
over
dramatize
way
that
you
'll
start
laugh
.
in
fact
the
act
in
''
showgirl
''
bring
terrible
to
a
new
and
previously
unknown
level
.
not
one
single
achievement
,
besides
the
conventional
cinematography
,
be
worth
mention
.
it
be
a
total
waste
of
time
and
money
.
there
be
not
a
single
moment
of
what
you
might
call
intelligence
.
the
dialogue
be
structure
of
ancient
stereotype
and
cliche
line
up
one
after
another
.
its
attempt
to
even
imagine
to
have
half
a
brain
result
in
a
catastrophe
.

insert

line

even
the
only
decent
line

:

about
''
can
not
save
`

'
from
go
under
.
it
be
a
strange
phenomenon
.
it
be
not
erotic
,
because
it
lack
sensuality
.
not
dramatic
,
because
it
lack
the
act
.
and
not
intelligent
because
it
lack
a
story
.
it
be
simply
verhoven

bad
excuse

pornography
.
you
want
to
see
naked
woman
?
bare
breast
?
full
frontal
?
it
be
nothing
wrong
with
that
.
but
in
that
case
i
suggest
that
you
rent
a
porn
film
in
you
local
video
store
,
and
not
waste
time
survive
through
eszterha
'
pathetic
dialogue
.
b
quality
,
while
it
be
only
a
high
budget
porn-film
.
