star
kiefer
sutherland
;
reese
witherspoon
&
bokeem
woodbine
i
use
to
think
that
the
conversation
be
the
worse
film
i
have
ever
see
.
freeway
be
give
I
second
thought
.
freeway
be
a
modern
retelling
of
little
red
ride
hood
.
only
in
the
ninety
,
little
red
ride
hood
be
a
foul-mouthed
juvenile
delinquent
play
by
reese
witherspoon
,
and
the
big
bad
wolf
be
a
serial
killer
-lrb-
keifer
sutherland
-rrb-
.
to
top
that
pathetic
premise
off
--
reese
go
to
visit
granny
and
you
'll
never
guess
who
be
wait
under
the
cover
's
in
granny
's
bed
.
keifer
sutherland
be
one
of
hollywood
most
talented
,
yet
underrated
actor
,
and
reese
witherspoon
be
exceptionally
talented
and
will
most
likely
become
a
major
star
.
so
what
be
they
do
in
this
movie
?
after
see
the
end
result
,
undoubtedly
they
be
both
ask
themselves
the
same
question
.
you
might
be
ask
yourself
why
this
be
such
a
short
review
.
the
answer
be
quite
simple
--
i
dont
want
to
waste
any
more
of
my
time
write
or
think
about
this
movie
than
absolutely
necessary
.
i
waste
enough
of
my
time
just
sit
through
it
.
note
to
keifer
:
you
wonder
why
you
be
not
a
bigger
star
in
hollywood
?
because
you
keep
make
movie
like
this
.
note
to
reese
:
you
be
great
in
fear
,
what
happen
this
time
?
note
to
both
:
do
not
worry
about
it
too
much
,
no
one
see
this
movie
anyway
.
bottom
line
--
i
be
still
shake
my
head
.
do
not
waste
you
time
on
this
turkey
.
if
you
want
to
see
a
great
keifer
sutherland
movie
,
go
rent
flatliner
or
young
gun
.
reese
witherspoon
's
abundant
act
talent
be
use
to
they
full
potential
in
fear
,
a
great
thriller
.
do
yourself
a
favor
and
rent
one
of
these
movie
--
but
stay
as
far
away
from
freeway
as
you
possibly
can
.
