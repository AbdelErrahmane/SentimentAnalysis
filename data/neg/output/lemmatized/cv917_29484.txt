quite
the
cinematic
achievement
.
in
about
two
hour
,
we
get
a
glance
examination
of
ghetto
life
,
a
funeral
with
a
heartfelt
eulogy
,
speech
about
never
give
up
,
a
cache
of
cute
kid
-lrb-
include
a
fat
one
with
asthma
-rrb-
,
a
hard-luck
gambler
who
find
salvation
in
a
good
woman
and
a
climactic
''
big
game
,
''
where
the
underdog
prove
to
have
a
bigger
bite
than
anyone
ever
imagine
.
all
that
be
need
be
a
guy
get
hit
in
the
nut
and
a
food
fight
to
have
the
first
film
solely
base
on
cinematic
clich
?
s
.
i
can
not
wait
to
see
the
delete
scene
when
it
come
out
on
dvd
.
obviously
,
hardball
be
a
strikeout
of
a
movie
that
never
get
the
bat
anywhere
near
the
ball
.
it
star
keanu
reeve
as
the
aforementioned
gambler
,
who
seem
to
owe
every
bookie
in
chicago
a
amount
of
money
that
rival
the
gross
national
product
of
guam
.
out
of
solution
,
he
beg
he
successful
corporate
friend
-lrb-
the
always
welcome
mike
mcglone
-rrb-
to
lend
he
$
5
,
000
.
instead
,
mcglone
offer
reeve
the
chance
to
help
he
coach
a
youth
baseball
team
from
the
project
for
a
nice
weekly
stipend
.
reeve
,
who
want
to
keep
he
finger
,
accept
the
offer
,
but
discover
mcglone
be
only
too
happy
to
let
he
handle
the
team
entirely
.
the
drowsy-voiced
protagonist
must
teach
the
sassy
inner
city
kid
the
baseball
basics
in
a
life
of
absentee
parent
and
merciless
gang
.
and
maybe
,
just
maybe
,
they
'll
play
in
the
big
championship
game
.
one
of
the
glorious
surprise
in
the
screenplay
by
john
gatin
-lrb-
summer
catch
-rrb-
,
adapt
from
daniel
coyle
's
non-fiction
book
,
be
that
there
be
not
any
.
the
movie
coast
from
heartfelt
moment
to
heartfelt
moment
like
a
zombie
.
that
would
not
be
so
bad
,
if
the
character
have
a
ounce
of
subtlety
or
humanity
to
they
.
most
of
the
kid
'
time
be
spend
yell
at
each
other
,
talk
in
slang
and
act
surprised
.
there
be
little
that
be
naturally
amusing
about
they
,
as
they
all
seem
to
know
the
camera
be
roll
.
the
worst
of
the
lot
be
a
tough-talking
younger
player
-lrb-
dewayne
warren
-rrb-
whose
sole
purpose
,
as
the
movie
unfold
,
be
be
a
emotional
pawn
,
a
tactic
so
utterly
despicable
i
can
not
find
the
right
word
to
express
myself
.
the
adult
also
do
not
fare
well
.
reeve
be
impressively
uninspiring
as
the
down-on-his-luck
loser
.
the
character
be
poorly
write
,
but
reeve
give
another
charisma-free
performance
.
every
time
he
speak
,
he
sound
like
he
just
get
up
from
a
long
nap
and
be
gradually
wake
up
.
kid
be
suppose
to
rally
around
this
guy
?
diane
lane
,
who
co-star
as
reeve
'
obligatory
love
interest
,
remain
a
glowing
screen
presence
-lrb-
see
my
dog
skip
for
better
proof
-rrb-
.
it
be
too
bad
that
she
role
here
consist
of
utter
line
like
,
''
these
kid
trust
you
,
and
they
do
not
trust
anyone
!
''
then
there
be
d
.
b
.
sweeney
as
a
evil
rival
coach
and
john
hawke
as
reeve
'
scummy
bet
buddy
and
other
unoriginal
character
you
have
see
before
and
hope
never
to
see
again
.
i
want
hardball
to
be
good
.
robbin
'
varsity
blues
be
a
funny
and
alternately
taut
tale
of
texa
high
school
football
that
have
alus
larter
smother
in
whip
cream
and
jon
voight
sneer
at
everything
that
move
.
i
have
not
see
robbin
'
goofy
ready
to
rumble
in
its
entirety
,
but
i
be
intrigue
that
''
macho
man
''
randy
savage
and
martin
landau
can
exist
in
the
same
movie
without
there
be
serious
worldwide
repercussion
.
robbin
obviously
need
to
go
back
to
he
forte
--
make
sport
movie
for
guy
and
not
cutesy
,
cuddly
pap
such
as
hardball
,
which
also
manage
to
annoy
and
insult
the
audience
.
here
's
hope
that
happen
in
the
immediate
future
.
