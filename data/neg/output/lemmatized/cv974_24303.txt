long
ago
,
film
be
construct
of
strong
dialogue
,
original
character
,
memorable
plot
point
,
and
solid
acting
.
one
of
the
best
example
that
hollywood
now
completely
ignore
these
quality
be
find
in
the
new
film
where
the
heart
be
.
this
opus
about
the
power
of
love
and
the
redemption
of
family
follow
the
tragic
,
and
i
mean
tragic
,
life
of

natalie
portman
-rrb-
.
hit
the
road
with
she
hick
,
guitar-playing
boyfriend
in
a
rusted-out
gm
,
novalee
dream
of
the
blue
sky
of
bakersfield
and
sip
chocolate
milk
beneath
a
plastic
umbrella
with
she
unborn
baby
,
due
in
a
month
.
stop
off
at
a
nearby
wal-mart
for
a
quick
rest
,
novalee
's
boyfriend
decide
to
take
off
and
leave
she
there
.
novalee
then
decide
to
secretly
hole
up
in
the
wal-mart
-lrb-
because
she
be
not
the
brightest
bulb
in
the
stagelight
-rrb-
.
a
wacky
librarian
-lrb-
keith
david
-rrb-
come
to
she
rescue
when
she
go
into
labor
one
night
while
she
be
camp
in
the
outdoors
section
of
the
store
.
then
the
she
move
in
with
a
family
,
befriend
everyone
in
town
--
include
ashley
judd
's
character
-lrb-
who
have
five
kid
and
still
can
work
part-time
as
a
nurse
-rrb-
--
fight
off
religious
freak
,
survive
a
tornado
,
break
the
heart
of
the
wacky
librarian
that
save
she
,
receive
a
inheritance
,
build
a
martha
stewart-esque
house
,
become
a
award-winning
photographer
,
and
manage
to
always
look
like
she
step
out
of
a
cosmo
shoot
,
all
while
not
once
do
anything
with
she
kid
.
this
film
be
terrible
.
the
directing
be
awful
:
it
seem
director
matt
william
have
a
index
card
with
six
angle
write
on
it
and
use
every
one
of
they
,
over
and
over
and
over
again
.
we
get
pathetic
and
ugly
acting
by
natalie
portman
,
who
can
do
good
work
.
a
disjointed
pacing
of
key
scene
and
a
time
structure
so
confuse
that
it
would
throw
steve
prefontaine
off
.
a
subplot
that
actually
validate
the
action
of
the
boyfriend
who
abandon
novalee
in
the
wal-mart
parking
lot
.
a
embarrassing
display
of
emotion
by
the
character
,
make
the
audience
ill
.
take
two
great
comedic
screenwriter
,
babaloo
mandel
and
lowell
ganz
,
and
force
they
to
write
drama
on
par
with
oprah
's
book
club
.
altogether
,
it
have
the
feeling
of
be
trap
at
home
,
watch
a
very
bad
television
mini-series
and
wish
it
to
end
,
only
the
remote
be
break
.
however
,
the
main
problem
with
the
film
be
that
it
never
answer
the
most
poignant
question
bring
up
:
where
be
the
heart
?
no
one
ever
seem
to
find
it
in
this
piece
of
junk
.
