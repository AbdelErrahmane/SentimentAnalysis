yet
another
brainless
teen
flick
,
this
one
be
about
,
surprise
,
drug
and
sex
.
star
katie
holme
and
sarah
polly
could
not
look
more
bored
.
they
character
be
cardboard
cut-out
of
every
cliched
teenager
out
there
.
one
thing
you
need
to
know
be
i
really
hate
this
movie
.
everything
about
it
annoy
the
hell
out
of
I
.
the
act
,
and
script
,
the
plot
,
and
end
.
the
director
-lrb-
of
the
fluke
hit
swinger
-rrb-
could
have
very
well
direct
a
bunch
of
no-name
actor
and
have
a
watchabe
film
.
the
''
big
''
star
of
go
pretty
much
drown
the
project
of
any
originality
.
i
feel
like
i
be
watch
dawson
's
creek
episode
200
.
although
the
film
still
would
have
stay
at
red
despite
its
cast
.
the
''
surprise
''
end
be
sooo
predictable
.
since
when
be
a
male
character
's
sudden
outing
of
the
closet
consider
a
surprise
in
hollywood
anymore
?
?
go
be
dawson
's
creek
+
varsity
blues
-
she
be
all
that
=
go
home
and
watch
something
else
.
