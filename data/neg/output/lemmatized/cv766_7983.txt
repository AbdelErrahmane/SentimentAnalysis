have
never
think
that
a
entry
in
the
modern
incarnation

the

would
approach
this
level
of
campiness
,
but
in
many
instance
batman

near
,
and
at
some
point
even
exceed
this
standard
.
this
be
a
disasterously
bad
film
,
easily
the
worst
in
the
series
to
date

and
fairly
epitomize
a
cinematic
definition
of
the
word
excessive
-
it
be
loud

garish

obnoxious

with
pointless

gratuitous

clutter

akiva
goldsman
's
screenplay
for
the
film
be
ridiculous
and
laughably
bad
,
with
astonishingly
terrible
dialogue
,
lame
joke
,
and
a
awful
by-the-number
plot
which
simply
coast
along
and
fail
to
generate
any
genuine
excitement
.
it
make
goldsman
's
screenplay
of
batman
forever
,
which
i
thought
be
dreadful
,
look
positively
inspire
in
comparison
.
i
be
still
astonish
that
a
cheesy
plot
device
which
i
would
see
use
in
-
no
joke
-
a
episode
of
gilligan
's
island
somehow
make
its
way
into
a
multimillion
dollar
blockbuster
production
.
joel
schumacher
's
direction
of
batman
and
robin
be
horrific
,
with
a
terrible
balance
of
flashiness
over
substance
.
there
be
a
clear
conceit
towards
neon
in
this
film
,
even
moreso
than
with
he
previous
batman
forever
,
with
the
revamp
batcave
helpfully
sport
gigantic
glowing
emblem
for
the
dynamic
duo
-lrb-
just
in
case
,
i
suppose
,
if
they
ever
happen
to
forget
that
the
batcave
be
the
headquarters
of
batman
and
robin
-rrb-
,
and
with
neon
prominently
figure
in
a
utterly-pointless
fight
sequence
with
bane
and
a
street
gang
over
ivy
's
choose
new
abode
.
another
action
sequence
which
fail
to
serve
any
useful
point
other
than
to
chew
up
five
minute
of
screentime
involve
a
incredibly
uninvolving
late-night
motorcycle
race
with
barbara
and
some
gotham
goon
.
mr
.
schumacher
's
focus
for
batman
and
robin
appear
to
be
to
make
the
film
as
visually
striking
as
possible
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
story
-
there
be
drastic
shift
in
the
tone
of
the
film
between
all-out
camp
and
heartfelt
drama
,
with
the
latter
completely
unconvincing
and
ineffective
.
it
be
perhaps
not
the
most
promising
of
sign
when
the
group
i
be
with
burst
out
laugh
within
twenty
seconds
of
the
film
's
opening
,
even
before
a
single
line
of
dialogue
have
be
utter
.
be
batman
and
robin
suppose
to
be
campy
?
i
think
it
be
-
it
be
hard
to
imagine
that
the
filmmaker
could
have
intend
many
part
of
the
film
to
be
take
at
all
seriously
.
-lrb-
one
of
my
favorite
be
when
bane
helpfully
grunt
''
bomb
!
''
each
time
he
lay
down
a
explosive
device
in
the
gotham
observatory
.
-rrb-
be
it
suppose
to
be
as
overly
campy
as
it
turn
out
to
be
?
i
somehow
doubt
it
-
the
subplot
involve
afr
be
deliver
so
solemnly
and
with
such
graveness
that
the
impression
be
make
that
the
film
be
not
attempt
to
be
the
utter
farce
which
it
be
.
arnold
schwarzenegger
be
top-billed
in
the
film
as
the
villainous
mr
.
freeze
,
and
be
bland
and
uninteresting
,
perhaps
the
worst
thing
that
a
villain
can
be
.
mr
.
schwarzenegger
's
attempt
to
be
menacing
be
laughable
,
and
he
attempt
at
convey
pathos
be
laughable
;
frankly
,
everything
he
do
onscreen
be
laughable
.
by
the
end
of
the
film
,
i
be
stifle
a
chuckle
every
time
he
simply
appear
onscreen
.
the
bulk
of
he
performance
consist
of
utter
near-unintelligble
pun
and
one-liner
feature
every
possible
permutation
of
''
cool
!
''
in
the
least
inventive
way
.
george
clooney
have
be
give
very
little
to
do
in
batman
and
robin
,
be
overshadow
by
the
villain
,
and
consequently
he
look
rather
uncomfortable
in
the
film
.
he
batman
be
hardly
a
impose
figure
.
chris
o'donnell
be
unimpressive
in
a
one-note
performance
,
while
alicium
silverstone
lackadasically
fail
to
make
any
impression
at
all
.
the
film
's
one
save
grace
?
undoubtably
uma
thurman
's
entertaining
performance
as
sexy
villainess
poison
ivy
.
she
work
in
batman
and
robin
be
certainly
over-the-top
,
but
in
a
controlled
fashion
which
work
splendidly
within
the
tone
of
the
film
.
m
.
thurman
's
comic
timing
be
impeccable
,
and
remind
we
that
it
take
skilled
performer
to
make
campiness
work
successfully
.
-lrb-
i
be
already
start
to
positively
reassess
jim
carrey
's
performance
in
batman
forever
.
-rrb-
she
amusing
poison
ivy
be
the
most
entertaining
character
in
the
film
,
and
when
she
be
offscreen
the
film
greatly
suffer
.
i
figure
that
if
one
have
to
die
,
be
kiss
to
death
by
uma
thurman
be
not
a
half-bad
way
to
go
.
while
batman
and
robin
be
hardly
a
ride
of
pulse-pounding
excitement
,
i
must
admit
that
i
be
not
bore
watch
it
,
although
i
do
glance
at
my
watch
repeatedly
through
the
screening
-
my
attention
be
keep
through
anticipation
of
the
utterance
of
yet
another
terrible
pun
or
one-liner
,
and
by
await
yet
another
scene
to
fall
flat
.
it
be
be
a
long
time
since
i
have
laugh
so
much
at
a
movie
.
''
at
''
,
of
course
,
be
the
operative
word
.
