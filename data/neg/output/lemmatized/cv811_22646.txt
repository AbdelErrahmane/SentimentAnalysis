when
the
haunting
arrive
in
theater
,
all
i
keep
hear
about
be
the
overdo
special
effect
and
the
fact
that
very
often
the
unseen
bump
in
the
night
in
a
horror
film
be
far
scarier
than
those
that
you
can
put
a
face
to
courtesy
of
special
effect
.
while
i
agree
that
this
remake
of
the
haunting
go
a
bit
overboard
in
the
visual
effect
department
,
i
do
not
think
that
they
be
completely
to
blame
for
this
movie
's
failure
.
it
appear
that
some
people
have
fail
to
take
into
account
that
the
original
haunting
have
the
''
unseen
''
terror
,
and
it
be
about
as
scary
as
a
dust
bunny
.
so
special
effect
or
not
,
if
the
story
be
not
the
least
bit
scary
,
you
be
not
go
to
end
up
with
a
very
frightening
movie
.
the
thing
that
interest
I
most
about
this
movie
be
the
caretaker
of
this
building
play
by
bruce
dern
.
dern
be
always
great
,
and
even
though
he
may
have
have
only
about
3
minute
of
screen
time
he
be
still
the
most
interesting
element
of
the
movie
.
as
i
sit
through
the
seemingly
endless
,
albeit
fairly
impressive
,
special
effect
,
i
keep
wish
that
this
movie
be
about
dern
's
caretaker
and
not
the
one
dimensional
character
that
populate
the
cast
.
never
a
good
sign
when
a
bit
player
be
the
best
part
of
the
movie
.
liam
neeson
play
a
scientist
who
be
conduct
experiment
on
fear
.
he
decide
the
best
way
to
get
result
be
to
trick
a
group
of
fairly
unstable
individual
to
spend
a
few
day
in
a
haunt
mansion
.
he
trick
they
into
participate
by
let
on
that
he
be
conduct
a
experiment
on
insomnia
.
and
he
also
fail
to
mention
that
the
mansion
have
a
reputation
for
strange
goings-on
.
catherine
zeta-jone
,
lili
taylor
and
owen
wilson
play
he
subject
.
like
the
original
,
taylor
's
character
be
the
star
of
the
movie
.
but
since
she
do
not
quite
have
the
marquee
power
of
liam
neeson
and
m
.
zeta-jone
,
they
part
do
seem
to
be
a
big
larger
than
in
the
original
.
and
let
's
face
it
,
probably
half
the
people
who
see
this
movie
will
do
so
because
of
zeta-jone
.
i
'll
admit
that
i
would
have
never
see
this
thing
if
she
be
not
in
it
.
but
the
real
star
here
be
the
special
effect
combine
with
the
fairly
overdo
set
.
they
take
over
the
movie
as
the
supernatural
element
of
the
house
start
to
interact
with
we
hapless
insomnia
patient
.
there
really
be
not
much
of
a
story
here
.
just
endless
setup
so
director
jan
de
bont
can
showcase
all
the
nifty
special
effect
that
he
get
to
play
with
.
and
the
special
effect
be
great
.
in
many
case
they
be
as
good
as
you
be
likely
to
see
anywhere
.
in
other
case
they
be
overdo
and
obviously
throw
in
just
for
the
sake
of
hit
the
''
cool
shot
''
quota
.
at
no
point
in
the
movie
do
any
of
these
thing
ever
come
close
to
be
scary
--
funny
,
maybe
.
but
not
scary
.
then
we
have
the
set
.
when
i
first
see
the
house
,
i
be
very
impressed
with
the
very
cool
gothic
look
about
it
.
but
it
only
take
a
short
tour
by
the
character
around
the
place
to
see
that
the
set
designer
obviously
have
as
much
money
to
burn
as
the
visual
effect
people
do
,
and
decide
to
take
the
idiotically
overdo
route
.
this
include
a
flood
hallway
with
book
as
step
stone
and
a
mirror
circular
room
that
revolve
.
what
part
do
these
room
play
in
the
story
?
absolutely
none
.
they
be
just
there
to
take
we
mind
off
the
fact
that
there
be
neither
a
descent
story
nor
a
single
scare
in
the
entire
movie
.
then
we
have
the
actor
.
lili
taylor
have
never
be
one
of
my
favorite
.
and
when
the
fact
that
she
character
be
mousy
and
pathetic
be
factored
in
,
she
come
in
around
the
average
or
slightly
below
mark
.
i
have
no
idea
why
liam
neeson
take
this
role
.
he
basically
remind
I
of
the
ringmaster
at
a
out
of
control
circus
.
he
character
be
in
charge
of
this
farce
but
it
quickly
get
away
from
he
.
i
have
no
doubt
that
liam
will
want
to
lock
all
print
of
this
movie
in
a
very
secure
vault
along
with
all
copy
of
darkman
.
zeta-jone
be
cast
because
she
be
too
hot
for
word
.
the
fact
that
she
character
be
bi-sexual
be
just
icing
on
the
cake
.
all
catherine
have
to
do
in
this
movie
be
look
good
.
fortunately
that
be
something
she
do
very
well
.
while
she
do
have
a
fairly
good
size
part
,
it
be
obvious
that
she
only
purpose
in
the
movie
be
as
eye-candy
.
it
be
too
bad
someone
of
she
talent
waste
they
here
.
any
random
supermodel
pull
out
of
a
fashion
show
could
have
easily
fill
she
role
.
the
haunting
be
the
antithesis
of
another
of
1999
's
horror
movie
,
the
blair
witch
project
.
the
haunting
have
a
seemingly
limitless
effect
budget
,
while
blair
witch
rely
on
pile
of
rock
for
its
scare
.
both
prove
quite
nicely
that
special
effect
be
irrelevant
to
a
horror
film
.
if
the
story
suck
,
it
be
all
downhill
from
there
.
my
advice
?
if
you
be
look
for
special
effect
,
go
rent
star
war
.
if
it
be
scare
you
want
,
rent
halloween
.
either
way
,
it
be
probably
in
you
best
interest
to
skip
the
haunting
.
