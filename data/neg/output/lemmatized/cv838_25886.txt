in
we
time
.
in
we
modern
world
,
where
the
cool
rule
,
it
be
hard
to
imagine
that
shakespeare
be
become
`
the
man
'
.
and
yet
-
film
after
film
,
after
film
,
be
base
on
he
everlasting
magic
.
in
warner
brother
'
latest
production
,
shakespeare
be
kick
ass
to
a
rap
beat
,
while
he
magic
and
intelligence
slowly
fade
away
.
though
the
producer
of
the
matrix
have
vaguely
base
they
picture
on
william
shakespeare
's
`
romeo
and
juliet
'
,
its
title
sequence
with
a
frightening
rap
song
and
a
black
limo
make
its
way
through
the
dark
street
of
new
york
,
be
very
hard
to
associate
with
shakespeare
's
poetry
.
the
film
take
place
during
a
silent
war
between
the
two
major
mafia
family
in
the
city
-
the
afro
american
against
the
chinese
.
the
youngest
son
of
a
chinese
mafia
chieftain
be
find
murder
.
the
afro-american
be
immediately
suspect
,
but
a
peace
treaty
be
sign
between
the
two
godfather
.
it
be
at
this
point
that
han
-lrb-
the
romeo
of
the
story
-rrb-
find
out
about
he
brother
's
death
.
escape
from
a
prison
in
china
,
he
return
to
united
state
to
avenge
he
brother
's
fate
.
but
before
he
can
restore
justice
with
he
kung
fu
kick
,
he
fall
in
love
with
a
mysterious
beauty
.
the
only
problem
be
that
she
be
the
daughter
of
he
enemy
.
.
there
be
only
a
weak
echo
of
shakespeare
's
talent
in
this
disappointing
production
.
and
there
be
more
problem
besides
its
title
.
of
course
we
do
not
call
it
a
deformation
of
a
great
masterpiece
.
we
call
it
`
modernization
'
.
it
seem
that
the
producer
fear
that
the
audience
will
not
respond
to
lyric
,
without
any
car
chase
and
gun
fight
.
this
lack
of
respect
for
the
audience
i
find
very
disturbing
.
kenneth
brannagh
have
already
prove
that
shakespeare
do
not
need
to
be
update
,
because
he
tale
be
ground
in
the
basics
of
life
and
human
nature
.
and
as
long
as
love
,
hate
,
honesty
and
corruption
do
exist
,
everyone
will
understand
and
embrace
shakespeare
.
i
must
admit
that
i
find
`
rome
must
die
'
very
confusing
.
i
can
forgive
andrzej
bartkowiak
,
since
it
be
he
first
attempt
at
direct
.
he
manage
to
create
a
incredible
atmosphere
and
direct
with
a
firm
precision
.
unfortunately
he
completely
forget
about
character
-
and
story
development
.
he
latest
picture
be
therefore
visually
impressive
,
but
intellectually
hollow
.
the
love
story
between
han
-lrb-
jet
li
-rrb-
and
trish
-lrb-
aalyah
-rrb-
,
and
the
mafia
intrigue
be
undeveloped
and
simplify
.
jet
li
be
one
of
the
most
amazing
fighter
to
ever
hit
the
silver
screen
and
aalyah
have
a
magical
voice
.
they
achievement
save
this
film
from
be
completely
braindead
,
but
they
be
not
actor
,
and
therefore
can
not
act
.
they
be
nothing
more
than
two
celebrity
put
together
.
the
other
actor
,
include
isaiah
washington
,
russell
wong
,
henry
o
and
dmx
all
give
the
standard
mediocre
performance
.
delroy
lindo
be
the
only
one
that
project
a
coherent
image
of
reality
.
but
there
be
more
than
act
to
worry
about
.
even
with
li
's
incredible
skill
in
martial
art
,
the
action
scene
-lrb-
though
technically
excellent
-rrb-
be
too
long
and
story
update
simply
embarrassing
.
to
make
a
long
story
short
:
`
romeo
must
die
'
be
not
intelligent
enough
to
be
a
thriller
,
not
sensual
enough
to
be
a
love
story
and
too
serious
to
be
a
fun
action
film
.
it
be
certain
that
bartkowiak
would
be
much
better
off
with
o
this
embarrassing
and
completely
unnecessary
parallel
to
`
romeo
and
juliet
'
,
so
the
film
be
completely
stick
-
not
sure
of
what
to
be
.
and
in
the
end
it
be
nothing
.
there
be
no
performance
worthy
of
notice
,
no
interesting
character
-
or
story
surprise
.
so
again
,
the
only
good
thing
about
it
be
its
technical
achievement
.
this
film
can
boast
of
great
sound
,
fast
paced
editing
,
solid
cinematography
and
some
very
well
coordinate
action
sequence
.
the
music
be
another
factor
that
prevent
you
from
leave
the
theater
.
it
be
mostly
provide
by
aalyah
's
enchanting
voice
and
several
carefully
insert
rap
song
by
various
artist
,
that
create
a
kind
of
`
ghetto
feel
'
to
it
.
but
when
i
think
back
,
it
be
not
much
i
remember
from
this
`
production
'
.
as
in
almost
every
summer
movie
,
there
be
some
interesting
scene
,
but
most
of
the
moment
that
i
remember
be
associate
with
massive
special
effect
.
it
be
not
a
film
that
will
get
any
attention
for
its
artistic
quality
,
simply
because
it
do
not
have
any
.
for
someone
who
have
never
read
shakespeare
,
it
be
another
popcorn
film
.
for
those
of
we
who
have
,
it
be
a
waste
of
money
,
time
and
brain
cell
.
