and
just
when
you
think
joblo
be
get
a
little
soft
around
the
corner
,
not
rating
anything
lower
than
you
standard
''
this
movie
suck
''
,
along
come
this
cinematic
atrocity
and
he
be
force
to
take
out
he
secret
weapon
and
spray
it
with
a
stench
so
thick
,
even
the
bravest
movie-goer
would
think
twice
about
see
this
waste
of
time
.
yes
,
despite
be
a
third
sequel
to
a
successful
original
movie
,
the
latest
highlander
do
not
seem
to
have
anything
go
for
it
.
oh
stinky
movie
,
let
I
count
thee
way
...
plot
:
-lrb-
from
what
i
understand
-rrb-
a
really
bad
highlander
dude
come
to
the
present
look
to
whack
out
the
nice
highlander
dude
in
order
to
gain
they
power
and
become
the
mightiest
immortal
...
or
something
along
those
line
.
critique
:
a
complete
and
utter
mess
.
disjointed
,
incoherent
,
boring
,
corny
,
fill
with
bad
dialogue
...
and
that
be
just
the
first
thirty
minute
!
this
film
do
not
seem
to
know
what
to
do
with
itself
.
it
be
confuse
to
anyone
who
do
not
know
the
series
-lrb-
i
include
myself
in
that
group
-rrb-
and
apparently
idiotic
to
those
who
do
know
the
series
-lrb-
i
include
die-hard
highlander
fan
the
arrow
in
that
group
-rrb-
.
the
film
do
not
explain
anything
about
itself
...
it
just
go
from
one
inexplicable
situation
to
another
.
one
moment
they
be
in
the
present
time
,
the
next
moment
,
they
be
in
italy
in
the
1600
.
why
?
who
know
.
what
be
they
talk
about
?
no
idea
.
flashback
mix
in
with
the
present
,
mixed
in
with
a
few
spontaneously
cheesy
fight
sequence
every
now
and
again
,
and
i
even
remember
see
one
flashback
scene
which
go
even
further
into
its
own
flashback
scene
!
!
hullo
...
?
!
?
confuse
yet
?
i
be
and
i
basically
stop
give
a
crap
about
anyone
in
the
film
when
i
realize
that
neither
the
writer
or
director
be
interested
in
present
I
with
any
kind
of
semblance
of
a
story
.
random
swordplay
,
mad
max-like
dude
show
up
in
motorcycle
in
the
1800s
?
or
be
they
in
the
present
at
that
time
?
who
know
...
and
to
be
honest
...
who
seriously
care
!
this
series
should
have
be
shoot
in
the
head
and
put
out
of
its
own
misery
a
long
time
ago
,
but
sadly
,
someone
at
the
studio
decide
that
it
still
have
a
little
life
leave
in
it
.
please
,
please
...
for
the
love
of
god
and
all
that
be
holy
in
the
world
of
movie-making
,
and
mostly
out
of
respect
for
those
who
love
the
original
film
,
put
this
series
to
bed
and
end
it
!
even
christopher
lambert
know
enough
to
play
second
fiddle
to
adrian
paul
in
this
one
.
the
director
also
try
to
do
the
best
he
can
with
the
muddle
material
,
but
all
he
could
come
up
with
be
plenty
of
slo-mo
action
,
some
fast-motion
fight
scene
and
lot
of
smoke
everywhere
.
and
be
there
anything
spectacular
about
the
sword-play
or
fight
scene
?
nope
.
and
i
think
we
all
could
have
do
without
all
those
zoom
lambert
face
close-up
...
yipe
,
the
man
be
not
age
gracefully
,
be
he
?
oh
boy
,
and
i
have
not
even
get
around
to
the
greatest
piece
of
over-act
that
i
have
see
in
year
.
the
man
who
play
kell
in
this
movie
,
bruce
payne
,
should
get
a
ham
trophy
for
literally
chew
up
every
piece
of
scenery
that
he
get
near
.
overacting
be
not
a
hobby
for
this
guy
...
it
be
a
living
!
he
be
also
very
funny
,
not
purposely
though
.
all
in
all
,
the
movie
stink
.
nuff
say
.
