''
easely
one
of
the
worst
film
of
the
year
.
.
''
with
the
millenium
just
around
the
corner
,
hollywood
be
play
with
we
insecurity
concern
the
biggest
event
of
this
century
.
this
time
it
be
arnold
schwartzenegger
against
the
power
of
evil
.
the
result
be
somewhat
predictable
.
i
do
not
have
high
hope
about
arnold
's
''
much
anticipate
''
return
to
the
big
screen
.
schwarzenegger
fan
will
probably
be
pleased
,
action
lover
will
not
be
bore
,
and
the
catholic
league
will
be
angry
.
everyone
else
will
see
`
end
of
day
'
for
what
it
be
:
a
deliciously
bad
motion
picture
.
think
of
it
as
hollywood
's
own
y2k
bug
.
do
you
know
that
if
you
turn
the
three
diabolical
number
666
you
'll
get
999
,
as
in
1999
?
yes
,
you
better
believe
it
.
.
satan
be
here
on
earth
,
work
on
he
latest
project
--
the
end
of
day
.
this
time
it
be
gabriel
burne
who
get
the
privilege
to
play
lucifer
and
,
although
not
al
pacino
,
he
be
fun
to
behold
.
he
coolly
stroll
through
manhattan
in
the
borrow
body
of
a
investment
banker
,
wreak
,
as
they
say
,
havoc
.
the
way
it
work
be
he
smirk
and
something
explode
.
before
the
stroke
of
the
new
millennium
he
be
get
to
find
and
impregnate
a
certain
woman
in
order
to
climb
out
from
under
a
heavenly
curse
as
spell
out
in
the
book
of
revelation
.
only
schwarzenegger
's
cop
attach
to
a
anti-terrorist
unit
can
stop
he
.
film
like
this
have
one
serious
weakness
--
logic
.
no
matter
how
you
twist
the
''
plot
''
,
you
'll
find
it
incredibly
stupid
-lrb-
even
for
a
schwartzenegger
movie
!
-rrb-
.
the
incredible
fact
be
that
such
director
never
learn
.
after
thousand
of
headless
production
,
this
theme
have
become
one
big
clich
?
.
here
the
devil
look
more
like
a
sex
addict
maniac
that
have
just
get
out
of
a
mental
institution
.
he
be
walk
around
n
.
y
.
,
blow
everything
up
and
kill
everyone
that
get
in
a
5
meter
radius
.
all
he
want
be
the
girl
,
that
be
somehow
special
.
but
schwartzenegger
be
more
clever
than
he
look
,
he
have
hide
she
in
a
church
,
where
satan
dare
not
enter
.
so
the
evil
one
be
force
to
seduce
the
good
cop
in
order
to
get
the
valuable
information
:
''
you
can
have
you
wife
and
daughter
back
.
.
i
can
give
you
happiness
that
you
can
only
dream
of
.
.
just
give
I
the
address
.
.
''
indeed
with
a
script
like
that
,
you
could
make
a
wonderful
parody
,
but
unfortunately
the
director
be
take
this
subject
very
seriously
,
attempt
to
create
a
provoke
a
dramatic
thriller
.
and
for
you
who
have
await
arnold
swartzenegger
's
comeback
,
will
not
be
very
satisfied
.
we
have
not
see
he
in
a
while
.
that
be
because
he
do
not
have
a
worthy
opponent
.
he
have
battle
nuclear
terrorist
on
earth
and
power
mad
conspirator
on
mar
.
he
have
take
on
alien
predator
in
the
darkest
reach
of
the
jungle
and
morph
cyberkiller
that
seemingly
nothing
can
stop
.
so
,
after
all
those
fight
,
what
be
leave
for
arnold
schwarzenegger
?
how
about
satan
?
in
my
opinion
,
he
have
never
quite
overcome
he
first
role
as
the
deadly
robot
in
cameron
's
''
terminator
''
.
and
that
be
schwartzenegger
's
strength
--
muscle
and
no
emotion
.
here
he
try
to
achieve
a
artistic
level
,
move
towards
the
oscar
.
this
be
call
''
a
adult
turn
''
if
successful
and
''
a
flop
''
if
unsuccessful
.
make
a
wild
guess
!
he
character
have
lose
he
wife
and
daughter
and
have
serious
drinking
problem
.
this
require
at
least
some
act
skill
.
regrettably
,
the
only
thing
convince
about
old
arnold
be
he
muscle
.
the
rest
of
the
cast
be
struggle
with
they
so
call
character
.
the
movie
be
otherwise
technically
impressive
,
with
a
solid
cinematography
and
fine
lighting
.
but
the
movie
do
not
serve
neither
as
a
serious
thriller
-lrb-
because
of
its
stupidity
-rrb-
nor
as
comic
entertainment
-lrb-
because
of
its
serious
tone
-rrb-
.
the
only
real
comic
relief
in
this
film
be
when
swartzenegger
try
to
cry
.
the
action
sequence
be
all
recycled
and
the
effect
be
everything
but
spectacular
.
so
i
really
have
a
hard
time
recommend
this
film
to
somebody
.
unless
you
be
a
die-hard
schwartzenegger
fan
,
stay
away
.
as
for
schwarzenegger
,
he
'll
be
back
.
