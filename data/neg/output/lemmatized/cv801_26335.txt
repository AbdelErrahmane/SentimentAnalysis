yurus
zeltser
,
author
of
this
film
,
be
obviously
inspire
by
hitchcock
's
psycho
,
but
he
choose
to
add
some
new
and
potentially
interesting
element
to
the
original
plot
.
instead
of
norman
bate
we
have
two
brother
-
one
of
they
traumatise
physically
,
another
mentally
.
sexual
tension
between
beautiful
female
patron
and
shy
motel
clerk
be
heighten
with
the
presence
of
alcoholic
husband
.
eye
of
the
storm
be
impressive
in
visual
sense
,
with
photography
by
karl
walter
lindenlaub
provide
a
lot
of
claustrophobic
atmosphere
.
the
acting
be
fine
-
hopper
,
gregg
and
boyle
be
comfortable
with
they
role
,
but
sheffer
at
time
overact
he
psycho
routine
.
unfortunately
,
eye
of
the
storm
,
which
be
suppose
to
be
intense
psychological
drama
,
deteriorate
into
cheap
and
predictable
slasher
flick
during
melodramatic
finale
.
in
the
end
,
this
film
remind
we
that
original
approach
can
not
prevent
filmmaker
from
waste
too
many
opportunity
.
