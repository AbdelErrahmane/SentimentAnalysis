disney
's
''
air
bud
''
tell
a
boy-and-his-dog
story
with
a
twist
--
the
pooch
be
quite
a
accomplished
basketball
player
.
grant
,
for
a
family
comedy
,
it
be
not
a
very
funny
or
successful
idea
to
begin
with
,
but
it
do
not
seem
to
matter
--
''
air
bud
''
be
surprisingly
solemn
.
save
for
occasional
moment
of
forced
slapstick
,
the
movie
wag
its
tale
with
a
straight
face
--
not
a
very
enjoyable
approach
.
if
''
air
bud
''
have
realize
its
own
absurdity
,
then
it
possibly
could
have
be
better
.
here
,
we
be
actually
ask
to
cheer
a
moment
when
the
dog
march
out
to
save
the
big
game
,
clothe
in
two
pair
of
sneaker
and
even
a
jersey
.
its
number
?
k9
.
yeah
,
whatever
.
the
movie
open
as
golden
retriever
buddy
-lrb-
as
himself
-rrb-
escape
from
he
current
owner
,
abusive
clown-for-hire
norm
snively
-lrb-
michael
jeter
-rrb-
.
he
end
up
in
fernwell
,
washington
,
where
mopey
new-kid-on-the-block
josh
-lrb-
kevin
zeger
-rrb-
be
try
to
cope
with
the
move
and
the
recent
death
of
he
father
.
buddy
,
kevin
.
kevin
,
buddy
.
once
the
dog
prove
he
on-court
prowess
,
kevin
's
self-esteem
rocket
.
they
both
win
place
in
the
school
's
basketball
team
,
with
the
animal
as
they
mascot
.
but
before
they
can
make
it
to
the
final
,
snively
surface
to
reclaim
buddy
.
everything
play
out
just
as
one
would
think
:
heavy
on
predictability
,
light
on
a
actual
story
.
the
movie
follow
a
calculated
chain
of
event
--
kevin
's
gloom
fade
,
snively
get
he
comeuppance
and
buddy
contract
rabies
and
must
be
execute
old
yeller-style
.
okay
,
that
last
one
's
a
lie
,
but
at
least
it
would
have
be
a
quicker
send-off
than
''
air
bud
''
's
courtroom
climax
--
no
joke
!
there
be
even
a
faux-cute
musical
montage
where
a
reluctant
buddy
get
cleaned-up
to
''
splish
splash
.
''
paint
can
be
spill
and
newspaper
be
bury
,
all
in
the
name
of
formulum
.
the
end
credit
note
that
''
no
special
visual
effect
be
use
in
the
basketball
sequence
of
this
motion
picture
.
''
that
very
well
may
be
true
,
and
although
to
see
a
dog
sink
shot
be
quite
a
sight
,
a
movie
can
not
exist
on
feat
alone
.
but
''
air
bud
''
do
not
seem
to
be
interested
in
anything
else
.
a
friend
of
mine
insist
he
see
buddy
a
while
back
on
a
segment
of
david
letterman
's
''
stupid
pet
trick
.
''
i
can
not
think
of
a
more
appropriate
connection
--
this
movie
be
a
stupid
pet
trick
.
