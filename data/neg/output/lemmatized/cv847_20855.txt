the
preview
for
the
movie
be
pretty
good
.
they
show
a
little
plot
,
all
the
character
,
and
the
emotional
highlight
,
all
splice
together
to
give
a
general
impression
of
the
script
.
unfortunately
,
the
full
movie
add
nothing
but
115
minute
.
the
resident
of
mystery
love
hockey
.
mystery
and
hockey
go
together
like
texa
and
high
school
football
.
the
townsfolk
love
hockey
so
much
that
they
even
acquit
a
player
who
be
guilty
of
shoot
another
man
-lrb-
yes
,
that
be
one
of
the
movie
's
joke
.
-rrb-
every
Saturday
,
the
best
player
pair
off
for
a
game
,
and
the
whole
town
come
to
watch
.
the
town
's
prodigal
son
charlie
-lrb-
hank
azarium
-rrb-
write
a
article
on
the
weekly
game
for
sport
illustrate
.
mystery
's
national
fame
have
the
town
abuzz
.
a
week
later
,
charlie
actually
show
up
in
person
,
and
he
bring
with
he
a
offer
from
the
nhl
.
the
new
york
ranger
will
come
to
mystery
to
play
the
local
.
the
mysterian
see
this
as
both
good
and
bad
.
on
the
one
hand
,
they
would
love
to
have
the
fame
and
the
money
of
such
a
exhibition
.
on
the
other
hand
,
they
do
not
want
to
turn
up
as
the
butt
of
leno
and
letterman
joke
.
the
movie
follow
a
handful
of
life
that
be
affect
by
the
proposition
.
biebe
-lrb-
russell
crowe
-rrb-
have
just
be
retire
from
the
team
and
be
ask
to
coach
the
boy
,
include
he
new
replacement
.
he
be
already
resentful
,
and
to
top
it
off
charlie
have
be
make
eye
at
he
wife
.
crowe
be
not
give
a
lot
of
room
to
act
in
this
film
,
so
he
be
just
kind
of
stick
with
constantly
brooding
.
charlie
,
meanwhile
,
be
resentful
of
have
bear
in
a
town
where
hockey
be
the
only
measure
of
a
man
's
worth
.
he
''
gift
''
of
the
feature
story
,
and
of
the
new
york
ranger
,
be
he
way
of
compensate
for
not
be
a
better
skater
.
he
hope
it
would
earn
he
some
respect
and
merit
,
but
the
townspeople
find
reason
to
continue
dislike
he
.
burt
reynold
could
have
be
interesting
as
walter
,
the
judge
whose
courtroom
be
befoul
by
a
moronic
jury
of
hockey
fan
.
walter
actually
have
some
experience
with
collegiate
hockey
,
but
he
actively
try
to
put
it
behind
he
.
he
want
he
son
to
take
the
game
more
seriously
,
but
he
want
he
community
to
just
get
over
it
.
reynold
could
have
be
good
,
but
sloppy
writing
and\/or
editing
keep
walter
in
the
corner
,
and
so
reynolds
never
really
get
to
pull
he
performance
all
together
.
one
character
actually
be
interesting
.
biebe
's
wife
-lrb-
mary
mccormack
-rrb-
,
like
the
judge
,
understand
that
there
be
more
to
life
than
hockey
.
but
unlike
he
she
have
come
to
accept
the
skewed
view
of
the
community
.
she
choose
the
town
and
she
husband
with
she
eye
wide
open
.
she
unique
insight
be
verbalize
once
,
and
it
last
only
a
scene
before
it
be
go
,
but
she
performance
carry
the
hint
of
some
deeper
wisdom
.
mysterty
,
alaska
follow
a
handful
of
other
character
,
but
none
be
well
develop
or
worth
mention
.
the
biggest
problem
with
this
movie
be
that
there
be
no
real
heart
to
the
story
,
no
underlying
thing
that
the
movie
be
really
about
.
instead
,
roach
and
screenwriter
david
e
.
kelley
and
sean
o'byrne
try
to
cram
the
entire
human
condition
into
this
sport
comedy
.
they
try
to
make
you
laugh
and
cry
,
to
feel
outrage
and
pride
.
they
present
the
framing
and
cadence
for
joke
,
but
there
be
nothing
truly
funny
.
they
show
appropriately
stage
scene
of
sadness
,
but
they
give
you
nothing
to
be
really
sad
about
.
as
columnist
molly
ivin
would
say
,
it
be
all
hat
,
no
cattle
.
the
perfect
opportunity
arise
for
roach
to
say
what
this
movie
be
really
about
.
there
be
a
funeral
scene
,
play
with
appropriate
gravity
and
somber
music
.
it
be
a
chance
for
the
character
to
reflect
on
they
life
and
decide
what
be
truly
important
.
russell
crowe
step
forward
to
speak
,
about
to
spell
out
the
movie
's
metaphor
for
we
.
he
say
that
what
really
matter
in
life
be
''
community
...
''
then
add
''
and
hockey
.
''
i
guess
these
mysterian
really
be
as
shallow
as
they
appear
.
only
mildly
bad
,
mystery
,
alaska
probably
deserve
2
star
.
i
even
laugh
out
loud
,
genuine
laugh
in
place
.
but
i
docked
it
a
extra
half
star
when
mike
myer
,
a
friend
of
roach
,
turn
up
in
a
role
that
do
not
suit
he
.
myer
be
a
comic
character
actor
.
he
put
on
mask
,
become
a
outrageous
caricature
,
and
be
funny
.
he
be
great
as
austin
power
,
dr
.
evil
,
or
any
of
he
scottish
character
.
nobody
else
in
mysterty
,
alaska
be
a
comic
caricature
.
all
the
other
people
have
the
feel
of
dramatic
character
in
semi-serious
role
.
for
roach
to
bring
in
myer
for
a
few
cheap
laugh
show
incredible
contempt
toward
the
rest
of
he
cast
,
toward
he
audience
,
and
indeed
toward
the
film
itself
.
it
be
a
acknowledgment
by
the
director
that
the
film
be
not
worth
take
seriously
.
