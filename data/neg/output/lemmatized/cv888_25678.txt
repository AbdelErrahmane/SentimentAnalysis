-rrb-
receive
a
new
mercedes
for
a
graduation
present
.
he
and
he
buddy
take
it
for
a
joyride
to
a
small
nearby
town
,
where
he
proceed
to
torment
the
local
simply
because
he
be
rich
and
they
be
not
.
he
end
up
provoke
jasper
-lrb-
josh
hartnett
-rrb-
into
a
race
and
as
a
result
,
the
local
gas
station
and
diner
be
destroy
when
they
crash
into
it
.
kelley
be
sentence
to
rebuild
the
diner
,
and
have
to
live
with
jasper
in
a
spare
room
over
he
family
's
barn
.
jasper
's
girlfriend
sam
-lrb-
leelee
sobieskus
-rrb-
soon
take
a
liking
to
kelley
however
,
despite
the
fact
that
1
-rrb-
it
be
she
family
's
diner
that
be
destroy
and
b
-rrb-
all
kelley
do
be
sit
around
,
sulk
,
and
smart
off
to
the
townspeople
.
but
when
she
see
he
sweaty
and
shirtless
,
that
be
apparently
all
she
need
to
lose
she
feeling
for
jasper
-lrb-
whose
only
fault
seem
to
be
a
perpetual
case
of
hat
hair
-rrb-
.
so
sobieski
soon
fall
in
love
with
kelley
,
especially
after
the
day
she
follow
he
through
the
wood
and
hear
he
give
he
graduation
speech
-lrb-
which
he
be
unable
to
deliver
because
he
cause
the
destruction
of
property
and
nearly
kill
dozen
of
people
-rrb-
.
in
the
speech
,
kelley
quote
a
poem
by
robert
frost
,
which
just
so
happen
to
be
sam
's
favorite
poem
as
well
.
awwwww
.
soon
they
be
frolic
around
in
the
field
and
for
some
reason
waste
no
time
let
people
in
town
-lrb-
especially
jasper
's
best
friend
-rrb-
see
they
together
.
kelley
continue
to
make
a
ass
of
himself
in
town
,
especially
when
he
show
up
at
the
town
dance
,
drunk
and
steam
because
sam
go
with
jasper
.
kelley
run
off
and
decide
to
leave
town
.
sam
catch
up
to
he
at
the
bus
station
and
he
ask
she
to
come
to
boston
with
he
.
jasper
show
up
and
tearfully
confess
to
sam
just
how
much
he
love
she
,
and
sam
,
without
even
break
stride
basically
say
''
see
ya
!
''
and
take
off
to
boston
with
kelley
.
here
on
earth
go
in
so
many
wrong
direction
from
the
start
that
by
the
time
its
fairly
decent
end
come
around
,
its
completely
worthless
.
chri
klein
and
leelee
sobieskus
be
two
of
my
current
favorite
young
performer
,
and
it
be
because
of
they
presence
that
i
watch
this
film
in
the
first
place
.
however
,
not
long
into
the
proceedings
i
want
to
just
reach
into
the
film
and
strangle
they
both
.
i
should
not
have
such
feeling
towards
people
i
like
,
but
they
character
be
so
infuriating
that
...
well
trust
I
,
you
'll
feel
the
same
way
.
even
though
both
of
the
lead
male
character
be
usually
in
the
wrong
,
kelley
be
hand
down
the
more
unlikable
of
the
two
,
simply
because
he
jerkish
action
be
calculate
.
he
intend
to
be
a
jackass
each
and
every
time
he
do
it
.
jasper
on
the
other
hand
,
only
react
to
kelley
's
provocation
,
and
afterwards
come
across
as
be
truly
sorry
for
he
impulsive
action
.
but
,
as
in
life
,
nice
guy
finish
last
.
for
the
entire
film
we
watch
sam
fall
in
love
with
the
guy
no
one
like
while
the
film
's
only
sympathetic
character
get
completely
crush
.
then
,
a
cancer
subplot
come
into
play
-lrb-
where
thing
get
even
more
infuriating
,
if
you
can
imagine
that
-rrb-
.
what
,
thing
be
not
depress
enough
for
you
mr
.
screenwriter
?
who
greenlit
this
project
?
who
''
on
earth
''
think
this
would
entertain
anyone
?
perhaps
if
the
film
have
be
structure
where
kelley
perhaps
feel
some
remorse
after
he
cause
the
destruction
of
property
and
nearly
kill
dozen
of
people
.
but
even
after
he
be
destroy
these
people
's
life
he
continue
to
be
a
snob
to
they
,
and
ruin
one
more
for
good
measure
.
