on
he
first
ever
script

,
everyone
and
they
grandma
say
''

my
question
be
...
do
anyone

this
stupid
script
?
?
?
plot
:
ace
student
leigh
ann
watson
be
mistakenly
catch
with
some
cheating
papers
by
the
bitchiest
teacher
in
the
west
,
mr
.
tingle
,
and
set
to
lose
she
scholarship
to
college
.
when
she
and
she
friend
visit
the

in
order
to
explain
they
side
of
the
story
,
they
end
up
tie
she
up
,
and
slowly
try
to
talk
some
sense
into
the
hardheaded
woman
.
critique
:
it
be
not
so
much
that
this
be
a
bad
movie
,
than
the
fact
that
it
suck
.
this
movie
be
chock-full
of
one-dimensional
character
,
contain
no
actual
humor
that
i
be
able
to
zone
in
on
,
zero
tension
or
thrill
,
plot
hole
the
size
of
my
big
ass
,
lame
pop
tune
play
to
mask
nothing
go
on
in
the
movie
,
and
molly
ringwald
,
vivica
a
.
fox
and
lesley
anne
warren
toss
away
in
throwaway
role
.
i
be
prime
for
this
film
as
its
interesting
premise
have
I
think
misery
-lrb-
8\/10
-rrb-
and
9
to
5
,
but
unfortunately
for
williamson
,
he
go
nowhere
with
the
bright
foundation
,
make
reference
to
the
exorcist
and
dr
.
zhivago
,
which
i
doubt
many
in
he
target
market
will
appreciate
.
he
also
forget
about
suspense
,
with
all
of
he
character
base
on
incomprehensible
decision
,
unbelievable
motivation
and
simply
bore
we
with
all
of
they
trite
dialogue
.
sure
,
katie
holme
be
cute
,
and
she
co-star
,
marisa
coughlan
,
do
a
reasonably
amusing
impression
of
the
exorcist
-lrb-
worth
two
point
out
of
my
three
on
ten
-rrb-
,
but
how
can
we
forgive
the
biggest
one-dimensional
character
in
any
film
,
holme
'
rival
in
the
film
,
mr
.
tingle
's
complete
unprofessionalism
be
let
go
by
all
other
around
she
-lrb-
be
teacher
allow
to
behave
that
way
nowadays
?
-rrb-
and
a
transparent
romance
between
holme
and
some
long-haired
dude
,
hire
to
be
the
poor
man
's
version
of
skeet
ulrich
-lrb-
who
himself
be
a
poor
man
's
version
of
johnny
depp
!
-rrb-
.
all
in
all
,
this
movie
be
laughable
for
I
,
provide
I
with
no
insight
into
anything
,
demonstrate
williamson
's
genuine
lack
of
directorial
skill
alongside
a
juvenile
script
,
and
provide
helen
mirren
with
a
great
role
to
chew
into
,
unfortunately
forget
to
give
she
character
any
believability
,
humanity
or
capacity
to
comprehend
.
no
hip
line
,
no
cheap
thrill
,
just
a
dull
time
at
the
movie
theater
.
if
you
want
to
see
a
funny
teenage
movie
,
go
see
detroit
rock
city
