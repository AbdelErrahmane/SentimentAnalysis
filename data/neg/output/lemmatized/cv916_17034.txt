ah
,
and
1999
be
go
along
so
well
,
too
.
''
she
be
all
that
''
have
the
dubious
distinction
of
be
the
worst
movie
i
have
see
so
far
this
year
.
and
quite
frankly
,
i
doubt
i
'll
see
anything
equally
bad
.
-lrb-
at
least
,
i
\*
hope
\*
i
do
not
see
anything
equally
bad
-rrb-
.
''
she
be
all
that

tell
the
story
of
the
most
popular
guy
in
school
-lrb-
play
by
freddie
prinze
jr
.
-rrb-
who
accept
a
bet
to
transform
the
geekiest
girl
in
school
-lrb-
rachel
leigh
cook
-rrb-
into
the
most
popular
.
that
,
right
there
,
be
problem
#
1
.
how
many
time
have
we
see
this
storyline
?
as
cook
comment
near
the
end
of
the
film
,
''
it
be
kind
of
like
''
pretty
woman
''
,
except
without
the
prostitution
''
.
of
course
,
have
the
filmmaker
attempt
to
try
something
new
with
this
material
,
the
well-worn
storyline
would
have
be
a
device
to
propell
the
movie
forward
.
as
it
be
,
though
,
''
she
be
all
that
''
rely
\*
completely
\*
on
the
lame
and
overused
formulum
to
push
it
ahead
.
there
be
not
one
original
or
interesting
character
in
the
film
,
either
,
and
if
that
be
not
bad
enough
,
there
be
not
one
good
performance
feature
.
the
star
of
the
movie
,
rachel
leigh
cook
,
be
simply
horrible
.
i
usually
do
not
like
to
get
so
personal
,
but
in
this
case
,
i
think
it
need
to
be
say
.
cook
wear
the
same
expression
throughout
the
flick
and
look
to
be
have
as
miserable
a
time
as
i
be
.
i
be
never
convince
that
she
be
a
''
nerd
''
,
and
she
transformation
be
unconvincing
and
unnecessary
.
the
movie
seem
to
be
say
it
be
better
to
be
popular
than
to
be
who
you
be
.
as
for
freddie
prinze
jr
.
,
a
actor
i
ordinarily
enjoy
,
he
too
be
quite
bad
here
.
he
coast
through
the
film
on
so-called
charm
,
and
never
establish
a
real
character
.
kieren
culkin
be
here
,
too
,
as
the
brother
of
cook
.
and
for
some
indiscernable
reason
,
he
be
get
hearing
aid
.
no
explanation
be
give
and
they
be
never
bring
up
.
be
we
suppose
to
feel
\*
sorry
\*
for
he
just
because
he
wear
hearing
aid
?
i
do
not
think
so
.
that
single
element
of
the
film
be
one
of
the
most
offensive
thing
i
have
see
in
a
movie
in
a
long
time
.
''
she
be
all
that
''
suck
.
that
be
what
it
boil
down
to
.
it
be
not
entertaining
,
and
it
be
not
even
a
good
time
passer
.
the
hour
and
a
half
run
time
go
by
slower
than
a
5
minute
hair-removal
system
informercial
.
and
what
be
worse
,
it
send
out
a
bad
message
to
teens
.
it
appear
to
be
tell
they
,
''
hey
,
it
do
not
matter
if
you
be
happy
the
way
you
be
.
that
be
unimportant
.
if
you
want
to
\*
truly
\*
be
happy
,
dress
in
the
latest
fashion
and
act
like
a
bubble-headed
moron
.
''
ugh
.
