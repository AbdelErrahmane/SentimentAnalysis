-
movie
which
be
star
vehicle
be
terrible
thing
.
as
a
rule
,
the
ignore
general
principle
of
cinema
because
they
be
not
make
to
advance
the
media
but
rather
to
advance
the
career
of
a
particular
actor
.
a
actor
might
be
choose
on
the
up-and-up
,
to
give
he
exposure
;
or
he
might
be
choose
on
the
way
down

a
paycheck

generally
,
though
,
the
actor
do
not
matter
,
and
soldier
,
the
latest
from
the
beleaguered
warner
brother
,
exemplify
this
:
the
picture
lack
pizazz
.
the
star
for
the
vehicle
in
this
case
be
kurt
russell
,
otherwise
know
as
the
man
of
thirty
word
or
less
.
russell
play
todd

in

way
of

war
and
become

from
the
carnage
he
have
work
.
the
movie
let
we
see
this
degenerate
process
,
but
by
the
time
the
real
plot
start
,
we
be
into
todd
's
later
year
.
he
be
about
to
be
replace
by
a
new
breed
of
soldier
,
one
who
,
instead
of
be
train
\*
from
\*

,
be
genetically
select

the
pride
of

will
be
we
villain
,
and
you
know
he
be
the
villain
because
he
have
a
stare
contest
with
we
hero
near
the
movie
's
start
.
between
the
two
lead
,
less
than
a
full

of

and
it
be
possible
to
imagine
a
script

be
ninety
percent

not

,
be
leave
to
die
on

;
but
in
order
to
stretch
the
run

out
,
the
villain
return
to

on

''
and
set
the
stage
for

final
firefight
.
event
be
predictable
from
the
time
that
the
setup
be
make
,
and
neither
anderson
nor
scriptwriter
david
people
attempt
to
show
any
creativeness
here
.
the
most
annoying
plot
facet
be
the
reason
that
the
whole
of
the
movie
come
to
be
:
todd
fail
to
show
physical
superiority
against
caine
-
in
fact
,
not
even
todd
and
two
of
he
companion
can
best
the
baddie
-
but
near
the
end
of
the
movie
he
show
remarkable
prowess
with
automatic
weaponry
.
it
be
not
as
though
todd
undergo
any
significant
character
change
throughout
the
plot
of
the
story
,
and
so
the
plot
have
a
very
canned
feeling
about
it
.
the
best
route
through
this
disaster
be
to
take
it
lighthearted
in
spirit
,
and
treat
it
as
a
parody
of
typical
action
fare
,
like
universal
soldier
.
a
strict
interpretation
,
however
,
reveal
a
unmistakeable
and
unforgiveable
lack
of
style
,
class
,
or
substance
;
and
by
next
year
,
a
large
percentage
of
the
people
who
have
see
this
will
have
tape
it
off
of
network
television
.
