1990
would
remember
as
the
era
of
binary
movie
event
in
hollywood
-
two
movie
deal
with
the
same
subject
,
or
,
to
be
precise
,
same
''
high
concept
''
.
in
summer
1994
,
that
''
high
concept
''
be
''
mad
bomber
action
thriller
''
.
in
few
week
,
''
thrillride
of
the
summer
''
actionfest
speed
be
follow
by
rather
action
thriller
blow
away
,
so
disappointing
that
most
of
the
people
these
day
associate
the
title
with
the
1992
thriller
in
which
nicole
eggert
do
few
nude
scene
.
the
movie
begin
in
the
prison
in
northern
ireland
,
where
gaerity
-lrb-
tommy
lee
jone
-rrb-
,
ira
terrorist
with
the
great
talent
to
make
lethal
explosive
device
from
almost
any
material
,
escape
from
prison
.
he
come
to
boston
,
where
he
accidentally
notice
jimmy
dive
-lrb-
jeff
bridge
-rrb-
,
dedicated
bomb
disposal
expert
within
boston
police
.
few
people
except
gaerity
know
the
dive
's
violent
past
,
when
he
use
to
be
ira
terrorist
before
become
sick
with
violence
,
betray
gaerity
and
emigrate
to
america
where
he
change
the
name
and
start
use
he
experience
for
good
purpose
.
gaerity
hold
dive
personally
responsible
for
he
captivity
and
begin
the
campaign
of
bombing
terror
,
direct
specifically
at
dive
's
colleague
,
friend
and
relative
.
dive
,
who
be
just
go
to
retire
and
start
family
,
now
must
confront
the
mad
bomber
.
while
speed
do
not
even
try
to
bother
with
plot
and
character
,
use
they
only
as
a
excuse
for
long
and
spectacular
action
scene
,
blow
away
try
to
be
more
conventional
and
provide
the
action
with
some
back
story
.
and
that
be
the
main
reason
why
it
be
inferior
to
speed
.
badly
write
plot
and
badly
write
character
be
sometimes
worse
than
no
plot
and
no
character
at
all
.
screenplay
by
john
bateer
and
john
rice
,
barely
touch
the
complicated
issue
of
northern
ireland
,
use
the
tragedy
only
as
the
cheap
backstory
for
even
cheaper
drama
.
the
plot
be
,
of
course
,
full
of
implausibility
.
the
main
one
be
the
fact
that
movie
fail
to
explain
how
the
single
individual
,
no
matter
how
brilliant
he
be
,
can
produce
thousand
of
deadly
device
and
hold
entire
city
at
bay
.
those
question
,
same
as
in
the
case
of
speed
,
could
be
forget
while
the
action
go
on
,
but
the
pause
between
action
scene
be
fill
with
cliched
and
predictable
situation
that
should
provide
some
background
to
the
character
.
because
of
they
,
movie
seem
a
little
bit
too
long
,
and
boring
at
time
.
the
most
annoying
element
of
the
film
,
however
,
be
tommy
lee
jone
in
the
role
of
mad
bomber
.
he
acting
be
so
over-the-top
that
potentially
fascinating
villain
turn
into
pathetic
caricature
of
himself
.
this
role
be
in
painful
contrast
with
the
strong
performance
give
by
that
same
actor
in
fugitive
.
the
film
have
few
bright
point
,
though
.
some
of
the
action
scene
be
fine
,
which
should
be
credit
to
director
stephen
hopkin
-lrb-
predator
ii
,
judgement
night
-rrb-
.
and
forrest
whitaker
really
shine
in
minor
role
of
dive
's
colleague
.
but
,
all
in
all
,
blow
away
be
a
film
that
be
justifiably
shadow
by
its
more
famous
,
yet
hardly
unforgettable
competitor
.
