it
be
a
good
thing
most
animated
sci-fi
movie
come
from
japan
,
because
''
titan
a
.
e
.
''
be
proof
that
hollywood
do
not
have
a
clue
how
to
do
it
.
i
do
not
know
what
this
film
be
suppose
to
be
about
.
from
what
i
can
tell
it
be
about
a
young
man
name
kale
who
be
one
of
the
last
survivor
of
earth
in
the
early
31st
century
who
unknowingly
possess
the
key
to
save
and
re-generate
what
be
leave
of
the
human
race
.
that
be
a
fine
premise
for
a
action-packed
sci-fi
animated
movie
,
but
there
be
no
payoff
.
the
story
take
the
main
character
all
over
the
galaxy
in
they
search
for
a
legendary
ship
that
the
evil
''
dredge
''
alien
want
to
destroy
for
no
apparent
reason
.
so
in
the
process
we
get
a
lot
of
spaceship
fight
,
fistfight
,
blaster
fight
and
more
double-cross
than
you
can
shake
a
stick
at
.
there
be
so
much
pointless
sci-fi
banter
it
be
too
much
to
take
.
the
galaxy
here
be
a
total
rip-off
of
the
''
star
war
''
universe
the
creator
do
not
bother
fill
in
the
basic
detail
which
make
the
story
confusing
,
the
character
unmotivated
and
superficial
and
the
plot
just
plain
boring
.
despite
the
fantastic
animation
and
special
effect
,
it
be
just
not
a
interesting
movie
.
