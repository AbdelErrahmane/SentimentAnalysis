have
gaping

the

be

the
only
real

of

''
be
rick

makeup
,
and
even
that
be
a
iffy
affair

no

be
make
to
change
the
human
whiteness
of

giamattus
look
more
like
a

the

be
too
humanize
to
be
give

appeal

tim

deliver
the
most
impressive
act
job
by
get
the
body

right
-
he
nasty
chimpanzee
character
leap
about
,
most
spectacularly
when
mount

steed
,
but
even
's
he
be
undo
by
some
obvious
wire
work
.
bonham
carter
deliver
a
goodly
range
of
emotion
from
behind
a
stiff
prosthetic
,
but
be
undo
in
turn
by
the
silliness
of
the
writing
.
most
of
the
film
have
a
set
bind
look
which
no
amount
of
mist
can
cover

the

city
resemble

dank
complex

''
that
oriental
flavor
be
also
find
in

percussive
score

''
be
the
last
blockbuster
hope
for
the
summer
of

a
dismal
