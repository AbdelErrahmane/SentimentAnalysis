while
watch
loser
,
it
occur
to
I
that
amy
heckerling
's
true
genius
as
a
film-maker
be
cast
.
in
fast
time
at
ridgemont
high
,
she
give
we
sean
penn
's
jeff
spicolus
;
in
look
who
be
talk
,
she
turn
bruce
willi
into
a
wise-cracking
baby
and
provide
john
travolta
with
be
first
career
revival
;
in
clueless
,
she
find
a
star
vehicle
for
the
adorableness
that
be
-lrb-
or
be
-rrb-
alicium
silverstone
.
she
seem
to
understand
instinctively
how
to
find
performer
the
audience
will
like
in
spite
of
they
flaw
.
unfortunately
,
she
may
also
be
start
to
understand
that
she
understand
.
give
appealing

give
appealing
actor
a
script
in
which
they
appeal
_
be
_
the
movie
make
for
unexpectedly
awful
film
like
loser
.
naturally
,
heckerl
make
she
protagonist
a
all-around
swell
guy
.
paul
tannek
-lrb-
jason
bigg
-rrb-
be
a
small-town
boy
who
get
a
scholarship
to
nyu
,
then
instantly
find
himself
a
island
of
compassion
and
diligence
in
the
cold-hearted
big
city
.
paul
be
the
kind
of
guy
who
give
up
he
seat
on
the
subway
to
a
elderly
woman
;
he
roommate
adam
-lrb-
zak
orth
-rrb-
,
chri
-lrb-
tom
sadoskus
-rrb-
and
noah
-lrb-
jimmus
simpson
-rrb-
be
the
kind
of
guy
who
blast
they
music
and
let
they
waterbed
leak
all
over
paul
.
paul
be
also
the
kind
of
guy
who
adore
girl
from
afar
,
in
this
case
the
lovely
dora
diamond
-lrb-
mena
suvarus
-rrb-
.
dora
have
problem
of
she
own
,
include
a
shortage
of
fund
to
pay
she
tuition
and
a
relationship
with
a
professor
,
edward
alcott
-lrb-
greg
kinnear
-rrb-
,
that
be
more
than
slightly
one-sided
.
they
be
two
conscientious
kid
who
love
animal
and
homeless
people
,
so
clearly
they
belong
together
,
even
if
paul
be
a
loser
.
i
must
confess
that
,
for
a
while
,
i
be
sucker
in
by
heckerling
's
casting
.
jason
bigg
be
a
engaging
performer
whose
unconventional
look
make
he
even
easier
to
embrace
;
suvarus
be
a
coquette
with
a
undercurrent
of
intelligence
.
they
be
pleasant
enough
to
watch
,
and
heckerling
give
we
plenty
of
scene
establish
how
nice
they
be
and
how
nice
they
respective
antagonist
be
not
.
then
it
gradually
become
clear
that
there
be
virtually
nothing
to
loser
but
scene
of
that
sort
.
in
theory
,
loser
be
a
romantic
comedy
,
but
there
be
scarcely
a
laugh
to
be
find
in
the
entire
film
-lrb-
notable
exception
:
a
cameo
by
a
scene-stealing
comic
actor
as
a
video
store
clerk
-rrb-
.
instead
of
take
any
time
to
make
the
character
'
situation
funny
,
heckerl
spend
98
minute
make
she
character
'
situation
pathetic
.
she
show
none
of
the
ear
for
quirky
dialogue
that
spark
clueless
,
nor
any
of
that
film
's
interest
in
lively
plot
-lrb-
not
surprisingly
,
since
clueless
's
plot
come
via
jane
austen
's
emma
-rrb-
.
she
simply
turn
the
film
into
a
pity
party
.
since
loser
be
a
film
compose
almost
entirely
of
establish
character
,
you
might
think
that
those
character
would
be
interesting
,
or
at
least
slightly
complicated
.
instead
,
you
have
people
either
so
perfect
or
so
unredeemable
that
there
be
no
reason
to
watch
they
.
paul
be
not
just
a
nice
guy
,
he
be
flawless
;
consequently
,
he
be
a
central
character
who
do
absolutely
no
grow
.
he
roommate
be
not
just
inconsiderate
,
they
be
actively
evil-blackmailing
professor
alcott
,
drug
woman
with
rohypnol
and
generally
give
humanity
a
bad
name
.
and
professor
alcott
be
not
just
manipulative
,
he
turn
dora
into
he
house
slave
.
dora
's
unthinking
devotion
to
alcott
be
the
only
whiff
of
basic
human
frailty
to
be
find
in
loser
,
and
even
that
be
not
explore
in
sufficient
detail
.
there
be
more
ambiguity
in
the
30-second
snippet
from
alan
cumming
's
broadway
performance
as
the
emcee
in
cabaret
then
there
be
in
the
rest
of
loser
it
be
one
thing
to
turn
support
character
into
comic
exaggeration
;
it
be
another
to
flatten
you
lead
into
easily
digestible
mush
.
and
it
would
help
if
those
comic
exaggeration
be
somehow
...
i
do
not
know
...
comic
.
still
,
i
spend
much
of
the
film
hold
out
the
ridiculous
hope
that
heckerl
would
somehow
salvage
loser
from
its
tedium
and
justify
my
desire
to
like
paul
and
dora
.
that
hope
dissolve
the
moment
heckerling
underscore
a
sequence
of
paul
in
the
throe
of
unrequited
love
to
simon
and
garfunkel
's
''
scarborough
fair\/canticle
.
''
instead
of
give
the
sequence
a
know
wink-a
reference
to
the
graduate
,
a
hint
that
paul
be
become
a
overly-sensitive
clich-heckerling
play
it
deadly
straight
.
even
in
the
scene
that
scream
for
a
light
comic
touch
and
a
bit
of
a
poke
at
she
protagonist
's
foible
,
she
find
it
impossible
to
stray
from
the
gospel
of
paul
as
saint
.
clueless
's
cher
have
she
self-absorption
and
manipulative
tendency
to
balance
she
cuteness
.
in
loser
,
amy
heckerling
show
a
leaden
hand
with
material
that
demand
friskiness
