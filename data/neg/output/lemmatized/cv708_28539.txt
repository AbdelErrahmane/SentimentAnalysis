review
by
denni
schwartz
a
bleak
indie
film
about
a
steal
identity
.
there
be
not
much
more
to
this
visually
stylish
film
than
what
meet
the
eye
,
as
it
rely
on
shock
to
tell
its
story
of
a
prolonged
vicious
mugging
.
it
fall
into
the
category
of
be
a
pretentious
art-house
film
,
leave
a
bitter
taste
in
one
's
mouth
as
it
stereotype
its
character
and
unintentionally
further
inflame
the
racial
issue
.
it
try
to
make
a
heavy-handed
point
about
disenfranchised
black
youth
trap
by
they
environment
,
with
they
only
way
out
be
crime
.
but
the
story
be
so
fill
with
violence
and
its
nyc
set
look
like
hell
,
that
it
be
hard
to
enjoy
this
film
and
to
follow
what
the
logic
in
the
story
be
suppose
to
mean
.
the
relationship
between
the
black
mugger
and
he
white
victim
be
a
cloudy
one
,
which
the
film
never
determine
what
it
want
to
say
about
it
.
matt
mahurin
be
virtual
one-man
crew
in
put
this
film
together

,
who
be
a
still
photographer
in
he
day
job
.
the
film
work
best
as
a
visually
challenging
piece
,
as
each
shot
look
like
a
photograph
carefully
tell
the
story
unfold
.
a
white
photographer
-lrb-
robert
knepper

be
mug
by
a
black
gang
while
he
be
on
a
freelance
assignment
to
take
a
photo
shoot
of
harlem
at
night
.
he
become
a
victim
of
amnesia
and
he
head
be
bloody
as
he
be
leave
in
a
desert
harlem
building
,
as
the
gang
leave
he
for
dead
;
but
,
one
of
the
mugger
,
rumor
-lrb-
michael
william
-rrb-
,
come
back
and
pretend
to
help
he
.
he
be
a
would-be
photographer
,
who
keep
a
scrapbook
entitle
mugshot
in
the
project
apartment
he
share
with
he
mother
and
younger
brother
.
keep
he
victim
in
the
dark
about
who
he
be
by
call
he
joe
and
not
tell
he
what
be
happen
,
he
become
the
photographer
for
a
few
day
.
he
enter
the
photographer
's
stylish
greenwich
village
apartment
and
steal
he
expensive
camera
,
and
decide
to
hold
the
mugging
vic
for
ransom
when
he
find
out
he
have
a
black
girlfriend
,
stellum
-lrb-
belinda
becker
-rrb-
.
she
be
the
only
one
in
the
film
who
could
act
.
the
film
be
stick
with
a
clumsy
dialogue
and
a
overuse
of
symbolism
,
as
it
end
with
nothing
more
to
tell
after
the
shock
and
the
violent
situation
it
create
except
to
beat
it
into
the
ground
.
it
could
only
be
commend
for
how
appeal
the
film
look
,
as
if
it
be
a
scrapbook
of
still
photo
put
together
to
celebrate
a
mugging
.
