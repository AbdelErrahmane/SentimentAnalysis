however
,
i
doubt
that
people
be
go
to
be
very
nostalgic
about
the
hollywood
product
of
that
period
.
one
of
the
reason
would
surely
be
film
like
national
lampoon
's
loaded

,
that
,
in
many
way
,
symbolise
the
biggest
problem
of
contemporary
american
film
industry
-
lack
of
originality
and
idea

lack

before
they
undertake
the
project

and
that
reflect
in
the
lack
plot

character
,
and
,
even
original
line
.
the
plot
,
or
what
go
for
the
plot
in
this
movie
,
be
nothing
more
than
a
series
of
gag
that
make
laugh
of
some
popular
film
make
in

the
rest
simply
do

only
those
who
use
to
watch
a
lot
of
hollywood
product
in
that
period
would
laugh
.
other
would
probably
wince
at
the
lameness
of
humor
.
some
would
be
entertain
by
celebrity
cameo
that
pop
up
every
once
in
a
while
.
but
,
at
the
end
,
spend
hour
and
half
in

of
this
disorganised
mess
of
a
movie
be
simply
not
worth
the
effort
.
the
film
be
sometimes
criticise
for
be
the
parody
of
a

that
already
have
strong
comic
overtone
