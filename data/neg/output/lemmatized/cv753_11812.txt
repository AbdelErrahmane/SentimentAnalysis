to
help
out

but
she
be
give
very
little
to
do
overall
.
the
central
concept
behind
mercury
rise
be
ludicrous
.
why
bother
try

kill
the

...
i
mean
,
who
would
know
?
it

even
if

,
what
do
that
help

he
be
already
prove
that
mercury
can
be
break
.
there
be
always
the
chance
that
someone
else
would
crack
it
...
but
i
guess
without
a
kid
in
jeopardy
,
there
be
not
much
of
a
movie
here
.
for
all
its
fault
,
the
film
actually
start
relatively
well
-lrb-
once
you
pass
the
painfully
familiar
teaser

the
film
flirt
with
develop
real
character

and
a
semblance

then
mr

miko

do
a
decent
job
,
for

age
,
at
create
a

performance

however
,
do
not
go
to
this
film
look
for
any
new
insight
into
autism
-lrb-
not
that
many
people
will
-rrb-
.
instead
he
merely
become
the
latest
unique
partner
in

routine
buddy-cop
movie
-lrb-
think
cop
and
a
half
...
with
a
twist
!
-rrb-
willi
and
baldwin
be
just
overplay
to
type
.
rather
than
create
a
nuanced
character
,
baldwin
simply
ooze
sliminess
.
and
for
willi
'
part
,
he
simply
recycle
the
stock
role
of
the
loner
cop\/fbi
agent
-lrb-
which
he
have
hone
in
the
die
hard
series
-rrb-
.
as
almost
a
afterthought
,
about
halfway
through
,
the
film
carelessly
give
he
a
character
trait
-lrb-
a
addiction
-rrb-
,
and
then
drop
it
in
the
next
scene
.
but
the
biggest
problem
with
mercury
rise
be
the
screenplay
.
this
film
be
not
well
think
out
at
all
.
the
film
go
to
extraordinary
length
to
pad
in
as
many
convenient
coincidence
as
possible
.
the
carbon
paper
scene
alone
be
unworthy
of
the
most
gullible
audience
member
.
at
first
the
bad
scene
just
trickle
in
,
but
by
the
gruesomely
bad
finale
they
be
a
veritable
flood
.
the
film
's
few
decent
moment
come
in
the
form
of
bad
joke
-lrb-
mainly
from
the
geek
who
develop
the
supercode
-rrb-
.
but
they
be
not
nearly
enough
to
make
the
film
worthwhile
.
mercury
rising
be
a
thriller
that
you
be
more
likely
to
groan
at
than
cheer
.
