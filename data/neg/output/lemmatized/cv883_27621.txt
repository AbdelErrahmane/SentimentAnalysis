graduate
to
idiocy
.

play
the
part
be
model
in
real
life
...

-rrb-
join
monica
potter
-lrb-
in
a
role
which
can
only
be
describe
as
a
obvious
cry
for
help
-rrb-
and
freddie
prinze
jr
.
-lrb-
not
the
actor
,
but
the
character
better
know
as
freddie
prinze
jr
.
-rrb-
,
in
a
plot
so
stupid
and
far-fetched
,
that
you
have
to
wonder
once
more
,
how
crap
like
this
get
by
the
hollywood
bigwig
.
this
thing
stink
to
high-heaven
.
it
be
just
plain
embarrassing
for
everyone
involve
.
i
even
feel
my
iq
dip
below
its
usual
low
as
toilet
humor
somehow
work
its
way
into
this
so-called
romantic-comedy-action
movie
?

a
pile
of
dung
.

frustration
come
from
time
to
time
.
it
be
sad
really
.
a
movie
which
actually
have
quite
a
few
people
in
my
audience
laugh
at
its
idiocy
,
include
the
over-used
''
folk
hide
in
the
bathroom
while
someone
else
come
in
to
take
a
crap
and
fart
''
gag
.
and
how
about
that
dumb
blonde
model
who
keep
run
into
thing
.
pure
hilarity
!

maybe
i
be
just
too
jaded
,
too
much
of
a

,
not
relax
enough
to
enjoy
this
fluff-piece
...

chockfull
of
stupid
character

inane
dialogue
fitting
snuggly
into

the
kind
of
movie
that
have
one
character
insert
another
character
into
a
car
headfirst
to
the
floor
only
because
...

of
the
model
girl
...

and
make
sure
to
give
we
the
opportunity
of
leave
the
theater
after

minute
of
manufacture
garbage
,
so
that
we
could
run
out
as
fast
as

down
the
street
