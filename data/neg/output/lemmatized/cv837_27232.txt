a
disappointing
biography
about
the
homosexual
relationship
of
two
famous
19th
century
french
poet
.
the
film
manage
to
remove
all
the
poetry
from
the
poet
and
instead
concentrate
on
they
abrasive
personality
.
the
result
be
merely
a
academic
exercise
,
leave
a
emotional
vacuum
that
it
could
not
build
on
to
show
they
as
the
poet
they
be
.
on
paper
,
this
should
not
have
be
so
terrible
--
it
have
a
talented
director
in
agnieszka
holland
-lrb-
''
the
secret
garden
''
-rrb-
,
a
proven
screenwriter
in
christopher
hampton
-lrb-
dangerous
liaison
-rrb-
,
and
a
capable
cast
.
but
the
film
be
do
in
by
its
inept
script
,
the
unappealing
way
the
film
be
direct
,
and
the
miscasting
of
leonardo
dicaprio
as
rimbaud
.
i
find
he
performance
to
be
the
most
risible
one
in
the
film
,
with
he
act
more
like
a
teenage
brat
than
a
young
genius
,
spout
obsenity
without
give
a
hint
that
a
true
poet
lie
behind
that
facade
.
he
,
especially
,
look
bad
because
david
thewli
as
paul
verlaine
look
so
good
despite
the
turgid
dialogue
that
be
thrust
upon
he
and
how
thin
a
character
he
be
force
to
be
.
but
when
the
two
of
they
be
together
,
it
look
like
a
mismatch
.
leonardo
's
rimbaud
only
make
the
young
poet
look
petulant
and
crude
,
yet
we
know
from
rimbaud
's
poetry
,
that
he
must
have
have
something
go
for
he
because
he
poetry
be
awe
inspiring
.
the
film
open
in
post-revolutionary
france
in
1871
,
the
16-year-old
rimbaud
have
send
the
established
symbolist
poet
verlaine
a
letter
with
he
poem
.
he
accept
verlaine
's
praise
and
invitation
to
be
a
house
guest
in
he
splendid
paris
home
,
and
rimbaud
leave
he
sullen
farm
in
rural
charleville
.
once
there
,
rimbaud
be
disappoint
in
the
bourgeoisie
household
,
have
a
immediate
conflict
with
verlaine
's
busty
18-year-old
wife
mathilde
-lrb-
romane
-rrb-
,
and
find
to
he
regret
that
the
drunken
verlaine
love
he
rich
wife
for
she
body
and
that
he
live
off
she
family
's
money
,
even
though
he
have
nothing
else
in
common
with
she
.
when
verlaine
state
,
''
poet
can
learn
from
one
another
,
''
rimbaud
reply
in
a
haughty
tone
,
''
only
if
they
be
bad
poet
.
''
he
will
continue
to
treat
the
older
poet
like
dirt
for
the
rest
of
they
relationship
.
verlaine
prove
to
be
weak-willed
,
beat
he
wife
regularly
,
and
play
just
as
despicable
a
character
as
rimbaud
.
when
mathilde
's
father
kick
rimbaud
out
of
the
house
,
verlaine
find
he
in
a
room
house
and
the
two
become
lover
.
it
be
a
real
downer
to
watch
this
story
unfold
into
a
series
of
obnoxious
behavior
pattern
on
the
part
of
the
two
poet
,
which
lead
they
to
travel
together
and
mathilde
ask
for
a
divorce
.
in
brussels
,
verlaine
get
arrest
for
sodomy
and
spend
two
year
in
jail
.
while
rimbaud
become
angered
at
the
literary
world
and
never
write
another
poem
after
he
become
19
.
he
instead
go
to
north
africa
and
become
a
adventurer
and
a
gun-runner
,
and
after
ten
year
there
,
come
home
with
a
tumor
on
he
knee
and
die
a
changed
man
at
the
age
of
37
.
the
hopeless
relationship
between
the
two
be
what
the
picture
cover
in
detail
and
that
be
not
very
satisfying
.
the
film
end
on
a
whimper
...
with
verlaine
talk
with
rimbaud
's
sister
about
she
brother
and
the
poem
of
he
he
still
possess
,
which
the
sister
want
destroy
so
as
not
to
embarrass
the
family
or
ruin
the
name
of
she
deceased
brother
if
publish
.
this
film
be
especially
annoying
because
rimbaud
's
poem
be
fill
with
a
visionary
tenseness
that
be
not
even
approach
in
this
film
,
as
the
film
only
manage
to
skim
the
surface
of
the
life
of
these
poet
and
completely
ignore
the
value
of
they
poetry
.
i
have
no
idea
what
the
filmmaker
be
try
to
say
in
this
film
,
but
whatever
it
be
,
it
just
do
not
work
.
it
certainly
do
not
bring
any
light
into
understand
what
rimbaud
mean
to
modern
poetry
and
why
he
earn
the
reputation
as
the
so-called
father
of
modern
poetry
.
