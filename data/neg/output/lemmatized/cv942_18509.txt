at
first
glance
,
i
think
that
the
sword
and
the
sorceror
have
promise
.
its
plotline
go
like
this
:
the
evil
king
cromwell
,
desire
to
take
over
the
world
,
resurrect
a
evil
,
ancient
sorceror
,
xusium
for
power
.
he
attack
the
kingdom
of
eh-dan
and
kill
young
prince
talon
's
parent
.
give
a
triple-bladed
sword
-lrb-
which
can
shoot
bad
guy
,
like
a
gun
-rrb-
by
he
die
father
,
talon
vow
for
revenge
.
eleven
year
later
,
when
he
be
establish
he
own
army
,
the
mercanery
,
he
vow
to
take
back
he
kingdom
.
along
the
way
,
he
meet
up
with
alana
,
whose
village
be
attack
by
drunken
guard
and
she
brother
be
kidnap
by
cromwell
.
talon
vow
to
help
,
and
,
after
a
series
of
minor
escapade
,
eventually
end
up
rescue
alana
's
brother
-lrb-
and
several
other
prisoner
-rrb-
,
only
to
be
capture
himself
-lrb-
in
other
word
,
put
on
a
cross
to
be
crucify
!
-rrb-
.
fortunately
he
free
himself
,
rescue
alana
from
marry
cromwell
,
defeat
xusium
,
and
then
cromwell
,
all
with
he
triple
bladed
sword
-lrb-
during
the
final
battle
,
the
blade
break
,
but
talon
finish
cromwell
off
by
use
a
hidden
dagger
in
the
blade
-rrb-
.
then
,
everything
end
happily
.
unfortunately
,
the
sword
and
the
sorcerer
be
not
even
half
as
good
as
it
sound
.
what
would
have
be
a
great
film
be
completely
destroy
by
uneven
plot
jump
,
bad
acting
,
and
gruesomely
gory
,
bloody
scene
.
never
once
do
the
story
seem
to
connect
together
,
it
just
jump
around
repeatedly
.
this
problem
be
extremely
noticeable
in
the
opening
scene
where
cromwell
resurrect
xusium
.
after
tell
he
that
he
need
he
help
,
he
lead
the
warlock
out
into
daylight
,
but
then
stab
he
and
send
he
careen
off
a
cliff
afterwards
.
wait
a
minute
,
do
not
the
plotline
say
that
he
need
the
help
of
xusium
in
order
to
invade
eh-dan
,
which
he
can
not
do
by
military
force
?
if
that
be
the
case
,
why
do
he
dispose
of
xusium
after
resurrect
he
?
and
why
do
he
manage
to
take
over
eh-dan
anyway
?
these
question
be
just
never
-
no
,
never
-
answer
in
the
film
.
another
example
be
that
one
moment
we
see
talon
fight
for
he
life
,
another
moment
we
see
he
just
about
to
be
crucify
during
alana
's
wedding
to
cromwell
-lrb-
!
-rrb-
,
and
finally
at
the
end
,
instead
of
settle
down
with
alana
,
he
just
tell
she
to
''
wait
''
,
and
then
he
just
ride
off
!
in
addition
to
the
extremely
bloody
scene
,
this
uneven
plot
jump
completely
destroy
what
would
have
be
a
great
fantasy
adventure
.
even
some
attempt
to
make
it
exciting
,
a
few
fire
scene
,
battle
scene
,
do
not
work
.
it
just
completely
fail
altogether
miserably
.
the
only
good
thing
about
this
film
be
its
musical
score
,
contribute
by
david
whittaker
,
who
have
a
-lrb-
extremely
-rrb-
short
music
compose
career
.
the
score
be
boomy
and
adventurous
,
powerful
,
and
a
billion
time
better
than
this
film
be
.
my
suggestion
:
steer
the
hell
away
from
this
bloody
mess
and
buy
the
soundtrack
album
instead
-lrb-
if
you
can
find
it
-rrb-
.
ironically
,
though
,
before
the
film
's
credit
roll
,
there
be
a
message
indicate
that
a
sequel
,
tale
of
the
ancient
empire
,
would
follow
.
to
my
relief
-lrb-
and
delight
-rrb-
,
it
never
get
into
production
,
because
the
sword
and
the
sorcerer
lay
a
egg
at
the
box
office
,
gross
only
$
39
million
.
critic
be
right
on
in
slam
the
sword
and
the
sorcerer
,
all
right
.
leonard
maltin
rightfully
call
it
''
second
rate
in
scripting
,
and
act
''
and
at-a-glance
film
review
call
it
''
a
confusing
,
stupid
,
unimaginative
,
unengaging
,
bloodfilled
bear
''
.
i
totally
agree
with
these
review
,
all
right
,
and
i
hope
that
this
piece
of
#
$
%
!
will
be
forget
about
.
there
be
far
better
fantasy
movie
than
the
sword
and
the
sorcerer
.
i
hope
you
get
a
good
laugh
out
of
this
review
,
but
i
be
not
laugh
.
in
fact
,
my
insult
do
not
even
come
close
to
the
gruesome
sickness
that
this
film
give
I
throughout
its
100
minute
run
time
.
