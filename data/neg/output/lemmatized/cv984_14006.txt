look
for

which
they
find

one
wish
that
cliff
would
reappear
,
but
,
as
they
say
,
be
careful
what
you
wish
for
.
not
surprisingly
,
he
do
resurface
,
and
it
then
become
clear
that
this
be
a
character
that
be
best
take
in
a
small
dose
;
almost
immediately
,
he
extended
boorish
and
sociopathic

lose
its
novelty
.
the
same
can
be
say
about
all
of

.
whatever
morbid
appeal
the
far-fetched
premise
have
quickly
evaporate
,
and
the
self-absorbed
character
,
especially
cooper
,
pretty
much
grate
from
the
get-go
.
_

_
do
not
grow
tiresome
;
it
already

once
the
clever
opening
title
be
through

as
it
slog
along
to
a
cheesy
,
happy-for-all-parties
conclusion
,
_
dead_man
_
live
up
to
its
title
and
then
some
--
not
only
do
the
movie
grow
even
more
tired
and
die
,
it
still
insist
on
go
on
...
like
a
zombie
