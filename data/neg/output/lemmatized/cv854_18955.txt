have
hollywood
run
out
of
interesting
character
and
plot-driven
suspense
thriller
that
we
must
spend
two
hour
watch
will
smith
and
a
gritty
gene
hackman
exchange
obtuse
dialogue
and
run
around
dodge
fireball
?
in
enemy
of
the
state
,
that
be
exactly
right
.
a
few
part
the
net
,
and
a
few
part
conspiracy
theory
,
enemy
be
about
as
exciting
as
watch
smith
talk
to
cgus
alien
in
1997
's
lame
brained
man
in
black
.
will
this
guy
ever
get
a
real
role
?
he
have
the
bruce
willi
syndrome
.
the
plot
be
bascially
smith
,
play
a
lawyer
,
get
into
hot
water
with
some
high
government
murderer
,
who
assassinate
a
powerful
political
figure
earlier
in
the
movie
,
when
a
tape
of
the
killing
get
into
he
hand
.
he
inlist
the
help
of
a
old
conspirator
-lrb-
hackman
-rrb-
,
and
,
at
the
end
,
er
...
you
know
.
enemy
be
one
of
the
worst
film
of
last
year
.
not
only
be
it
sloppy
in
tell
its
story
and
get
its
fact
straight
,
the
acting
be
mediocre
when
it
should
have
be
energy
drive
,
and
i
do
not
like
how
smith
always
magically
out-smart
the
bady
when
all
the
other
extra
character
,
seem
more
intelligent
than
smith
,
somehow
get
run
over
by
a
truck
.
enemy
come
out
around
the
same
time
as
the
superior
star
trek
:
insurrection
.
i
know
these
two
film
be
different
in
,
well
,
everything
,
but
the
fact
that
enemy
outgross
insurrection
just
baffel
I
.
somehow
,
quality
can
not
overshadow
quantity
.
