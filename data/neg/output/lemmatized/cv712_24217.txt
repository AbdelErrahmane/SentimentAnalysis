preposterous
religious
action
film
-lrb-
produce
by
the
trinity
broadcasting
network
-rrb-
about
a
code
hide
within
the
text
of
the
bible
that
when
decipher
will
lead
to
the
end
of
the
world
-lrb-
nice
of
those
bible
author
to
put
a
doomsday
code
into
the
most
read
book
ever
eh
?
-rrb-
.
michael
york
play
a
millionaire
diplomat
who
break
the
code
and
set
out
to
become
god
on
earth
and
fulfill
the
doomsday
prophecy
,
while
casper
van
dien
-lrb-
terribly
miscast
and
give
a
awful
performance
as
a
result
-rrb-
play
the
atheist
motivational
speaker
who
must
stop
he
.
michael
ironside
-lrb-
great
as
always
,
despite
the
silly
film
surround
he
-rrb-
play
a
fall
priest
and
right
hand
man
to
michael
york
's
character
.
here
be
some
subtle
character
development
you
may
have
miss
pertain
to
ironside
's
character
.
now
despite
the
fact
that
we
see
he
murder
a
man
in
the
opening
scene
,
the
filmmaker
be
not
quite
sure
if
they
audience
will
understand
that
he
be
evil
.
how
do
they
fix
that
?
make
specific
effort
to
show
that
he
character
be
the
only
one
in
the
film
who
smoke
!
there
be
lot
of
ominous
shot
of
michael
ironside
smoking
...
oooooo
scary
.
but
even
that
be
not
enough
for
the
filmmaker
apparently
,
as
they
later
have
to
infer
that
ironside
's
character
be
gay
!
it
come
out
of
nowhere
and
just
make
no
sense
.
my
main
problem
with
this
film
be
that
,
despite
the
silly
story
-lrb-
which
could
have
be
pull
off
...
anything
can
be
make
believable
if
execute
correctly
-rrb-
,
the
event
of
the
film
be
not
show
with
any
sense
of
urgency
or
importance
.
for
example
,
at
one
point
york
's
character
be
declare
chancellor
of
the
world
or
something
,
and
we
see
one
brief
,
cheesy
news
report
about
it
.
the
movie
keep
tell
we
that
the
apocalypse
be
come
,
but
it
never
seem
that
way
.
there
be
no
''
world
reaction
''
to
anything
.
the
omega
code
be
available
on
dvd
from
goodtime
home
video
.
it
contain
the
film
in
the
original
theatrical
aspect
ratio
of
1
.
85
:
1
,
and
include
the
original
theatrical
trailer
,
a
documentary
on
the
making
of
the
film
,
production
note
,
and
cast
and
crew
information
.
the
documentary
run
about
25
minute
and
be
actually
surprisingly
good
-lrb-
it
look
as
though
it
be
make
for
broadcast
on
tbn
-rrb-
,
and
it
do
a
comprehensive
job
of
interview
practically
everyone
in
the
cast
and
crew
-lrb-
with
the
exception
of
michael
ironside
,
unfortunately
-rrb-
.
the
best
thing
about
it
be
that
whenever
crew
member
be
interview
,
they
do
a
excellent
job
of
explain
they
profession
and
exactly
what
it
be
they
do
on
a
movie
set
.
most
documentary
tend
to
overlook
this
.
doomsday
expert
hal
lindsey
be
even
interview
-lrb-
you
'll
remember
he
documentary
from
the
1970
's
call
the
late
great
planet
earth
,
where
lindsey
speculate
that
jimmy
carter
might
actually
be
the
antichrist
-rrb-
.
however
,
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
documentary
the
producer
of
the
film
manage
to
get
on
my
bad
side
.
when
interview
they
actually
have
the
nerve
to
say
''
ever
see
raider
of
the
lose
ark
?
well
,
we
film
be
like
that
!
''
no
it
be
not
.
not
by
a
long
shot
.
