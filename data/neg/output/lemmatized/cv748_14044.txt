in
this
abysmal
comedy
.
he
play
doctor
john
dolittle
,
who
as
a
child
have
the
ability
to
understand
animal
.
however
,
after
be
`
exorcise

he
lose
this
ability
,
and
we
fast
forward
to
see
dolittle
in
a
crummy
job
surround
by
crummy
people
-lrb-
most
notably
dr
mark

play

-rrb-
however
,
with
a
bonk
on
the
head
he
ability

return
,
and
`
comedy
'
be
ready
and
wait
to
happen

except
comedy
never
do
happen
.
doctor
dolittle
,
even
with
the
excellent
premise
,
rarely
manage
to
raise
a
laugh
.
poor
old
murphy
look
bored
stiff
throughout
the
whole
movie
,
and
he
performance
suffer
.
the
manic
murphy
we
see
in
the
80
's
be
go
,
he
more
mature
-lrb-
and
more
boring
-rrb-
twin
appear
to
be
get
all
the
work
in
the
90
's
.
the
voice
of
the
animal
,
which
include
albert
brook
,
chri
rock
-lrb-
the
`
new
'
eddie
murphy
-rrb-
and
norm
mcdonald
as
`
lucky
'
the
dog
be
marginally
better
,
and
at
least
they
put
enthusiasm
in
the
movie
.
sadly
,
most
of
they
line
be
pretty
dumb
.
and
they
be
not
`
funny
'
dumb
,
like
dumb
&
dumber
-lrb-
1994
-rrb-
,
but
just
boring
dumb
.
the
film
even
succumb
to
fart
joke
halfway
through
,
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
raise
some
laugh
.
there
be
a
few
good
joke
in
the
script
,
but
they
be
few
and
far
between
.
if
i
have
to
choose
a
favorite
performance
,
it
would
probably
be
albert
brook
tiger
,
who
have
a
certain
charm
about
he
.
sadly
,
he
be
barely
in
the
movie
,
and
rock
's
really
annoying
hamster
be
give
far
too
much
screen
time
.
joke
wise
,
we
be
thankfully
,
spare
the
mocking
and
insulting
type
of
joke
that
feature
heavily
in
the
nutty
professor
.
the
director
,
betty
thoma
,
have
,
well
,
do
better
film
.
she
buy
we
private
part
-lrb-
1997
-rrb-
and
the
brady
bunch
movie
-lrb-
1995
-rrb-
which
be
,
sadly
,
much
better
than
this
.
the
scene
lack
any
charm
,
she
just
get
the
job
do
.
the
animal
themselves
,
be
reasonable
realistic
,
although
most
of
they
be
obviously
puppet
.
there
be
a
impressive
look
tiger
,
however
,
and
the
lip
sync
be
pretty
good
.
you
would
have
no
problem
guess
that
most
of
the
close
up
's
be
puppet
,
however
,
with
they
jilt
movement
.
i
be
hope
jim
henson
workshop
,
who
create
the
furry
friend
,
would
have
do
a
better
job
.
doctor
dolittle
,
in
the
end
,
be
a
disappointment
for
everyone
involve
.
murphy
have
do
much
better
movie
-lrb-
i
.
e
trading
place
-rrb-
the
director
have
see
better
day
,
and
even
the
creature
be
not
that
good
.
the
target
audience
,
aged
between
7-13
,
who
be
undemanding
,
will
probably
like
it
however
,
thanks
to
it
be
dumb
down
humor
.
everyone
else
,
however
,
should
give
doctor
dolittle
a
miss
.
