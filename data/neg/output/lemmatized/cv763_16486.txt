it
use
to
be
that
not
just
anyone
could
become
a
vampire
.
usually
,
you
have
to
be
a
aristocrat
-
a
count
such
as
draculum
or
karnstein
.
to
qualify
,
you
would
have
to
have
a
modicum
of
sophistication
,
so
you
would
at
least
look
cool
-
or
suave
-
when
bite
into
some
young
damsel
's
throat
.
but
today
,
in
we
overly
politically
correct
world
,
any
scuzzy-looking
,
long-haired
,
unshaven
lout
or
any
spiked-haired
harridan
can
put
the
bite
on
you
.
by
the
same
token
,
to
be
a
vampire
hunter
,
one
have
to
have
some
sort
of
medical
training
and
knowledge
of
the
occult
or
maybe
perhaps
be
some
sort
of
professional
soldier
,
or
at
least
one
who
retire
with
honor
.
not
in
these
time
.
all
you
need
be
some
sharp
weapon
,
some
bullet
forge
from
silver
and
any
yahoo
can
be
a
buffy
-
or
a
blade
.
without
sound
elitist
,
the
fear
of
vampire
have
greatly
diminish
because
of
this
lack
of
exclusivity
.
which
bring
we
to
blade
,
the
latest
in
a
long
line
of
vampire
movie
in
which
,
it
seem
,
half
the
population
be
put
the
bite
on
the
other
half
.
not
only
be
there
thousand
of
vampire
,
but
they
seem
to
move
from
city
to
city
,
pay
off
police
department
and
,
most
importantly
,
establish
they
own
exclusive
after-hour
rave
in
which
the
highlight
be
the
sprinkler
system
go
off
and
douse
all
the
occupant
in
a
blood
shower
.
with
all
that
blood
,
you
wonder
why
they
have
to
hunt
for
victim
.
you
also
wonder
when
they
get
the
time
to
get
they
clothes
dry-cleaned
and
why
no
cleaner
ever
complain
about
all
the
bloodstain
.
blade
,
which
be
base
on
a
marvel
comic
book
character
,
be
,
like
a
comic
book
,
all
visual
.
the
plot
be
basically
blade
repetitiously
slash
he
way
through
the
vampire
army
seek
they
leader
,
deacon
frost
.
it
be
all
hokum
and
nonsense
,
of
course
.
but
the
filmmaker
play
it
straight
.
unfortunately
,
at
least
at
the
advance
screening
i
attend
,
the
audience
do
not
see
it
that
way
and
laugh
through
much
of
the
proceedings
.
you
know
a
movie
be
in
trouble
when
the
scene
of
blood
and
gore
that
should
elicit
scream
of
fright
instead
evoke
peel
of
laughter
.
another
tell-tale
sign
be
when
the
audience
seem
to
be
admire
the
hero
's
costume
more
than
the
hero
.
also
it
seem
it
be
not
enough
for
today
's
vampire
merely
to
have
fang
.
he
must
also
be
proficient
in
the
martial
art
.
why
a
supernatural
being
,
one
of
the
undead
,
need
such
skill
be
beyond
I
.
-lrb-
of
course
,
this
concept
date
to
the
1974
hammer
films-run
run
shaw
production
of
legend
of
the
seven
golden
vampire
,
in
which
draculum
be
defeat
by
seven
karate-chopping
sibling
.
-rrb-
wesley
snipe
be
buff
as
blade
.
he
growl
he
line
-
the
few
he
have
-
and
spend
most
of
the
time
glowering
-
as
if
he
be
suffer
from
indigestion
or
have
second
thought
about
star
in
and
co-produce
this
turkey
.
blade
be
just
another
example
of
how
the
vampire
film
,
a
once
honorable
member
of
the
horror
family
,
have
go
downhill
.
this
dud
mostly
make
you
yearn
for
those
quaint
old
day
when
christopher
lee
could
be
stop
just
by
dangle
a
crucifix
in
he
face
.
today
's
vampire
lack
the
panache
,
the
style
of
a
belum
lugosus
or
a
christopher
lee
.
they
be
not
even
worthy
enough
to
carry
those
great
bloodsucker
'
cape
.
they
be
more
farcical
than
frightful
.
this
whole
enterprise
be
one
dull
blade
that
could
have
use
lot
of
sharpen
.
