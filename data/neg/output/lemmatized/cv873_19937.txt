overblown
remake
of
the
1963
robert
wise
film
of
the
same
name
-lrb-
base
on
shirley
jackson
's
novel
''
the
haunting
of
hill
house
''
-rrb-
star
lili
taylor
as
one
of
three
''
lab
rat
''
that
participate
in
a
suppose
''
insomnia
''
study
be
initiate
by
liam
neeson
.
he
be
actually
conduct
a
study
on
the
cause
of
fear
and
why
the
human
mind
be
still
affect
by
it
.
he
drag
the
test
subject
out
to
a
foreboding
mansion
where
all
type
of
''
creepy
''
cgus
effect
scare
the
cast
and
try
the
audience
's
patience
.
i
know
this
question
have
be
pose
before
,
but
why
do
people
keep
remake
good
movie
?
the
original
be
a
great
psychological
horror
film
.
this
new
version
be
dull
and
very
decidedly
not
scary
.
in
fact
,
i
feel
it
be
downright
impossible
to
make
a
modern
day
pg-13
horror
movie
that
be
scary
.
unless
you
find
obvious
computer
generate
special
effect
frightening
,
then
there
be
nothing
in
this
film
that
will
raise
hackles
.
i
nearly
fall
asleep
twice
during
the
film
,
and
probably
would
have
if
they
guy
two
row
behind
I
do
not
seem
to
have
such
a
personal
relationship
with
the
character
that
he
feel
he
need
to
discuss
every
decision
they
make
with
they
as
the
film
progress
.
it
be
sad
to
see
such
a
amazing
cast
waste
so
badly
.
owen
wilson
spend
most
of
the
film
wander
the
hall
of
the
house
,
and
the
script
do
no
justice
to
he
wonderful
comic
ability
.
catherine
zeta-jone
-lrb-
always
nice
to
look
at
-rrb-
be
give
the
woefully
underwritten
role
of
a
bi-sexual
insomniac
that
get
to
run
out
of
she
bedroom
perplexed
every
time
some
strange
noise
occur
.
liam
neeson
pop
in
from
time
to
time
to
talk
into
he
tape
recorder
and
attempt
to
convince
the
other
that
he
have
as
much
knowledge
about
what
be
go
on
as
the
rest
of
they
do
.
finally
,
poor
lili
taylor
,
the
center
of
the
film
,
get
the
brunt
of
the
cgi
effect
throw
at
she
while
everyone
else
get
to
scream
and
try
to
rescue
she
.
apparently
,
a
subplot
involve
a
tryst
between
zeta-jone
and
taylor
's
character
be
film
but
remove
.
that
be
too
bad
,
because
it
might
have
lend
some
better
characterization
to
the
narrative
.
this
be
jan
de
bont
's
second
straight
misfire
-lrb-
speed
2
:
cruise
control
be
the
first
-rrb-
.
when
be
he
go
to
learn
that
bigger
be
not
always
necessarily
better
?
robert
wise
know
that
when
he
make
the
original
and
the
make
of
the
blair
witch
project
also
know
that
.
one
should
not
approach
a
haunt
house
movie
with
a
twister
mindset
.
if
de
bont
and
screenwriter
david
self
have
let
we
mind
fill
in
the
blank
as
to
what
be
happen
instead
of
show
we
everything
,
it
would
have
serve
to
make
the
film
terrifying
.
what
we
mind
fashion
on
it
be
own
can
be
a
thousand
time
more
frightening
than
have
have
it
completely
lead
towards
everything
.
apparently
,
yet
another
version
of
this
story
be
be
film
under
it
be
original
title
.
i
certainly
hope
that
this
newer
rendition
will
not
be
hurt
by
the
insanity
of
jan
de
bont
's
version
and
that
it
will
retain
the
psychological
impact
that
the
original
release
have
.
