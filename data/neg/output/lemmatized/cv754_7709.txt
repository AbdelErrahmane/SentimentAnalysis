capsule
:
godawful
''
comedy
''
that
be
amazingly
shabby
and
cut-rate
,
and
rather
bereft
of
laugh
.
i
be
have
a
bad
week
in
my
life
when
i
see
austin
power
:
international
man
of
mystery
.
i
desperately
need
something
to
cheer
I
up
,
or
at
least
distract
I
so
i
could
get
a
clear
head
.
get
some
perspective
.
even
dumb
movie
can
do
that
for
I
,
sometimes
.
i
try
hard
not
to
let
my
dejection
affect
my
judgment
,
but
i
be
certain
now
that
austin
power
would
have
also
suck
rock
through
bamboo
shoot
on
the
day
i
win
the
lottery
.
michael
myer
have
take
a
character
that
would
barely
have
support
a
five-minute
sketch
on
Saturday
night
live
and
stretch
it
to
the
length
of
a
feature
film
,
pad
it
out
with
toilet
joke
and
the
sort
of
props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera
gag
that
benny
hill
get
tire
of
fifteen
year
ago
.
the
plot
,
what
little
there
be
of
it
:
back
in
the
swing
mod
hep
sixty
-lrb-
i
do
not
think
i
be
do
a
disservice
to
the
movie
's
attempt
early
look
and
feel
by
describe
it
that
way
-rrb-
,
sexy
british
secret
agent
austin
power
tangle
with
he
nemesis
dr
.
evil
.
evil
launch
himself
into
orbit
and
cryogenically
forze
himself
to
return
decade
later
,
when
power
be
out
of
the
picture
.
power
also
have
himself
frozen
,
and
he
wake
up
to
find
the
ninety
a
very
hard
time
to
deal
with
.
the
basic
gag
,
that
of
power
'
total
inability
to
cope
with
the
ninety
,
be
not
so
much
exhaust
during
the
course
of
the
movie
as
never
even
really
deal
with
.
the
bulk
of
the
movie
be
take
up
with
dumb
joke
of
several
basic
rubric
:
jame
bond
gag
-lrb-
of
which
this
movie
have
no
end
,
right
down
to
the
silly
character
name
-rrb-
,
inept
slapstick
,
toilet
humor
,
and
strategically
place
prop
...
the
movie
's
amazingly
bereft
of
idea
,
come
to
think
of
it
,
with
a
couple
of
bright
exception
.
one
be
dr
.
evil
's
son
--
there
be
a
sidesplitting
scene
where
father
and
son
go
to
a
encounter
group
,
chair
by
carrie
fisher
--
and
the
other
be
a
throwaway
gag
where
austin
mimic
various
form
of
transportation
from
behind
a
couch
-lrb-
it
be
a
visual
gag
--
hard
to
describe
,
and
hard
to
recommend
see
the
movie
for
-rrb-
.
a
lot
of
sixty
kitsch
have
be
resurrect
and
throw
on
the
screen
for
this
movie
,
but
it
be
desperate
rather
than
clever
.
instead
of
skewer
the
whole
thing
,
it
be
a
rather
bloodless
and
unfunny
tribute
.
myer
himself
be
also
desperate
:
he
be
give
a
idea
to
play
,
not
a
character
.
plus
,
the
attempt
to
make
the
character
work
by
give
he
a
relationship
with
another
sexy
-lrb-
albeit
''
ninety
''
-rrb-
agent
be
a
waste
of
time
.
i
want
to
have
the
movie
end
with
he
try
yet
again
to
get
it
on
with
she
,
only
to
have
she
deck
he
one
.
with
a
couple
of
exception
,
the
movie
miss
all
of
its
own
best
moment
.
the
movie
even
look
cheesy
,
and
not
in
a
good
way
:
i
keep
wonder
if
it
have
be
transfer
down
from
hi-def
video
or
something
,
so
grainy
be
the
film
stock
in
a
good
many
scene
.
the
whole
thing
have
the
air
of
be
do
on
the
cheap
.
my
definition
of
comedy
be
simply
:
do
it
make
I
laugh
?
the
few
time
that
i
laugh
in
austin
power
be
completely
offset
by
the
time
i
spend
cringe
and
want
out
.
the
most
damning
thing
i
could
say
about
the
movie
be
that
wayne
and
garth
would
most
likely
have
shove
it
into
mike
tyson
's
shorts
and
send
it
sailing
.
