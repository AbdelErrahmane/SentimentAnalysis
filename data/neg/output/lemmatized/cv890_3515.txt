to

most
annoying
trend
in
filmmaking
in
the
last
decade
,
and
it

no
sign
of

it
be
not
just
the

quality
of
you
twenty-cuts-per-minute
editing

the
numbing
over-use
of

and
one-dimensional

serve
only
as
the
vehicle
for
a
performance

that
be
better

than
it

one
night
,
jim
graduate
from
inhalant
to
cocaine
,
and
shortly
thereafter
to
heroin
.
jim
's
addiction
to
the
drug
start
he
on
a
downhill
spiral
,
as
he

kick
off

and
pedro
,
jim
become
a
victim
of
the
street
,
live
from
fix
to
fix
and
sink
lower
and
lower
.
the
basketball
diary
have
be
bounce
around
as
a
project
for
year
,
but
the
sticking
point
have
always
be
that
jim
carroll
as
a
character
be
too
unsympathetic
and
too
much
a
loner
.
screenwriter
bryan
goluboff
create
the
three
character
who
act
as
carroll
's
posse
,
result
in
a
jim
carroll
who
be
just
as
unsympathetic
,
but
now
with
equally
unsympathetic
friend
.
as
a
film
,
the
basketball
diary
may
be
intend
primarily
as
a
cautionary
tale
,
a
100
minute
long
''
just
say
no
''
public
service
announcement
,
but
as
drama
it
be
monumentally
ineffective
because
it
be
impossible
to
care
much
about
anyone
in
the
movie
.
jim
be
sort
of
a
jerk
even
before
he
become
a
junkie
,
but
i
suppose
that
he
pseudo-sensitive
poetry
and
he
devotion
to
he
terminally
ill
friend
be
intend
to
balance
that
out
.
perhaps
we
be
expect
to
see
jim
as
one
of
those
''
good
kid
who
fall
in
with
the
wrong
crowd
''
that
every
parent
believe
he
or
she
troubled
child
to
be
;
i
see
he
simply
as
part
of
the
bad
crowd
.
without
a
character
who
change
in
any
appreciable
way
,
the
basketball
diary
rapidly
degenerate
into
a
collection
of
crime
commit
by
jim
and
he
strung-out
cohort
,
all
choreograph
to
a
oppressively
loud
soundtrack
.
director
scott
kalvert
do
not
have
many
scene
with
intrinsic
dramatic
impact
with
which
to
work
,
so
he
substitute
silly
slow-motion
photography
,
self-consciously
funky
camera
angle
and
choppy
editing
.
on
only
one
occasion
,
when
a
steady
pan
around
a
room
where
jim
be
try
to
detox
make
it
appear
that
the
wall
be
close
in
,
be
any
of
the
gimmick
effective
.
mostly
,
they
just
draw
attention
to
how
hollow
the
story
be
.
they
also
do
not
allow
leonardo
dicaprio
's
performance
to
be
as
strong
as
it
could
have
be
.
for
every
impressive
moment
,
like
he
desperate
attempt
to
get
he
mother
to
give
he
money
,
there
be
a
scene
where
kalvert
pull
too
much
of
the
focus
to
he
own
camera
theatric
.
dicaprio
be
most
effective
when
he
be
play
off
other
actor
,
particularly
a
fine
sequence
feature
ernie
hudson
as
a
ex-junkie
who
try
to
help
jim
straighten
out
,
but
kalvert
will
not
let
character
interaction
define
this
story
.
he
want
to
turn
dicaprio
into
a
rock
star
,
shoot
he
in
dramatic
fashion
but
deny
he
the
opportunity
to
do
much
acting
.
at
isolate
moment
,
the
basketball
diary
be
a
fine
showcase
for
dicaprio
's
talent
.
far
more
frequently
,
it
look
like
kalvert
be
try
to
imagine
what
a
long
form
velvet
underground
video
might
have
look
like
.
