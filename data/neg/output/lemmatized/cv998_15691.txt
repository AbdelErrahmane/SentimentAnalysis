there
be
a
time
when
john
carpenter
be
a
great
horror
director
.
of
course
,
he
best
film
be
1978
's
masterpiece
,
''
halloween
,
''
but
he
also
make
1980
's
''
the
fog
,
''
and
1987
's
underrated
,
''
prince
of
darkness
.
''
heck
,
he
even
make
a
good
film
in
1995
,
with
''
in
the
mouth
of
madness
.
''
but
something
terribly
wrong
happen
to
he
in
1992
,
with
the
terrible
comedy
,
''
memoirs
of
a
invisible
man
.
''
somehow
,
carpenter
have
lose
he
touch
,
with
junk
like
he
failed
1995
remake
of
,
''
village
of
the
damned
,
''
to
he
uninspired
1996
sequel
,
''
escape
from
l
.
a
.
''
those
movie
,
however
,
look
like
cinematic
work
of
art
compare
to
he
latest
film
,
''
john
carpenter
's
vampire
.
''
if
i
be
he
,
i
definately
would
not
want
to
put
my
own
name
in
the
title
.
it
be
a
sad
state
of
affair
when
carpenter
can
make
something
as
misguided
and
flatly
write
and
film
as
,
''
vampire
.
''
the
story
be
simple
.
jack
crow
-lrb-
jame
wood
-rrb-
be
a
vampire
hunter
who
,
along
with
one
of
he
partner
,
montoya
-lrb-
daniel
baldwin
-rrb-
,
and
a
prostitute
,
katrina
-lrb-
sheryl
lee
-rrb-
,
survive
a
attack
from
the
master
vampire
,
valek
-lrb-
thoma
ian
griffith
-rrb-
.
since
katrina
be
previously
bite
by
he
,
crow
take
she
along
because
anyone
who
be
bite
by
valek
become
telepathically
link
to
he
until
they
themselves
turn
into
vampire
a
couple
day
later
,
and
crow
be
hope
to
find
he
with
the
help
of
she
.
it
seem
valek
's
mission
be
to
steal
a
black
,
wooden
cross
from
a
roman
catholic
church
that
will
enable
he
to
become
so
powerful
that
sunlight
will
not
destroy
he
.
my
question
be
:
how
many
time
have
we
see
this
same
story
play
out
?
well
,
the
answer
be
just
about
as
many
time
as
a
better
version
of
the
story
have
be
make
.
''
john
carpenter
's
vampire
,
''
sadly
enough
,
be
one
of
the
most
unscary
horror
film
i
have
ever
see
.
in
fact
,
there
be
not
even
one
suspenseful
moment
in
the
whole
105-minute
run
time
.
the
non-stop
vampire
attack
sequence
be
stylelessly
film
,
without
any
interesting
camera
work
,
which
be
usually
a
trademark
of
carpenter
's
.
and
then
we
come
to
the
screenplay
,
which
,
as
far
as
i
can
tell
,
be
nearly
non-existent
.
there
be
no
story
development
,
and
there
be
not
even
a
attempt
to
flesh
out
the
character
.
jame
wood
can
be
a
good
actor
,
but
he
have
nothing
to
do
here
but
to
say
a
couple
of
''
pseudo
''
-
clever
line
of
dialogue
.
daniel
baldwin
have
some
potential
,
but
he
character
come
off
as
be
very
dense
.
and
sheryl
lee
-lrb-
fare
much
better
as
laura
palmer
in
''
twin
peak
''
-rrb-
,
like
all
of
the
female
character
,
play
a
offensive
stereotypical
whore
.
there
be
not
a
ounce
of
intelligence
,
or
excitement
in
,
''
john
carpenter
's
vamire
,
''
which
be
very
disheartening
come
from
a
ex-fan
of
carpenter
's
.
he
have
say
that
he
turn
down
directing
,
''
halloween
:
h20
,
''
because
he
could
not
work
up
any
excitement
for
it
.
and
yet
,
when
ask
about
a
''
vampire
''
sequel
,
he
say
he
would
be
happy
to
do
it
.
i
think
that
be
a
definite
sign
that
carpenter
have
finally
lose
any
trace
of
he
lasting
talent
,
not
to
mention
a
significant
number
of
iq
point
.
