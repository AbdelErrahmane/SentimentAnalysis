we
be
back
in
blade

territory
with
this
one
,
conceptual

robert
longo
's
vision
of
a
william
gibson-inspired
future
where
information
be
the
commodity
to
kill
for
.
front
and
center
be
johnny
-lrb-
keanu
reeve
-rrb-
,
a
''
cyber-courier
''
who
smuggle
datum
via
a
''
wet-wired
''
implant
.
he
be
ready
to
quit
the
biz
and
get
a
portion
of
he
long-term
memory
restore
,
but
,
first
,
he
have
to
finish
one
last
,
dangerous
job
.
.
the
press
problem
in
johnny
mnemonic
be
that
keanu
reeve
seem
to
have
forget
how
to
play
a
action
hero
since
he
stint
on
speed
.
he
be
walk

in
a
forest
of
stiff
that
include
henry

be
in
a
act
category
all
its
own
.
:
-
-rrb-
without
a
believable
performance
between
they
,
all
we
can
do
be
sit
back
and
watch
the
atmosphere
,
which
be
pretty
good
in
place
.
the
vr
sequence
be
way
cool
,
but
the
physical
fx
--
such
as
miniature
and
matte
--
leave
a
lot
to
be
desire
.
watch
out
for
those
bad
blue-screen
!
we
would
not
mind
a
minute
of
johnny
mnemonic
if
the
action
play
better
.
too
bad
the
debut
director
be
not
very
strong
in
this
de
-
partment
.
he
big
finale
be
a
sloppy
,
silly
mess
that
run
twenty
minute
too
long
,
which
be
way
past
the
time
that
most
of
we
