when
a
film
be
produce
on
a
shoestring
budget
by
a
couple
of
hardwork
filmmaker
and
when
it
tell
the
story
of
a
genuine
tragedy
,
the
easy
path
for
a
reviewer
who
hate
the
movie
be
to
give
it
a
pass
.
toss
out
you
usual
objectivity
,
ignore
how
many
time
you
check
you
watch
while
view
it
,
forget
how
unbearable
it
be
to
sit
through
,
and
find
some
meaningless
way
to
compliment
it
.
this
,
of
course
,
will
be
of
no
service
to
you
reader
,
but
at
least
you
'll
avoid
the
hate
mail
from
the
movie
's
fan
.
thus
it
be
with
a
heavy
heart
that
i
review
the
movie
paulina
-lrb-
not
to
be
confuse
with
the
recent
movie
paulie
about
a
talk
parrot
-rrb-
.
direct
by
vicky
funarus
as
a
labor
of
intense
love
-
she
spend
the
last
one
third
of
she
life
on
film
-
the
movie
blend
documentary
footage
with
historic
and
fanciful
recreation
to
relate
the
bitterly
sad
and
true
story
of
paulina
cruz
suarez
.
paulina
be
a
maid
in
vicky
's
household
when
vicky
be
young
.
i
get
to
learn
the
film
's
background
when
i
attend
a
screening
in
which
the
two
woman
who
make
it
be
present
.
for
those
without
such
context
,
the
reaction
to
the
film
may
be
that
it
be
a
parody
of
a
bad
indie
film
.
the
acting
be
amateurish
,
the
story
be
maudlin
,
and
it
have
all
the
visual
appeal
of
a
bad
home
movie
.
grainy
and
overexpose
,
the
movie
,
shoot
on
16mm
film
and
videotape
,
have
little
to
recommend
it
.
confusingly
compose
,
the
movie
jump
about
jarringly
as
it
tell
its
story
.
quite
bloody
at
time
,
the
story
,
full
of
horrific
image
,
seem
design
to
shock
and
repulse
we
.
why
else
would
you
include
a
scene
with
a
completely
nude
and
bloody
8-year-old
paulina
?
another
scene
have
a
teenage
paulina
be
fondle
on
a
bus
by
the
man
sit
next
to
she
.
in
retaliation
,
she
bite
off
part
of
he
finger
.
this
cover
the
both
of
they
in
a
bucket
of
blood
.
the
passenger
on
the
bus
then
view
the
girl
in
they
mind
as
everything
from
saint
to
sinner
.
one
,
for
example
,
see
she
as
a
aztec
priestess
hold
out
a
large
heart
that
she
have
just
cut
from
a
body
.
the
lugubrious
tale
have
paulina
be
rape
and
beat
.
certainly
she
have
to
endure
a
miserable
life
.
but
that
do
not
guarantee
that
a
movie
about
she
will
necessarily
be
good
.
i
feel
trap
in
the
theater
watch
it
.
only
the
opportunity
to
talk
with
the
filmmaker
afterwards
make
the
movie
bearable
.
paulina
run
1
:
28
.
the
film
be
in
spanish
with
english
subtitle
.
it
be
not
rate
but
would
be
a
r
for
violence
and
nudity
and
would
be
acceptable
for
older
teenager
.
