man
,
this
be
one
wierd
movie
.
similar
to
conspiracy
theory
in
that
it
could
not
decide
which
genre
it
be
.
the
first
hour
be
you
standard
stock
alien
clone
,
which
nicely
create
a
eerie
atmosphere
about
the
ship
.
the
last
half
hour
?
this
be
when
the
maker
blow
the
script
out
the
airlock
and
just
decide
-
''
screw
it
,
let
's
just
kill
everybody
''
.
from
then
on
-
forget
sci-fus
...
this
movie
become
100
%
horror
.
what
really
dissappoint
I
about
this
movie
be
that
it
try
to
scare
you
in
entirely
the
wrong
way
.
instead
of
use
clever
trick
or
try
to
build
up
to
a
scare
-
this
movie
just
use
loud
noise
,
sudden
camera
shift
and
short
quick
burst
of
gore
...
yawn
...
everyone
's
see
it
all
before
and
know
when
to
expect
it
.
the
one
thing
that
be
do
well
be
the
lead
up
to
find
out
about
what
happen
to
the
previous
crew
.
there
be
skeleton
lie
around
mangled
and
mashed
,
but
what
do
this
?
then
finally
after
be
painfully
restore
-
the
new
crew
view
the
video
.
the
acting
be
not
too
bad
at
all
...
consider
what
the
actor
have
to
work
with
anyway
,
as
there
be
no
complex
or
interesting
dialogue
to
speak
of
.
there
be
some
very
nice
camerawork
in
certain
sequence
though
,
like
when
the
hull
near
the
bridge
of
the
event
horizon
be
breach
and
the
camera
pan
back
to
follow
specific
object
as
they
bounce
across
the
deck
and
be
suck
out
into
space
.
this
movie
could
have
be
so
much
better
.
it
have
a
good
experienced
cast
who
deserve
more
to
work
with
.
there
be
just
nothing
new
here
that
any
of
we
have
not
see
before
in
alien
or
hellraiser
.
