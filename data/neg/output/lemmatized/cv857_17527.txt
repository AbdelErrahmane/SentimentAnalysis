claire
dane
,
giovannus
ribisus
,
and
omar
epp
make
a
likable
trio
of
protagonist
,
but
they
be
just
about
the
only
palatable
element
of
the
mod
squad
,
a
lame-brained
big-screen
version
of
the
70s
tv
show
.
the
story
have
all
the
originality
of
a
block
of
wood
-lrb-
well
,
it
would
if
you
could
decipher
it
-rrb-
,
the
character
be
all
blank
slate
,
and
scott
silver
's
perfunctory
action
sequence
be
as
cliched
as
they
come
.
by
sheer
force
of
talent
,
the
three
actor
wring
marginal
enjoyment
from
the
proceedings
whenever
they
be
on
screen
,
but
the
mod
squad
be
just
a
second-rate
action
picture
with
a
first-rate
cast
.
