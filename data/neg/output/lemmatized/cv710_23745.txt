wonder
who

the
best
i
could
come
up
with
be
pre-teen

in
this

saturated
era
,
this

's
component
would
have
be
old
hat
even
for
they
.
i
have
to
think
what
attract
such
talent
to
this
film
be
the
lure
of
make
a
good
,
modern
day
b-movie
.
the
key
to
such
a
venture
be
a
certain
depth
and
sincerity
towards
the
material
.
i
feel
no
such
earnestness
.
