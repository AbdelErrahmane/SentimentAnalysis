this
well-conceived
but
ultra
sugary
coming-of-age
film
be
not
for
everyone
,
and
i
include
myself
as
one
of
those
who
find
it
too
sappy
for
my
digestion
.
joseph
cross
-lrb-
joshua
beal
-rrb-
be
a
10-year-old
who
be
sadden
by
the
recent
loss
of
he
grandfather
-lrb-
loggia
-rrb-
to
bone
marrow
cancer
.
loggia
be
wonderful
in
relate
to
the
child
in
such
a
wholesome
manner
,
it
almost
save
this
film
from
drown
in
syrup
.
the
beal
be
like
a
sitcom
idyllic
family
,
where
everyone
be
just
so
nice
and
affluent
,
and
properly
religious
without
be
fanatical
.
the
beal
,
the
father
-lrb-
deni
leary
-rrb-
and
he
wife
-lrb-
dana
delany
-rrb-
,
be
both
successful
doctor
;
julium
stile
play
joshua
's
older
sister
,
needle
she
younger
brother
but
also
show
that
she
really
care
about
he
.
this
be
a
family
seemingly
conceive
in
heaven
,
but
live
in
south
philadelphia
,
send
they
child
to
a
well-run
catholic
school
.
joshua
,
the
protagonist
and
the
narrator
of
this
yarn
,
be
a
handsome
,
sweet
,
intelligent
,
friendly
,
and
endearing
child
,
who
do
well
in
school
,
relate
to
the
nun
and
priest
,
and
talk
politely
to
he
well-meaning
parent
.
all
this
mawkish
interplay
make
it
almost
too
nauseating
to
watch
.
the
plot
arise
when
joseph
have
a
problem
cope
with
the
death
of
he
beloved
grandfather
,
who
promise
to
be
with
he
forever
.
he
answer
be
to
search
for
god
,
pretty
heady
stuff
for
a
youngster
he
age
to
do
,
but
that
be
just
the
way
it
be
,
sometimes
.
this
search
for
god
take
we
nowhere
because
,
as
he
friend
david
-lrb-
reifsnyder
-rrb-
say
,
where
can
you
look
for
he
if
he
do
not
exist
.
now
,
that
be
a
smart
kid
.
but
joseph
look
for
he
in
the
usual
place
,
and
what
better
place
than
to
start
in
the
parochial
school
he
attend
.
one
of
he
teacher
be
the
kind-hearted
sister
terry
-lrb-
rosie
o'donnell
-rrb-
,
who
wear
a
philly
baseball
hat
and
equate
the
jesus
story
with
baseball
,
make
he
the
clean-up
hitter
,
and
in
my
opinion
,
if
she
be
not
a
big
tv
star
,
would
have
a
vocation
as
a
parochial
school
teacher
,
she
be
that
convincing
.
throughout
the
film
,
she
be
save
from
answer
any
tough
-lrb-
sic
!
-rrb-
question
about
god
by
the
bell
,
as
it
ring
to
end
the
class
.
nothing
much
happen
in
the
search
for
god
,
there
be
no
parody
of
the
catholic
school
;
though
a
visit
cardinal
be
find
by
the
boy
not
to
be
able
to
talk
to
god
,
but
this
be
gentle
stuff
,
no
real
criticism
or
search
for
god
be
attempt
.
what
come
next
into
play
be
some
hollywood
hokum
,
which
be
design
not
to
upset
anyone
,
as
joseph
have
a
reassuring
encounter
with
a
real
,
live
angel
,
a
blond
little
boy
he
own
age
and
dress
like
he
in
the
catholic
school
uniform
who
wear
the
innocuous
smile
of
a
goody-goody
.
the
film
end
as
this
angel
-lrb-
!
!
!
-rrb-
tell
he
he
grandfather
be
all
right
.
he
quest
be
end
,
as
apparently
angel
do
not
have
wing
and
be
approachable
;
and
god
,
well
,
...
maybe
that
be
for
another
film
down
the
road
.
this
part
of
the
film
be
the
final
straw
for
I
,
i
could
not
swallow
any
more
goo
.
as
this
film
flop
commercially
,
he
next
one
,
the
sixth
sense
,
pare
down
the
schmaltz
and
come
up
smell
like
a
rose
.
though
if
you
look
through
the
cleverness
of
both
script
,
this
director
be
load
with
hokum
,
all
he
have
learn
how
to
do
,
be
hide
the
hokum
better
.
well
,
god
bless
he
,
if
he
can
do
that
.
this
be
a
nice
family
picture
and
there
be
room
for
it
in
hollywood
.
it
be
just
too
bad
that
it
have
nothing
relevent
or
even
truthful
to
say
about
death
,
child
in
a
parochial
elementary
school
,
or
for
that
matter
,
about
god
.
and
that
family
of
he
,
they
be
too
good
for
word
.
yet
the
film
mean
well
and
its
benign
message
have
its
heart
in
the
right
place
.
for
those
who
want
to
see
something
soft
,
without
a
bite
to
it
,
this
be
the
one
.
