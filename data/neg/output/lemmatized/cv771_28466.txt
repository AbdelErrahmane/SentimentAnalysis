critique
:
angelina
jolie
be
great
in
this
movie
.
there
be
also
about
three
''
action
scene
''
that
be
pretty
cool
to
look
at
in
this
film
.
uhhhhhm
,
unfortunately
the
rest
of
the
movie
suck
!
bad
dialogue
,
generic
sidekick
and
bad
guy
,
a
lame
mystery
,
yoda-esque
moment
with
mumbo-jumbo
be
sprout
about
and
even
some
crappy
cgus
near
the
end
.
all
in
all
,
this
movie
be
not
the
horror
show
that
some
of
the
early
review
have
warn
we
about
,
especially
since
every
other
scene
do
feature
jolie
's
torpedo
beg
to
burst
out
of
she
lucky
shirt
,
but
it
be
quite
the
letdown
nonetheless
,
especially
when
you
consider
the
major
opportunity
that
the
filmmaker
have
here
to
create
a
cool
,
hip
woman
hero
,
base
on
a
popular
video
game
.
i
do
not
know
,
i
guess
you
have
to
put
most
of
the
blame
on
director
simon
west
,
who
do
not
really
tie
the
whole
movie
together
all
that
well
.
the
film
lack
energy
,
a
consistent
pace
and
well
...
a
fun
time
!
i
feel
kinda
depress
while
watch
this
movie
.
all
that
''
father
''
crap
be
horrible
and
the
dialogue
give
to
poor
john
voight
to
recite
be
just
plain
embarrassing
-lrb-
and
i
be
not
even
gonna
mention
he
moustache
...
hehehe
-rrb-
.
why
have
this
shite
in
the
movie
at
all
?
!
?
i
especially
hate
the
scene
in
which
some
ghost-like
figure
,
friend
or
child
would
ramble
on
about
lara
croft
's
father
while
all
the
time
,
i
be
not
give
one
ounce
of
crap
as
to
what
they
be
talk
about
.
i
guess
that
be
call
lack
of
''
character
development
''
,
right
?
that
be
when
a
movie
build
enough
background
into
the
character
on
the
screen
,
so
that
we
could
actually
''
get
into
''
it
and
care
about
they
.
i
do
not
care
about
anyone
in
this
movie
,
and
be
bore
during
most
of
its
''
let
's
explain
why
we
be
do
all
this
gobbledygook
''
moment
.
and
even
though
i
think
that
jolie
kick
some
mighty
ass
-lrb-
damn
,
do
she
look
sexy
blast
those
gun
or
what
?
!
?
-rrb-
,
everybody
else
around
she
be
so
goddamn
boring
!
she
butler
be
a
throwaway
with
no
personality
,
she
side-kick
be
suppose
to
be
funny
but
just
annoy
I
every
time
he
say
the
word
''
bugger
''
-lrb-
and
he
say
it
a
lot
,
trust
I
!
-rrb-
and
all
of
the
so-called
bad
guy
just
spew
one-dimension
!
they
have
no
spark
,
no
energy
amongst
they
,
and
even
though
a
few
of
the
action
scene
in
the
movie
be
cool
-lrb-
see
the
trailer
and
you
'll
know
which
one
i
be
talk
about
-rrb-
,
the
overall
picture
be
lame
and
the
dialogue
and
mystical
bull-crap
just
bury
it
even
further
.
also
,
for
a
movie
that
be
suppose
to
be
about
all
of
these
exotic
location
,
i
be
not
necessarily
impress
by
any
of
its
exterior
shot
,
and
even
less
so
with
its
interior
,
which
all
look
like
they
be
shoot
in
the
same
room
.
mind
you
,
i
will
not
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
it
be
the
''
worst
movie
of
the
year
''
-lrb-
remember
that
i
actually
have
to
go
see
freddie
prinze
jr
.
movie
also
!
-rrb-
,
but
it
be
definitely
the
worst
film
that
i
have
see
during
this
summer
movie
season
-lrb-
of
course
,
it
be
still
early
and
i
be
sure
there
be
a
few
more
garbage
heap
come
down
the
pike
-rrb-
.
skip
this
one
altogether
and
rent
any
of
the
indiana
jone
movie
instead
...
trust
I
,
you
'll
miss
the
boob
but
end
you
night
with
some
rock-solid
porn
and
it
be
all
good
!
