it

rather
easy
to

tuning
out
after
about
twenty
minute
of

with

tedious

it

nor
nearly
as

as
it
eventually
strive
to
be
in
the
film

half

a

and
the

eventually
come
to
a
distinctly
peculiar
arrangement
-

will
agree
to
bankroll
the

's
lifelong
fantasy
,
and
nick
will
fulfill
terry
's
death
wish

this
be
a
promising
premise
,
and
mr
.
taylor
's
film
could
have
go
any
number
of
ambitious
way
from
this
point
,
but
he
instead
choose
to
capitalize
upon
the
obvious
inversion
of
the
character
-lrb-
terry
be
a
repessed
,
mournful
character
who
want
to
die
,
while
nick
be
a
free
spirit
with
a
joie
de
vivre
who
be
die
but
want
to
live
-rrb-
and
take
the
easy
route
out
by
turn
dream
with
the
fish
into
a
typical
lark
where
the
two
character
engage
in
a
series
of
generally
dull
exploit
,
and
where
the
straight-laced
character
learn
to
enjoy
and
ppreciate
life
when
hook
up
with
a
quirky
character
.
this
be
by-the-numbers
plot
,
buddy
movie\/road
movie
redux
.
however
,
dream
with
the
fish
be
most
hamper
not
by
its
uninspired
storyline
,
but
by
the
character
which
carry
the
story
-
it
help
in
such
a
film
to
have
at
least
one
of
the
protagonist
be
at
least
somewhat
empathetic
,
if
not
likeable
.
unfortunately
,
that
be
not
the
case
here
,
where
both
of
the
film
's
lead
character
be
thorougly
uninteresting
and
annoying
,
give
the
audience
very
little
to
sympathise
with
they
respective
plight
,
and
even
less
reason
to
want
to
follow
they
onscreen
exploit
.
far
from
a
romp
,
this
fatal
flaw
make
dream
with
fish
more
like
a
chore
to
endure
than
a
playful
jaunt
,
and
undermine
the
attempt
at
emotional
resonance
in
the
latter
stage
of
the
film
as
the
two
man
begin
to
bond
.
mr
.
taylor
's
dialogue
sporadically
fall
flat
in
dream
with
the
fish
-
while
attempt
to
capture
a
quirky
and
clever
tone
,
it
too
often
come
across
instead
as
hopelessly
contrived
-lrb-
witness
such
line
as
''
you
should
have
ask
something
more
interesting
,
like
`
do
you
enjoy
the
pain
?
'
-
see
,
that
be
provocative
,
leave
room
for
further
question
.
''
-rrb-
the
film
enjoy
a
few
inspired
moment
-
the
urn
scene
,
a
session
of
nude
bowling
,
the
policeman
join
in
on
terry
and
nick
's
acid
trip
-
but
unfortunatetely
these
instance
be
few
and
far
between
,
and
for
the
most
part
the
humor
in
dream
with
the
fish
register
more
as
attempt
rather
than
actual
success
.
this
occur
particularly
often
during
the
film
's
opening
sequence
-
as
terry
be
wrestle
the
bedridden
nick
for
he
watch
in
the
hospital
,
i
be
realize
that
this
be
\*
intend
\*
to
be
funny
,
although
nary
a
smile
creep
upon
my
lip
-
which
be
probably
due
to
the
obvious
fact
that
it
be
painfully
clear
to
the
audience
from
the
outset
that
terry
be
go
to
be
thwart
in
he
initial
suicide
attempt
,
sap
any
element
of
surprise
or
amusement
from
nick
's
scheme
of
trick
he
;
this
be
not
a
film
which
have
the
wherewithal
to
kill
off
its
lead
star
in
the
opening
ten
minute
.
the
entire
sequence
be
,
then
,
clearly
a
exercise
for
character
exposition
,
with
attempt
at
humor
terribly
diminish
by
utter
predictability
.
among
the
cast
,
come
off
best
be
david
arquette
,
the
current
master
in
the
portrayal
of
meek
,
squirm
,
stammer
fresh-faced
character
-
he
would
have
be
terrific
as
the
lead
for
george
huang
's
swimming
with
shark
-
who
get
to
apply
he
adeptness
for
timidity
as
terry
.
mr
.
taylor
ambitiously
employ
a
interesting
visual
technique
,
where
the
portion
of
the
film
set
in
a
urban
environment
have
be
process
to
appear
extremely
grainy
and
heavily
saturated
,
as
oppose
to
a
bright
,
crisp
look
for
the
smalltown
scene
.
the
charge
of
dream
with
the
fish
's
protagonist
be
wholly
unempathetic
be
a
bit
of
a
odd
one
come
from
I
;
i
seem
to
have
a
predilection
for
film
with
unlikeable
character
,
and
indeed
,
in
many
case
have
i
be
in
the
minority
,
support
film
which
have
be
condemn
as
interminable
due
to
the
difficult
,
audience-unfriendly
nature
of
they
character
.
for
dream
with
the
fish
,
though
,
i
do
find
myself
on
the
flip
side
of
coin
,
often
hope
that
the
film
would
quickly
conclude
,
and
that
the
nick
character
would
just
hurry
up
and
die
.
