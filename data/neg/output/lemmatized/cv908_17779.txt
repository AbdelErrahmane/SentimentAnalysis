teenager
have
a
lot
of
power
in
hollywood
.
every
year
countless
film
will
be
make
target
that
audience
in
particular
,
and
rely
on
the
entire
teenage
population
to
turn
out
on
Friday
and
Saturday
night
,
wallet
in
hand
.
the
formulum
be
very
simple
,
you
make
a
film
with
a
big
name
young
actor
or
actress
with
sex
appeal
.
you
add
a
high
school
environment
that
feature
everyone
from
prom
queen
to
math
club
nerd
,
and
then
a
very
simple
relationship
conflict
that
can
be
work
out
in
90
minute
,
the
typical
teenage
attention
span
.
the
response
be
enormous
as
this
part
of
the
population
will
waste
it92
money
on
almost
any
=
film
set
in
a
environment
they
can
relate
to
,
and
,
most
importantly
,
they
don92t
care
to
judge
film
=
92
quality
,
so
any
piece
of
trash
will
=
due
.
that
be
just
what
never
be
kiss
,
the
latest
film
from
director
raja
gosnell
,
be
;
trash
.
josie
geller
-lrb-
draw
barrymore
-rrb-
be
the
youngest
copy
editor
in
the
history
of
the
chicago
sun
time
.
she
have
she
own
personal
assistant
,
unlimited
supplies
,
and
she
own
office
.
but
she
be
very
much
dismayed
with
she
position
in
life
.
there
be
nothing
she
want
more
than
to
be
a
reporter
and
go
out
into
the
field
,
where
she
can
play
a
more
active
role
in
the
chicago
media
.
so
when
a
assignment
be
quite
literally
throw
at
she
out
of
nowhere
,
she
jump
at
it
with
elation
.
constantly
smother
josie
in
the
work
place
be
she
friend
anita
-lrb-
molly
shannon
-rrb-
and
she
amicable
superior
,
gus
-lrb-
john
c
.
reilly
-rrb-
.
the
two
of
they
be
both
stricken
with
horror
upon
hear
the
news
of
she
first
assignment
,
as
they
both
deem
she
to
be
a
office
worker
and
not
a
reporter
.
however
,
since
this
film
be
aim
at
a
teenage
audience
with
little
patience
for
character
conflict
,
this
otherwise
interesting
scenario
be
resolve
within
two
minute
,
and
josie
be
head
for
the
field
.
obviously
,
the
field
assignment
involve
a
high
school
.
specifically
,
she
be
to
become
a
undercover
reporter
at
a
high
school
,
by
enrol
in
the
senior
class
and
''
become
one
of
they
.
''
i
don92t
think
that
i
=
need
to
even
begin
to
explain
all
the
impossibility
of
this
situation
ever
occur
,
so
i
won92t
.
the
movie
develop
into
josie
try
to
find
the
life
that
she
never
lead
in
high
school
.
interwoven
flashback
scene
show
we
just
how
much
of
a
dork
she
truly
be
,
and
she
appear
to
be
head
down
that
road
again
.
fortunately
for
this
lame
production
,
other
character
do
appear
that
make
some
of
these
high
school
scene
both
humorous
and
remotely
interesting
.
they
include
the
predictable
love
story
,
between
both
a
student
-lrb-
jeremy
jordan
-rrb-
and
a
teacher
-lrb-
michael
vartan
-rrb-
,
to
show
that
josie
be
really
two
people
in
one
body
.
also
,
she
younger
brother
and
opposite
,
rob
-lrb-
david
arquette
-rrb-
come
into
she
new
find
life
and
even
cause
a
rare
scene
that
be
mildly
provocative
.
the
humor
find
in
this
film
be
actually
quite
amusing
.
typical
for
teenage
film
,
it
be
chalk
full
of
sexual
innuendo
and
condom
humor
.
one
scene
in
particular
feature
a
certain
classroom
activity
involve
banana
and
latex
that
be
absolutely
hysterical
.
most
of
the
other
joke
be
straight
forward
high
school
humor
that
anyone
who
have
ever
be
to
high
school
can
appreciate
and
will
enjoy
.
but
those
still
don92t
=
recover
for
the
total
lack
of
quality
in
this
movie
.
follow
this
trend
of
high
school
movie
rule
,
come
the
general
acting
.
it
be
even
worse
than
the
trend
of
overplay
a
scenario
from
film
to
film
.
in
this
case
,
draw
barrymore
be
absolutely
painful
to
watch
.
she
be
require
to
play
she
character
on
two
level
,
have
some
very
black
and
white
transition
.
and
although
some
scene
be
write
to
be
particular
shades
of
gray
,
she
seem
to
hold
that
color
throughout
all
of
she
screen
time
.
at
one
point
she
be
alone
with
a
obvious
love
interest
on
a
ferris
wheel
,
and
be
expect
to
he
on
a
adult
level
,
since
he
be
one
,
she
teacher
.
but
she
never
seem
to
get
out
of
the
gray
area
,
and
in
do
so
she
make
a
mockery
out
of
he
otherwise
good
performance
.
follow
barrymore
be
the
pitiful
molly
shannon
-lrb-
Saturday
night
live
-rrb-
.
she
seem
to
be
limit
to
play
a
ecstatic
character
that
no
one
can
relate
to
,
and
draw
the
attention
of
a
audience
as
simply
unrealistic
.
it
be
these
''
quality
''
that
prevent
the
aforementioned
condom
scene
from
be
one
of
the
few
decent
.
luckily
there
be
one
great
performance
to
emerge
out
of
this
otherwise
bleak
film
.
david
arquette
-lrb-
scream
-rrb-
take
home
the
prize
for
be
able
to
stand
out
in
a
ensemble
performance
that
be
absolutely
pathetic
,
and
not
have
he
brilliant
act
ruin
.
and
as
a
central
character
he
get
to
take
on
he
own
mini-plot
,
which
be
one
of
the
few
well
do
part
of
never
be
kiss
.
in
a
dazzling
cherry-on-the-sundae
type
piece
of
work
,
he
do
a
absolutely
hilarious
tom
cruise
impression
from
the
1983
hit
,
risky
business
.
never
be
kiss
be
a
mediocre
film
at
best
.
the
predictable
plot
have
become
so
overplay
in
hollywood
,
that
it
be
sicken
to
watch
time
and
again
,
and
this
film
be
no
exception
.
the
acting
be
just
as
bad
,
but
there
be
the
one
positive
presence
of
david
arquette
to
add
some
light
.
unfortunately
,
the
bottom
line
be
that
the
movie
will
be
a
success
,
because
teenager
will
pay
to
see
any
trash
.
