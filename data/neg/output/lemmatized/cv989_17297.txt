in
a
typical
cinematic
high
school
,
the
football
jock
have
sex
with
the
girl
and
then
dump
they
,
but
not
before
the
boy
'
score
be
dutifully
record
in
they
little
black
book
.
as
the
sexual
act
take
place
,
the
other
guy
hang
out
nearby
,
guzzle
beer
and
grunt
like
pig
.
in
the
rage
:
carrie
2
,
robert
mandel
's
terminally
bland
sequel
to
carrie
,
there
be
not
a
single
original
moment
.
only
amy
irve
return
from
carrie
,
and
the
talent
of
the
rest
of
the
sequel
's
cast
be
impossible
to
determine
give
the
stupefying
mediocrity
of
rafael
moreu
's
script
.
as
rachel
,
the
horror
story
's
lead
,
emily
bergl
give
one
of
the
least
scary
performance
in
recent
memory
,
but
it
be
not
exactly
she
fault
.
the
director
ask
for
little
from
he
actor
,
which
be
precisely
what
he
get
.
sporadically
in
this
lame
and
lifeless
movie
,
rachel
will
cause
school
locker
and
window
to
fly
open
,
but
generally
she
just
mope
around
look
like
a
victim
.
she
fellow
student
delight
in
torment
she
.
of
course
,
she
will
get
she
revenge
in
the
obligatory
end
bloodbath
in
which
she
will
decapitate
and
castrate
the
boy
and
crush
the
girl
with
burn
timber
.
as
the
movie
mark
time
until
its
big
finale
,
it
throw
in
some
repugnant
scene
,
hope
to
turn
audience
's
stomach
.
rachel
's
girlfriend
commit
a
horrible
and
realistic
suicide
after
the
boy
who
make
''
love
''
to
she
the
night
before
spurn
she
.
-lrb-
he
get
major
point
in
he
black
book
for
this
,
but
he
buddy
say
he
would
have
get
more
if
he
have
have
sex
with
she
after
she
death
.
-rrb-
even
a
helpless
puppy
be
run
over
,
and
we
see
he
poor
,
little
body
flip
over
and
over
under
a
truck
.
the
teenager
in
the
movie
be
completely
bla
?
about
it
all
.
''
do
not
it
offend
you
that
some
girl
off
herself
yesterday
,
''
ask
one
of
the
few
kid
with
a
conscience
.
''
why
?
''
respond
he
nonplussed
girlfriend
.
''
she
be
not
anybody
.
''
remarkably
devoid
of
any
energy
,
especially
for
a
horror
flick
,
the
movie
make
one
yearn
for
a
fast
forward
button
on
the
theater
's
armrest
.
with
material
this
bad
,
the
film
's
only
hope
be
to
go
for
parody
,
but
it
be
not
smart
enough
to
realize
it
.
even
the
mandatory
epilogue
be
as
pointless
and
predictable
as
the
rest
of
the
movie
.
the
rage
:
carrie
2
run
1
:
45
.
it
be
rate
r
for
graphic
violence
,
teen
alcohol
abuse
,
sex
,
nudity
and
profanity
and
would
be
acceptable
only
for
older
teenager
.
