pre-review
note
:
see
as
the
only
concern
of
body
shot
be
''
sex
''
,
i
will
be
force
to
refer
to
that
particular
act
innumerable
time
throughout
the
duration
of
this
review
.
because
of
this
,
i
will
try
to
vary
word
description
of
''
sex
''
-lrb-
mean
if
you
be
offend
by
pejorative
term
,
and
\
or
you
name
be
jerry
falwell
,
you
be
kindly
invite
to
hit
the
x
up
on
the
left
corner
of
you
screen
-rrb-
,
so
if
there
happen
to
be
a
word
you
come
across
and
can
not
comprehend
,
fret
not
,
it
be
most
likely
just
another
way
of
refer
to
''
sex
''
.
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
any
word
use
incessantly
become
a
bit
monotonous
so
i
hope
you
appreciate
my
attempt
to
liven
up
what
could
potentially
be
a
very
boring
review
.
though
not
as
boring
as
the
movie
which
make
steve
forbe
flat
tax
plan
seem
as
lively
as
watch
a
naked
mathew
mconaughy
play
the
bongo
while
high
on
god
know
what
.
body
shot
be
a
film
so
frightened
of
coitus
that
scene
of
copulation
be
film
ominously
,
in
the
way
you
would
normally
expect
to
see
a
violent
attack
.
it
be
about
people
who
think
about
screw
,
seek
it
out
,
and
talk
about
it
.
these
be
thing
we
all
do
,
sometimes
.
the
character
in
this
film
spend
every
wake
moment
ponder
the
simplicity
of
sexual
act
.
they
life
center
around
the
next
sexual
encounter
,
but
they
seem
depressed
.
it
be
as
if
fucking
be
all
they
have
to
look
forward
to
after
a
busy
workweek
.
at
its
core
body
shot
be
a
message
movie
,
the
kind
of
thing
i
could
picture
really
progressive
church
group
show
to
middle
schooler
in
order
to
turn
they
off
coition
.
michael
cristoffer
-lrb-
who
direct
gium
,
another
film
that
treat
bump
ugly
as
if
it
where
evil
-rrb-
be
a
moralist
with
nothing
new
to
say
.
he
character
do
not
communicate
anything
of
interest
to
each
other
,
so
cristoffer
give
they
a
opportunity
to
let
out
they
inner
thought
by
speak
directly
into
the
camera
.
they
voice
simplistic
platitude
like
''
i
like
to
come
''
or
''
sex
without
love
equal
violence
''
.
huh
?
and
yes
that
be
as
complex
as
this
movie
's
observation
get
.
the
character
be
stupid
and
shallow
,
with
not
one
register
as
anything
more
.
the
plot
concern
vapid
over
sexed
twentysomething
on
a
all
night
hunt
for
carnal
pleasure
,
then
the
after
math
-lrb-
the
morning
after
-rrb-
of
such
event
.
we
meet
the
character
as
they
speak
directly
to
we
,
confide
in
we
with
they
idiotic
rumination
on
intimacy
.
i
would
normally
go
into
the
character
and
the
actor
who
play
they
,
give
you
the
pro
and
con
,
but
for
this
film
i
can
not
.
i
be
not
try
to
be
clever
or
witty
,
but
i
honestly
hardly
remember
anything
that
would
set
they
apart
from
the
other
.
with
the
exception
of
trent
-lrb-
play
by
ron
livingston
as
a
bargain
basement
patrick
bateman
-rrb-
,
the
rest
fade
into
each
other
--
a
patchwork
of
fake
breast
,
define
ab
,
pearly
white
tooth
,
and
creamy
,
flawless
skin
.
i
vaguely
recall
brad
rowe
as
the
sensitive
one
,
only
because
he
character
get
the
worst
line
-lrb-
''
sex
without
love
equal
violence
''
-rrb-
.
in
between
all
the
confessional
,
cristoffer
film
everything
like
a
headache
commercial
,
with
blurry
slo
mo
and
dramatic
head
turn
.
the
fact
that
this
director
at
one
point
win
a
pulitzer
prize
completely
baffle
I
.
this
film
be
make
without
one
iota
of
intelligence
or
insight
into
the
generation
that
its
tag
line
claim
to
be
define
.
if
body
shot
be
mean
to
say
that
all
twentysometyhing
be
idiotic
and
f
\*
\*
k-obsessed
,
fine
,
i
do
not
have
any
problem
with
a
film
that
try
to
persuade
I
to
think
a
certain
way
,
but
cristoffer
only
give
we
one
side
.
additionally
that
one
side
be
not
even
entertaining
;
the
character
indulge
in
buggery
without
a
ounce
of
sexiness
.
or
realism
.
one
sexual
encounter
take
place
outside
a
club
on
a
chain
link
fence
between
the
two
most
sensitive
character
.
they
suddenly
have
vigorous
intercourse
with
each
other
for
no
apparent
reason
-lrb-
other
than
that
they
both
happen
to
be
stand
next
to
each
other
?
?
?
alas
,
if
it
could
only
be
that
easy
?
?
?
kidding
of
course
-rrb-
,
then
,
not
only
be
not
it
erotic
,
it
be
not
real
.
it
do
not
feel
like
a
authentic
sexual
encounter
.
every
f
\*
\*
k
scene
in
this
film
-lrb-
and
there
be
many
-rrb-
be
treat
in
the
same
unsexy
manner
.
body
shot
make
fornication
dirtier
than
the
most
scummy
porno
film
.
it
show
we
none
of
the
pleasure
that
should
go
along
with
it
,
and
most
of
all
,
it
fail
to
show
we
why
its
character
love
make
it
so
much
if
they
seem
to
hate
the
act
of
actually
do
it
.
the
result
search
for
nookie
-lrb-
and
you
can
take
that
cookie
?
?
?
-rrb-
over
one
night
leave
we
with
several
tedious
plot
line
to
follow
.
the
main
concern
be
much
ado
over
a
rape
that
may
or
may
not
have
occur
.
the
film
show
we
two
separate
version
of
the
possible
rape
-lrb-
one
where
it
be
consensual
the
other
where
it
be
not
-rrb-
and
in
both
version
the
young
actress
play
the
possible
victim
get
she
shirt
tear
off
.
this
be
a
topic
that
could
be
interestingly
explore
if
do
intelligently
,
and
if
memory
serve
I
i
can
not
think
of
one
film
that
have
do
so
,
and
yes
i
see
the
accuse
which
may
be
one
of
the
most
overrated
movie
of
the
80
's
next
to
wall
street
.
unfortunately
nobody
give
we
reason
to
care
,
not
the
writer
,
the
director
or
the
actor
nearly
all
of
whom
seem
to
have
wander
off
the
set
of
a
noxious
90210
spin
off
.
paul
thoma
anderson
approach
boogie
night
in
a
manner
similar
to
what
cristoffer
do
here
,
though
boogie
night
succeed
.
it
be
similarly
moralistic
,
but
it
give
we
two
different
viewpoint
;
it
show
we
how
the
lifestyle
of
porn
entice
its
character
,
and
it
show
we
the
possible
fall-out
of
such
a
decision
.
the
character
in
boogie
night
be
as
idiotic
as
the
character
be
here
,
but
anderson
seem
to
care
about
they
.
he
give
they
heart
.
cristoffer
give
they
nothing
but
rage
hormone
.
he
preach
to
we
,
by
use
he
character
to
preach
to
we
.
this
be
not
the
way
to
get
any
message
across
.
why
not
just
direct
a
public
service
announcement
on
the
peril
of
hittin
'
skin
?
cristofer
kind
of
do
that
,
though
without
a
ounce
of
insight
,
and
with
a
help
of
leering
exploitation
.
