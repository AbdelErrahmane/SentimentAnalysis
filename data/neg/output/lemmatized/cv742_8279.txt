when
i
be
nine
,
i
start
buy
the
coolest
toy
figure
in
my
local
department
store
.
master
of
the
universe
be
the
pinnacle
of
what
i
be
after
for
action
figure
:
they
combine
science
fiction
and
fantasy
,
have
cool
name
like
mekanek
and
stinkor
and
each
come
with
its
own
little
comic
book
to
read
.
of
course
,
the
animated
series
produce
by
filmation
remain
one
of
the
most
wildly
successful
television
product
in
world
history
.
give
the
tremendous
success
of
the
toy
and
the
cartoon
-lrb-
not
to
mention
its
moderately
successful
spin-off
she-ra
:
princess
of
power
-rrb-
,
it
be
inevitable
that
a
production
company
would
put
two
and
two
together
,
come
with
the
result
of
''
trillion
''
and
make
a
live-action
master
movie
.
let
's
be
blunt
:
master
of
the
universe
be
a
very
bad
movie
.
the
story
be
painfully
dull
and
mind-numbingly
cliched
-lrb-
hand
up
who
\*
would
not
\*
guess
he-man
and
skeletor
take
they
fight
into
the
real
world
-rrb-
and
be
act
out
by
either
incredibly
untalented
actor
-lrb-
dolph
lundgren
as
he-man
for
one
-rrb-
or
good
actor
-lrb-
jame
tolkan
,
meg
foster
-rrb-
give
such
awful
character
and
dialogue
that
they
can
not
help
but
seem
terrible
.
it
be
extremely
clear
that
someone
make
the
movie
want
it
to
be
as
good
as
star
war
.
we
have
the
alien
bounty
hunter
,
the
desert
skif
technology
,
stormtrooper
lookalike
and
a
musical
score
so
reminiscent
of
john
william
that
''
deja
vu
''
be
too
polite
a
term
to
use
in
describe
it
.
''
blatant
uninspired
ripoff
''
would
appear
more
appropriate
.
tv
fan
might
want
to
check
out
courtney
cox
-lrb-
monica
in
friend
-rrb-
and
robert
duncan
mcneill
-lrb-
lt
pari
in
star
trek
:
voyager
-rrb-
,
very
early
in
they
career
and
not
do
to
well
in
they
either
.
so
in
the
face
of
such
mindless
sub-mediocrity
,
be
there
anything
to
make
master
of
the
universe
worth
watch
at
all
?
yes
,
there
be
.
one
incredible
good
reason
.
he
name
be
frank
langellum
.
langellum
have
always
be
one
of
the
underrated
actor
of
hollywood
,
appear
in
countless
film
over
the
year
.
here
he
play
skeletor
,
the
villain
of
the
piece
.
dress
in
opulent
black
velvet
robe
and
bear
a
skull
for
a
face
,
he
be
one
part
darth
vader
,
one
part
emperor
and
two
part
grim
reaper
.
give
this
character
,
langellum
fall
right
into
it
with
style
and
precision
.
skeletor
be
believable
,
interesting
and
manage
to
tread
the
fine
line
between
be
a
homage
to
the
past
and
startlingly
original
in
he
own
right
.
master
of
the
universe
.
i
remember
love
it
when
i
be
eleven
.
at
twenty
one
it
be
difficult
to
see
why
.
but
,
as
i
say
,
it
be
bless
with
a
superlative
villain
who
make
the
entire
thing
worth
the
tedium
of
the
remainder
.
besides
,
this
year
mark
the
film
's
10th
anniversary
.
watch
it
with
some
friend
for
a
good
laugh
and
celebrate
.
