''
the
13th
warrior
''
come
at
the
end
of
as
summer
where
we
have
already
experienced
man
eat
shark
-lrb-
''
deep
blue
sea
''
-rrb-
,
man
eating
crocodile
-lrb-
''
lake
placid
''
-rrb-
and
even
a
man
hunting
witch
-lrb-
''
the
blair
witch
project
''
-rrb-
.
now
,
''
the
13th
warrior
''
present
a
tribe
of
flesh
eat
man
who
believe
that
they
be
bear
.
the
story
,
if
that
be
what
you
want
to
call
it
,
follow
ahmed
ibn
fahdlan
-lrb-
antonio
bandera
-rrb-
a
arabian
poet
who
fall
in
love
with
he
king
's
wife
and
be
banish
from
he
home
land
.
he
then
travel
to
the
land
of
the
viking
and
become
a
ambassador
to
they
.
eventually
the
viking
be
call
upon
to
protect
the
people
of
the
village
who
be
be
hunt
by
the
flesh
eat
man
.
thirteen
warrior
be
choose
to
go
on
the
mission
,
and
as
you
guess
it
,
ahm
be
choose
as
the
thirteenth
.
he
be
not
a
warrior
,
and
at
first
not
well
accept
by
the
viking
,
but
as
the
movie
advance
he
'll
have
to
prove
himself
both
on
and
off
the
battlefield
.
that
be
basically
the
entire
plot
.
there
be
also
a
romantic
subplot
that
have
be
so
badly
mishandle
and
,
one
assume
,
drastically
cut
that
you
begin
to
wonder
why
the
filmmaker
do
not
just
edit
out
all
of
the
scene
attain
to
that
part
of
the
story
.
instead
they
choose
to
leave
just
enough
of
those
scene
in
to
annoy
the
viewer
.
the
film
be
basically
non
-
stop
action
and
when
it
pause
and
try
to
develop
a
story
it
become
a
laughing
stock
.
the
battle
scene
,
although
well
choreographed
,
be
not
involve
and
not
the
least
bit
exciting
.
we
do
not
get
to
know
any
of
the
character
and
so
we
do
not
care
who
live
and
who
die
.
the
film
,
which
want
to
be
beowolf
,
come
across
more
as
a
fail
action-adventure
story
aspire
to
epic
proportion
but
not
achieve
it
on
any
level
.
it
be
direct
by
john
mctiernan
who
be
,
''
the
thoma
crown
affair
''
be
also
play
in
theater
currently
.
and
it
be
not
that
mctiernan
work
simultaneously
on
both
film
but
that
,
''
the
13th
warrior
''
be
place
on
the
shelf
for
so
long
with
the
studio
just
wait
for
a
time
to
dump
it
on
audience
.
it
belong
back
on
the
shelf
.
