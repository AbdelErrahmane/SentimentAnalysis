what
a
contrast
!
in
the
space
of
two
day
,
i
see
shakespeare
in
love
and
hurlyburly
.
i
be
not
sure
you
could
get
two
more
different
movie
.
while
the
former
be
all
over
the
top
,
telegraph
everything
,
shove
its
philosophy
of
life
down
we
throat
,
hurlyburly
be
the
complete
opposite
,
wound
so
tight
and
with
so
much
bury
in
its
script
,
one
could
spend
week
think
about
it
.
this
be
one
interesting
movie
.
it
be
very
much
in
a
similar
vein
to
one
of
my
favorite
movie
of
'98
,
in
the
company
of
man
,
although
not
quite
so
nasty
.
there
be
lot
of
talk
and
some
scary
insight
into
the
world
of
man
.
hurlyburly
doen
'
t
contain
much
plot
:
we
just
follow
eddie
-lrb-
sean
penn
-rrb-
around
as
he
try
to
make
sense
of
he
life
and
the
people
around
he
.
he
big
question
be
:
do
it
all
pertain
to
he
?
and
if
it
do
,
how
be
he
suppose
to
feel
about
it
all
?
''
it
''
mean
everything
:
television
,
friend
,
event
that
happen
.
i
guess
it
could
be
sum
up
more
crudely
as
:
what
be
it
all
about
?
this
be
not
a
movie
for
answer
.
donna
-lrb-
anna
paquin
-rrb-
give
some
but
they
be
not
really
satisfy
:
they
just
lead
to
more
question
.
that
be
what
make
this
movie
stay
on
you
mind
.
these
be
the
sort
of
question
that
occupy
we
time
.
even
when
we
push
they
to
the
background
,
however
we
resolve
these
question
influence
everything
we
do
.
the
performance
be
all
superb
in
hurlyburly
.
i
have
not
see
sean
penn
in
much
before
-lrb-
in
fact
,
i
can
not
remember
see
he
in
anything
-rrb-
,
but
he
be
brilliant
in
this
.
eddie
be
not
a
likeable
character
,
but
sean
penn
make
he
understandable
.
i
do
not
want
to
be
he
friend
but
i
would
like
to
help
he
.
chazz
palminterus
be
also
great
as
phil
,
make
he
a
awful
person
.
i
would
never
want
to
know
phil
but
still
i
understand
why
eddie
want
to
be
he
friend
.
everyone
in
this
film
nail
they
performance
,
make
this
world
real
.
it
be
a
nasty
world
;
it
be
a
sexist
world
.
unlike
shakespeare
in
love
which
be
unfailingly
politically
correct
,
hurlyburly
be
a
man
's
world
,
see
unapologetically
through
the
eye
of
man
.
i
find
this
fascinating
and
on
two
count
,
depress
.
first
,
it
be
depress
that
such
a
world
exist
.
a
large
part
of
hurlyburly
's
success
be
that
it
convince
I
that
such
people
be
real
and
that
this
sort
of
environment
exist
every
day
in
hollywood
;
that
there
be
a
large
number
of
man
out
there
who
believe
woman
to
be
completely
peripheral
to
they
world
,
toy
,
plaything
.
sure
,
everyone
be
background
to
everyone
else
but
in
this
world
,
woman
be
a
long
way
in
the
background
.
second
,
these
be
the
movie
that
be
be
make
:
story
about
man
's
world
.
where
be
the
story
about
woman
's
world
?
not
the
soap
opera
and
the
''
chick
flick
''
that
be
mean
to
satisfy
woman
,
but
the
real
story
that
touch
on
the
essence
of
life
like
hurlyburly
do
for
man
.
hurlyburly
be
base
on
a
stage
play
and
that
be
evident
from
the
moment
the
film
start
.
it
be
very
talkative
,
intelligent
and
static
.
while
this
can
make
the
film
drag
a
bit
,
and
people
sometimes
sound
like
they
be
quote
textbook
,
mostly
this
be
a
good
thing
.
not
all
film
have
to
be
fill
with
special
effect
and
sweeping
panorama
.
not
all
film
have
to
underestimate
the
intelligence
of
they
audience
.
all
it
mean
be
that
hurlyburly
be
probably
just
as
effective
on
video
as
it
be
on
the
large
screen
.
it
also
mean
that
you
have
to
pay
attention
.
