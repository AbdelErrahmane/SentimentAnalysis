i
be
a
steven
seagal
fan
.
i
only
say
this
now
because
''
mufti
splenetik
''
be
not
my
real
name
and
because
i
probably
need
to
explain
why
i
go
into
this
film
expect
great
thing
.
any
proud
seagal
fan
worth
he
bean
will
tell
you
that
the
seagal
formulum
be
something
you
can
depend
on
.
seagal
film
can
always
be
count
on
for
minimal
dialogue
,
heap
of
expendable
baddy
with
extemely
crunchable
bone
-lrb-
which
we
'll
always
hear
when
seagal
do
he
limb-twisting
thing
-rrb-
,
rarely
a
female
co-lead
in
sight
-lrb-
unless
it
be
a
real-life
model-wife
who
have
not
work
since
weird
science
-rrb-
and
,
usually
the
worst
possible
title
you
can
imagine
.
not
to
mention
very
straightforward
plot
,
generally
all-round
bad
dialogue
and
mr
implacable
leather-face
himself
in
that
same
black
outfit
he
be
be
in
since
nico
do
he
''
my
hand
be
sharp
,
nimble
knife
''
thing
,
seagal
the
stoic
,
sir
petrified
ponytail
,
duke
of
dull
.
in
the
glimmer
man
,
seagal
break
out
of
this
formulum
:
he
get
a
\*
sidekick
\*
,
attempt
to
banter
,
and
put
on
a
new
vest
.
he
be
also
put
on
quite
a
lot
of
weight
.
small
potato
,
you
may
say
,
a
man
should
be
able
to
accessorize
and
banter
if
he
want
to
,
but
damnit
,
if
it
be
not
break
,
why
fix
it
?

as

a
homicide
detective
with
a
questionable
past

while
he
and
he

series
of

a
suspect
,
especially
when
a
background
check
run
by

reveal
practically
nothing
on

.
it
turn
out
that
cole
be
a
former
trained
government
assassin
-lrb-
you
just
can
not
trust
these
homicide
detective
-rrb-
,
someone
whom
victim
use
to
catch
just
a
glimpse
of
in
the
jungle
before
he
pounce
on
they
,
and
hence
,
well
,
you
know
,
that
''
glimmer

''
thing
.
a
increasingly
fishy
homicide
investigation
in
the
present
soon
lead
to
the
gradual
uncover
of
a
larger
,
more
threatening
conspiracy
that
involve
a
crooked

,

former
cium
boss
-lrb-
brian
cox
-rrb-
and

involve
chemical
weapon
.
the
glimmer
man
plot
be
pretty
standard
stuff
,
drawing
-lrb-
as
with
he
other
film
-rrb-
element
from
the
hotter
film
of
the
year
-lrb-
eg
,
se7en
-rrb-
.
it
be
the
other
change
that
disappoint
.
for
example
,
although
there
be
a
fair
amount
of
violence
in
this
movie
,
there
be
also
the
disastrous
pairing
of
seagal
with
keenen
ivory
wayan
,
probably
the
best
know
of
the
wayan
tribe
-lrb-
how
many
be
there
,
exactly
?
-rrb-
from

's

brocade-draped

keep
up
he

crazy
''
part
of
the
dialogue
with
waste
zest
.
as
campbell
,
wayan
confines
himself
to
bemoan
he
new
partner
's
eccentric
habit
,
but
the
chemistry
between
the
two
be
minimal
,
and
seagal
's
wooden
comeback
make
for
painful
watching
.
a

,

,
a
benign

trite

plot
device
except
for
the
fact
that
these
new

require
seagal
to

than
usual
.
heck
,
he
have
to
deliver
punchline
and
carry
a
steady
conversation
with
someone
other
than
himself
for
a
large
part
of
the
film
.
be
that
a
lot
to
ask
of
the
seague
?
too
much
.
seagal
's
best
characteristic
use
to
be
that
he
know
he
purpose
in
this
already
complicated
world
of
movie
:
to
crunchily
snap
off
bad
guy
appendage
,
and
to
do
it
silently
,
and
alone
.
not
for
seagal
,
the
snappy
one-liner
of
arnold
and
stallone
,
nor
the
attempt
to
show
that
he
can
act
,
much
less
think
.
no
kindergarten
cop
,
no
oscar
,
just
simple
,
unadulterated
deathblow
.
that
be
really
how
it
must
have
start
:
like-minded
fan
who
know
what
they
want
stream
in
to
watch
the
seague
do
he
thing
,
know
that
never
in
the
seagal
universe
would
they
ever
have
to
see
he
do
anything
else
.
we
trust
he
.
we
get
to
know
he
.
now
,
betrayal
.
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
watch
another
seagal
movie
without
that
little
niggling
doubt
that
he
be
go
to
try
to
be
funny
again
.
i
'll
try
,
but
it
will
not
be
easy
.
if
you
have
not
watch
the
glimmer
man
yet
,
you
might
want
to
wait
for
the
video
to
come
out
.
it
be
easier
to
just
fast
forward
the
dialogue
part
and
linger
on
the
action
sequence
.
after
all
,
if
we
can
not
depend
on
we
fantasy
,
what
can
we
depend
on
?
the
fly
inkpot
rating
system
:
\*
wait
for
the
tv2
broadcast
.
\*
\*
a
little
creaky
,
but
still
better
than
stay
at
home
