in
the
continuation
of
warner
brother
's
franchise
,
joel
schumacher
have
successfully
kill
this
cash
cow
.
what
make
this
film
such
a
grand
disappointment
be
the
tremendous
line
up
of
talented
people
involve
with
the
film
.
avika
goldsman
's
screenplay
be
such
a
cluttered
mess
that
there
be
no
suspense
build
from
one
scene
to
another
.
this
come
on
the
heal
of
such
a
marvelously
write
project
as
''
the
client
''
be
such
a
shock
that
it
give
rise
to
thought
that
the
latter
film
be
a
fluke
.
situation
be
develop
and
execute
with
no
thought
of
reason
other
that
to
get
the
character
from
one
point
to
another
.
this
be
most
glaringly
bring
to
point
by
the
appearance
of
alicium
silverstone
's
batgirl
,
who
just
happen
to
be
alfr
's
niece
.
the
story
of
dr
.
victor
freeze
be
tell
almost
completely
in
dialogue
as
a
afterthought
.
while
work
on
a
cure
for
a
tragic
decease
contract
by
he
wife
,
dr
.
freeze
be
injure
during
a
cryogenic
procedure
,
and
become
a
man
who
can
only
survive
in
a
sub
zero
environment
.
now
of
course
he
have
become
a
terrorist
intent
on
turn
the
world
into
a
frozen
planet
where
only
he
can
live
.
now
the
logic
of
that
little
sub-plot
escape
I
.
if
mr
.
freeze
want
to
find
a
cure
for
he
wife
and
bring
she
back
from
the
brink
of
death
,
why
would
he
want
to
have
she
live
in
a
world
with
no
warmth
.
this
be
indeed
a
cold
hearted
man
.
the
development
of
poison
ivy
be
no
less
contradictory
.
she
want
to
breed
a
form
of
plant
life
that
can
defend
itself
like
a
animal
.
she
join
with
mr
.
freeze
in
he
plan
to
start
a
new
ice
age
,
destroy
all
animal
life
,
therefore
give
she
plant
creation
no
reason
to
have
the
defense
mechanism
she
have
be
try
to
breed
into
they
.
the
character
have
no
logic
.
batman
of
course
be
no
longer
the
dark
knight
of
the
earlier
film
.
now
that
he
have
a
adoptive
son
in
burt
ward
\/
robin
,
bruce
wayne
be
try
to
be
a
father
figure
,
constantly
spout
out
homily
about
family
and
relationship
,
while
at
the
same
time
not
really
have
any
.
george
clooney
try
in
vain
to
keep
from
roll
he
eye
while
recite
the
dialogue
give
he
.
to
say
that
he
performance
be
workman-like
be
to
be
generous
.
he
best
performance
be
still
on
''
e
.
r
.
''
.
bruce
wayne
have
the
most
unromantic
evening
with
he
girlfriend
-lrb-
play
by
elle
macpherson
-rrb-
,
that
it
bring
into
question
bruce
's
latent
homosexuality
.
there
be
no
spark
and
no
passion
-lrb-
as
there
be
for
nicole
kidman
's
psychologist
in
''
batman
forever
''
-rrb-
between
bruce
and
anyone
other
than
alfred
.
and
even
that
relationship
be
very
reserve
.
robin
come
off
less
charismatic
that
in
the
last
film
in
the
series
.
now
he
be
just
a
spoil
kid
.
in
''
batman
forever
''
,
burt
ward
want
to
be
batman
's
partner
and
friend
.
now
,
robin
be
suffer
from
ego
deficiency
.
robin
's
attraction
for
poison
ivy
be
not
believable
,
except
for
a
boy
around
the
age
of
15
.
he
later
flirtation
with
batgirl
smack
of
incest
,
even
though
they
be
not
relate
in
a
traditional
sense
.
chris
o'donnell
,
once
consider
a
rise
star
,
successfully
burn
up
on
reentry
with
this
performance
.
he
robin
need
nothing
more
than
a
good
spanking
.
the
less
say
about
alicium
silverstone
's
performance
the
better
.
this
talented
young
actress
read
she
line
with
all
the
aplomb
of
a
dub
actor
for
a
godzillum
film
.
she
be
cast
strictly
for
she
commercial
value
and
she
know
it
.
this
bring
we
to
the
villain
.
arnold
scharzenegger
walk
through
he
part
with
all
the
concern
of
someone
wait
for
payday
.
the
most
rediculous
scene
be
during
mr
.
freeze
's
imprisonment
.
the
guard
be
at
least
a
foot
taller
that
arnold
and
yet
fall
at
he
hand
in
one
of
the
most
unbelievable
fight
scene
catch
on
film
.
it
be
almost
as
ludicrous
as
see
michael
jackson
as
a
gang
member
.
umu
thurman
strut
and
coo
she
way
through
she
part
,
show
a
grow
discomfort
with
she
sex
symbol
status
.
she
poison
ivy
have
all
the
come
hither
sex
appeal
of
may
west
in
''
sextette
''
-lrb-
1978
-rrb-
.
the
only
performance
worthy
of
notice
be
pat
hingle
and
michael
gough
.
these
two
seasoned
veteran
carry
they
scene
with
a
dignity
sorely
lack
from
the
rest
of
the
film
.
without
go
through
the
intricacy
of
the
plot
,
there
be
one
question
that
always
come
to
mind
with
this
series
-lrb-
except
for
the
first
''
batman
''
-rrb-
,
and
that
be
how
do
these
super
villain
manage
to
hire
so
many
thug
only
to
abandon
they
at
the
final
reel
.
mr
.
freeze
be
introduce
with
a
team
of
hockey
playing
hoodlum
that
seem
to
have
step
out
of
a
old
kiss
music
video
.
every
villain
-lrb-
even
the
minor
one
-rrb-
have
to
have
a
look
,
no
one
can
be
a
individual
with
day
glow
paint
on
they
face
or
some
sort
of
elaborate
costume
.
with
this
film
,
warner
brother
have
succeed
in
retrograde
the
series
back
to
it
be
tv
incarnation
.
the
only
thing
miss
from
the
action
scene
be
the
superimpose
title
detail
the
pow
!
,
gwaaaa
's
,
and
clang
's
associate
with
the
old
series
.
you
almost
wonder
if
william
dozier
,
producer
of
the
tv
series
be
collect
royalty
from
this
film
.
the
special
effect
-lrb-
by
john
dykstra
-rrb-
and
production
design
-lrb-
by
barbara
ling
-rrb-
be
the
primary
star
of
this
film
.
and
it
be
a
case
of
extravagance
in
the
pursuit
of
nothing
.
every
set
,
from
ivy
's
lair
,
the
batcave
,
to
freeze
's
hideout
be
set
with
enough
neon
and
fiberglass
to
keep
the
epa
in
paperwork
for
year
to
come
.
there
be
no
one
realistic
set
or
set
piece
in
the
film
.
everything
be
set
for
maximum
exposure
.
the
special
effect
have
that
strange
cartoon
look
that
most
rush
cgi
effect
have
.
there
be
homage
throw
in
by
dykstra
and
he
team
to
gene
warren
and
he
work
on
''
the
time
machine
''
-lrb-
the
grow
plant
scene
-rrb-
but
these
scene
be
so
wroth
with
glare
color
and
art
that
they
be
almost
obscure
.
joel
schumacher
have
direct
the
film
with
no
flair
.
camera
angle
be
poorly
choose
rehash
set
up
from
the
old
tv
series
.
master
shot
pepper
the
action
scene
,
destroy
any
flow
of
kinetic
quality
they
may
have
have
.
mr
.
schumacher
be
a
good
director
.
one
just
have
to
look
back
on
the
film
''
the
lose
boy
''
,
''
cousin
''
-lrb-
a
underrated
film
-rrb-
and
''
the
client
''
to
know
that
.
but
''
batman
and
robin
''
come
off
as
a
mate
make
for
tv
movie
.
the
film
have
no
style
of
individuality
.
it
be
the
cinematic
equivalent
to
jell-o
,
pretty
to
look
at
,
but
empty
.
it
be
unfortunate
that
this
film
,
even
with
it
be
surprisingly
strong
box
office
have
succeed
in
do
what
warner
's
thought
tim
burton
would
do
with
the
franchise
.
kill
it
.
joel
schumacher
's
''
batman
&
robin
''
be
loud
,
colorful
,
action
pack
,
and
ultimately
.
.
boring
.
star
.
