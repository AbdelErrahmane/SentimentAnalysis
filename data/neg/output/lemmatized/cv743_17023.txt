in
''
gium
''
,
angelina
jolie
play
the
titular
character
,
the
first
so-called
supermodel
.
and
right
there
you
have
the
biggest
hurdle
this
movie
have
to
overcome
-lrb-
in
my
eye
,
anyway
-rrb-
.
i
just
do
not
see
how
the
life
of
a
model
be
worthy
of
a
two
hour
film
.
despite
this
,
i
keep
a
open
mind
when
i
begin
watch
the
movie
.
sadly
,
though
,
my
fear
be
realize
.
it
be
just
not
possible
to
make
a
interesting
,
full-length
film
about
a
person
who
spend
they
day
wear
different
clothes
.
the
movie
follow
the
rise
and
fall
of
gium
-lrb-
no
last
name
-rrb-
,
a
tumultuous
woman
who
do
not
particularly
enjoy
the
world
of
fashion
.
she
become
famous
more
quickly
than
she
can
handle
,
and
find
herself
hook
on
drug
and
on
a
woman
she
can
not
have
.
the
last
hour
of
the
film
be
just
one
scene
after
another
of
gium
get
high
,
lose
a
job
,
and
go
into
rehab
.
this
formulum
be
repeat
several
time
,
and
i
really
get
tire
of
it
.
in
general
,
i
tend
to
dislike
movie
feature
heavy
drug
use
.
no
because
it
offend
I
or
anything
like
that
;
it
just
bore
I
.
quite
frankly
,
i
do
not
see
the
appeal
,
so
when
a
director
show
I
a
point-of-view
shot
of
a
junkie
,
complete
with
tipsy
camera
angle
and
echo
voice
,
i
be
leave
somewhat
unimpressed
.
the
first
hour
of
the
film
,
though
,
be
actually
quite
engaging
.
we
see
gium
as
she
be
discover
and
move
to
new
york
with
she
boyfriend
.
these
early
scene
be
interesting
.
we
be
show
the
fashion
world
through
a
newcomer
eye
,
and
it
be
a
perspective
i
have
not
see
before
.
the
movie
begin
to
go
downhill
,
however
,
once
gium
become
a
established
model
.
-rrb-
from
that
point
,
i
lose
all
interest
in
the
movie
and
be
count
the
minute
before
it
would
end
.
it
all
seem
so
excessive
.
fine
,
so
gium
have
a
drug
problem
,
do
this
really
need
to
dominate
the
film
?
could
not
the
same
effect
have
be
have
with
a
five
or
ten
minute
montage
of
scene
feature
gium
experiment
with
drug
?
or
perhaps
this
film
be
mean
to
be
a
warn
to
aspire
model
not
to
get
into
the
drug
world
.
quite
possibly
,
although
since
i
have
no
desire
to
become
a
model
,
this
warning
be
lose
on
I
.
as
i
state
at
the
beginning
of
this
review
,
i
simply
do
not
see
how
the
life
of
a
model
be
worthy
of
a
feature-length
motion
picture
.
what
do
they
do
that
warrant
a
movie
?
strut
they
stuff
for
thousand
of
dollar
a
hour
?
i
suppose
the
same
could
be
say
about
make
movie
about
baseball
player
,
for
example
,
but
at
least
somebody
like
lou
gehrig
lead
a
interesting
life
.
gium
do
not
.
and
by
the
end
of
the
film
,
all
i
know
about
gium
for
sure
be
that
she
hate
modelling
,
be
bi-sexual
,
and
be
heavily
into
drug
.
not
exactly
a
meaningful
contribution
to
society
,
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
.
