one
of
these
day
,
i
'll
make
good
on
my
promise
never
to
rent
another
abel
ferrara
movie
.
king
of
new
york
and
body
snatcher
notwithstanding
-lrb-
and
bad
lieutenant
be
only
fit
for
a
single
,
emotive
viewing
-rrb-
,
he
exploitation
flick
have
fall
into
a
rut
of
hoary
art-house
trappings
.
it
be
a
perfume-drenched
,
coke-addled
visit
to
the
seedy
pornography
shop
,
where
beautiful
model
-lrb-
no
,
hooker
--
no
,
courtesan
-rrb-
usher
you
through
the
silk
curtain
.
ferrara
's
only
consistently
smart
move
have
be
cast
christopher
walken
over
and
over
again
,
since
walken
can
make
a
good
movie
great
and
a
loathsome
movie
durable
whenever
he
be
onscreen
.
he
8-minute
scene
in
the
addiction
be
the
save
grace
of
that
otherwise
abysmal
,
unwatchable
,
and
pretentious
failure
.
when
he
start
talk
about
he
vampiric
bowel
movement
,
or
question
whether
lili
taylor
have
ever
read
naked
lunch
,
there
be
a
much-needed
dose
of
humor
in
a
otherwise
terminally
unfunny
affair
.
you
know
those
gothic
club
kid
who
be
too
cool
to
smile
and
let
you
know
they
be
actually
have
fun
?
the
addiction
be
that
movie
.
walken
,
sadly
,
do
not
appear
in
the
blackout
.
the
central
role
of
matty
,
a
junkie
film
star
whose
lightning
pace
hollywood
life
among
the
beautiful
people
be
inevitably
lead
to
he
destruction
,
be
play
by
matthew
modine
-lrb-
who
take
what
he
can
get
after
cutthroat
island
-rrb-
.
much
like
the
protagonist
of
michelangelo
antonionus
's
terminally
bored
cultural
elite
,
matty
be
involve
in
a
bitter
pill
''
relationship
''
with
high
fashion
model
annie
-lrb-
at
least
i
think
she
be
a
model
.
-rrb-
matty
's
lady
be
play
by
french
actress
b
?
atrice
dalle
,
arrest
twice
for
cocaine
possession
during
film
of
the
blackout
--
not
that
you
need
to
know
that
,
but
it
lend
credence
to
the
idea
that
ferrara
's
entire
oeuvre
have
be
film
in
a
fucking
blackout
.
no
kidding
.
requiem
for
a
dream
have
nothing
on
the
junkie
presentation
see
in
ferrara
's
movie
and
he
controversial
urban
lifestyle
.
matty
and
annie
struggle
over
she
decision
to
have
a
abortion
without
consult
he
.
no
doubt
,
he
be
off
chase
the
dragon
.
in
he
despair
,
matty
indulge
in
a
chemical
induce
weekend
of
debauchery
,
tooling
around
the
street
of
miamus
with
video
filmmaker
mickey
wayne
-lrb-
denni
hopper
,
in
full
''
dirty
ol'
man
''
mold
smack
model
on
the
ass
and
tell
they
to
spread
they
leg
.
wider
!
-rrb-
toward
the
end
of
the
night
,
they
pick
up
a
teenage
waitress
also
name
annie
-lrb-
sarah
lassez
-rrb-
,
start
shoot
a
hastily
improvise
sexual
scene
,
then
matty
thankfully
black
out
.
something
happen
that
night
which
haunt
he
throughout
the
rest
of
the
movie
,
and
it
be
exactly
what
you
think
it
be
.
suffice
to
say
,
there
be
some
confusion
over
whether
he
kill
annie
one
or
annie
two
,
or
anyone
at
all
.
the
blackout
be
typical
ferrara
:
no
plot
to
speak
of
,
plenty
of
raunch
,
and
horribly
vogue
image
of
matthew
modine
down
a
bottle
of
jack
daniel
and
a
beer
while
wrap
himself
in
a
see-through
curtain
in
he
hotel
room
by
the
sea
,
by
the
sea
,
by
the
beautiful
sea
.
cinematographer
ken
kelsch
find
inconsistent
glory
in
alternate
gorgeous
painterly
sunset
with
docu-style
sleaze
-lrb-
and
we
be
back
to
dennis
hopper
leer
at
girl
in
bathing
suit
.
''
yeah
!
!
!
yeah
!
!
!
arrrghhh
!
''
say
mr
.
hopper
.
dirty
old
sod
.
-rrb-
it
be
compulsive
viewing
in
a
tacky
sort
of
way
,
lead
to
a
ridiculous
climax
where
modine
seize
control
of
he
destiny
.
how
's
that
for
cryptic
?
never
fear
--
ferrara
find
time
for
some
female
full
frontal
nudity
to
remind
we
what
he
be
all
about
.
i
can
picture
it
now
.
''
take
off
yer
clothes
,
kid
--
it
be
essential
to
depict
the
inner
maelstrom
of
my
central
protagonist
,
and
you
be
he
visual
id
.
you
be
the
soul
,
the
heart
,
the
bloodstream
of
the
picture
.
take
it
off
!
take
it
all
off
!
!
!
ha
ha
ha
!
''
friggin
'
vampire
.
yeah
,
you
,
ferrara
.
a
final
word
about
matthew
modine
:
he
be
actually
a
fine
actor
when
properly
cast
,
but
there
be
something
too
squeaky-clean
in
he
demeanor
.
he
be
ideally
suit
for
sarcastic
man
in
tightly
control
situation
,
such
as
he
private
joker
in
full
metal
jacket
or
the
time-bomb
nebbish
in
short
cut
-lrb-
who
be
every
bit
as
superb
as
julianne
moore
in
that
famous
scene
,
though
no
one
seem
to
notice
he
-rrb-
.
-lrb-
he
be
in
that
scene
?
-
ed
.
-rrb-
here
,
he
be
ask
to
let
it
all
hang
out
,
sport
a
three-day
stubble
and
oily
bang
.
he
throw
around
furniture
like
stanley
kowalskus
,
but
it
be
somehow
lack
.
modine
lack
the
feral
intensity
of
brando
,
entirely
miscast
in
ferrara
's
flesh
fair
.
better
luck
next
time
,
matt
.
someday
,
you
'll
be
forgive
for
cutthroat
island
,
which
be
not
really
you
fault
in
the
first
place
.
maybe
atom
egoyan
will
find
a
place
for
you
somewhere
,
and
all
will
once
again
be
well
in
you
world
.
