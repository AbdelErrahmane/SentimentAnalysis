the
original
babe
get
my
vote
as
the
best
family
film
since
the
princess
bride
,
and
it
be
sequel
have
be
get
rave
review
from
most
internet
critic
,
both
siskel
and
ebert
sighting
it
more
than
a
month
ago
as
one
of
the
year
's
finest
film
.
so
,
naturally
,
when
i
enter
the
screening
room
that
be
to
be
show
the
movie
and
there
be
nary
another
viewer
to
be
find
,
this
notion
leave
I
puzzle
.
it
be
a
rare
thing
for
a
child
's
movie
to
be
praise
this
highly
,
so
would
not
you
think
that
every
parent
in
the
entire
city
would
be
flock
with
they
kid
to
see
this
supposedly
''
magical
''
piece
of
work
?
a
tad
bewildered
,
but
pleased
to
not
have
to
worry
about
scream
kid
and
other
disruption
that
commonly
go
along
with
family
film
,
i
sit
back
for
97
minute
and
watch
intently
and
with
a
very
open
mind
,
have
great
expectation
for
the
film
.
look
back
,
i
should
have
take
the
hint
and
leave
right
when
i
enter
the
theater
.
believe
I
;
i
want
to
like
babe
:
pig
in
the
city
.
the
plot
seem
interesting
enough
;
after
the
event
that
take
place
in
the
original
,
babe
the
sheep-pig
have
become
a
legitimate
national
phenomenon
.
but
after
a
fateful
encounter
with
a
water
well
,
arthur
hogget
-lrb-
jame
cromwell
,
who
the
movie
could
have
use
alot
more
of
-rrb-
have
be
render
bed-ridden
for
a
number
of
week
and
the
farm
begin
to
go
under
financially
.
the
only
solution
that
he
wife
-lrb-
magda
szubanskus
,
go
from
delightfully
charming
to
downright
annoying
-rrb-
can
come
up
with
be
to
make
a
appearance
with
they
new
celebrity
pet
at
a
national
fair
-lrb-
i
think
-rrb-
and
to
use
the
money
they
earn
to
pay
off
the
bank
-lrb-
set
aside
for
the
moment
the
fact
that
they
could
get
more
than
enough
cash
from
donation
if
they
just
make
they
case
know
to
the
public
-rrb-
.
problem
be
,
the
fair
be
be
hold
in
the
middle
of
the
dread
''
city
''
,
a
completely
foreign
place
to
both
the
pig
and
he
companion
.
set
the
main
plot
in
motion
,
mr
.
hogget
and
babe
travel
to
the
unnamed
city
and
shack
up
with
a
sweet
lady
who
just
happen
to
love
to
help
animal
,
despite
the
law
that
you
can
not
keep
they
in
hotel
.
it
be
here
that
we
meet
a
array
of
eccentric
character
,
the
most
memorable
be
the
family
of
chimp
lead
by
steven
wright
.
here
be
where
the
film
take
a
wrong
turn
.
up
until
this
point
,
i
have
be
have
a
rather
enjoyable
experience
.
the
beginning
feature
some
smart
writing
and
funny
situation
involve
the
farm
animal
from
the
first
one
and
even
a
inspired
moment
at
the
airport
where
mr
.
hogget
be
accuse
of
smuggling
drug
.
unfortunately
,
the
story
wear
thin
as
we
be
introduce
to
a
new
set
of
animal
that
reside
at
the
hotel
,
none
of
they
be
even
one-tenth
as
interesting
as
the
character
from
the
previous
babe
.
the
main
topic
of
discussion
surround
babe
:
pig
in
the
city
be
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
be
to
dark
and
disturbing
for
small
child
,
and
i
believe
it
be
.
at
one
point
,
a
dog
be
hang
from
he
neck
and
slowly
start
to
drown
.
at
other
time
,
we
be
treat
to
surrealistic
flash-back
to
mr
.
hogget
's
full
cavity
search
at
the
airport
.
in
fact
,
the
overall
tone
of
the
movie
be
rather
bleak
and
depressing
.
however
,
that
be
,
as
they
say
,
neither
here
nor
there
because
kid
will
probably
not
like
the
movie
anyway
.
the
animal
character
and
they
plight
be
simply
not
intriguing
enough
to
sustain
my
interest
for
a
hour
and
a
half
,
let
alone
entertain
a
child
.
another
problem
i
find
with
the
film
be
it
be
sudden
change
of
pacing
and
tone
near
the
end
of
the
story
.
if
you
be
go
to
make
a
darker
and
more
sinister
sequel
,
fine
.
it
may
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
,
but
at
least
it
be
a
noble
ambition
.
but
to
go
from
the
downbeat
feel
of
the
rest
of
the
movie
and
all
of
a
sudden
have
slapstick
finale
with
mr
.
hogget
swinging
from
wall-to-wall
of
a
ballroom
in
elastic
overalls
?
it
just
do
not
feel
right
and
be
more
painful
to
watch
than
it
be
funny
or
entertaining
,
and
the
same
go
for
the
rest
of
the
movie
.
