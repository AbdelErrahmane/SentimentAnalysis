cruise
,
where
we
be
introduce
to
the
ensemble
of
people
who
will
soon
be
the
only
passenger
leave
alive
.
let
's
see
,
there
be
the
new
age
preacher
-lrb-

who
advise
people
to
''

and
to
round
out
the
group
:
the
elderly
couple
-lrb-
jack

and
shelley
winter
-rrb-
who
live
aboard
the
ship
,
the
beautiful
teenage
girl
and
she
brother
who
be
sailing
alone
and
adventurous
scotsman
roddy
mcdowall
.
we
get
to
know
these
people
a
little
too
well
in
the
first
thirty
minute
of
the
poseidon
adventure
,
before
straight
-
face

captain
leslie
nielson
look
in
horror
at
the
giant
tidal
wave
head
right
for
the
ship
.
everyone
be
in
the
giant
ballroom
at
the
time
,
shortly
past
midnight
of
the
new
year
,
when
the
ship
turn
first
on
its
side
,
then
completely
upside
down
.
the
second
-
in-command
want
everyone
to
wait
in
the
ballroom
until
help
arrive
,
but
rebel
hackman
lead
he
small
band
of
follower
on
a
quest
to
the
top
of
the
ship
.
in
this
case
,
because
the
ship
be
overturn
,
the
top
be
the
bottom
.
or
be
the
bottom
the
top
?
either
way
,
we
get
to
see
a
lot
of
bottom
because
the
two
beautiful
woman
in
the
crew
be
both
conveniently
wear
hot
pants
during
the
scene
where
the
camera
shoot
upward
while
they
climb
up
ladder
and
--
in
the
ballroom
scene
--
christmas
tree
.
thus
begin
a
hour
or
more
of
hushed
trip
down
long
corridor
,
through
burn
room
,
etc
.
while
the
ship
slowly
fill
with
water
behind
they
.
it
be
a
race
against
the
clock
which
be
only
mildly
interesting
.
the
poseidon
adventure
work
more
as
a
bad
movie
to
laugh
at
,
with
all
the
melodrama
that
come
in-between
the
non-thrilling
action
scene
.
the
one
note
in
borgnine
's
one-note
performance
be
to
be
a
cranky
old
man
that
argue
with
hackman
every
step
of
the
way
while
button
and
the
hippie
fall
in
love
-lrb-
although
since
there
be
not
a
sex
scene
,
we
never
find
out
if
he
button
really
be
red

albertson
and
winter
wonder
if
they
'll
live
to
