''
it
be
not
scary
.
''
these
be
the
first
word
that
come
to
mind
after
it
be
over
.
when
a
movie
be
call
_
vampire
_
,
''
not
scary
''
be
not
word
that
should
be
associate
with
it
.
but
that
be
not
my
only
gripe
.
john
carpenter
be
a
name
associate
with
cutting-edge
cinema
,
as
in
the
intense
scare
of
_
halloween
_
,
_
the
thing
_
and
_
the
prince
of
darkness
_
,
or
the
offbeat
action
of
_
they
live
_
and
_
escape
from
new
york
_
.
unfortunately
,
the
only
thing
that
be
cut
edge
about
_
vampire
_
be
the
level
of
boredom
the
movie
be
able
to
reach
.
with
a
anemic
plot
and
not-quite-kosher
special
effect
,
_
john
carpenter
's
vampire
_
have
barely
enough
substance
to
slake
the
thirst
of
even
the
least
discerning
genre
fan
.
the
film
be
at
first
concern
with
a
group
of
roam
vampire
slayer
,
lead
by
jame
wood
,
of
all
people
.
like
some
sort
of
holy
a-team
-lrb-
they
even
have
they
own
souped-up
van
-rrb-
,
the
bunch
invade
and
wipe
out
a
nest
of
vampire
in
a
new
mexico
shack
.
they
method
be
amusingly
innovative
:
the
blood-sucker
be
reel
out
with
harpoon
so
they
can
flare
up
in
the
sun
like
matchstick
.
to
commemorate
they
victory
,
the
loutish
band
decorate
a
motel
room
with
hooker
and
party
the
night
away
.
they
celebration
be
short-lived
,
however
,
as
a
master
vampire
name
valek
ambush
and
single-handedly
destroy
most
of
the
team
.
wood
'
jack
crow
and

-lrb-
daniel

-rrb-
escape
with
they
life
,
along
with
a
woman
name
katrina
-lrb-
sheryl

-rrb-
.
although
the
woman
have
be
bite
,
montoya
and
crow
decide
to
keep
katrina
for
she
psychic
link
to
the
master
vampire
.
the
rest
of
the
movie
be
concern
with
the
boy
'
hunt
for
valek
-lrb-
thoma
ian
griffith
-rrb-
,
a
freaky
marilyn
manson-type
who
be
on
a
mission
that
date
back
600
year
.
along
the
way
they
pick
up
a
priest
name
guiteau
-lrb-

-rrb-
,
a
character
who
serve
pretty
much
the
same
purpose
as

jittery

in
_
saving

ryan
_
.
some
stuff
happen
in
the
middle
of
the
movie
,
but
i
can
not
remember
most
of
it
,
because
i
often
find
a
twitch
hair
in
the
corner
of
the
frame
more
interesting
than
what
be
happen
on
screen
.
_

_
finally
start
to
pick
up
about
90
minute
into
the
mix
,
as
crow
,
guiteau
,
and
montoya
assault
a
abandon
prison-turned
vampire
nest
.
only
then
do
the
film
begin
to
even
resemble
a
carpenter
flick
.
but
it
be
too
little
too
late
.
we
get
the
inevitable
final
confrontation
,
but
it
seem
tack
on
and
rather
anti-climactic
-lrb-
come
on
,
we
be
deal
with
_
the
_
master

!
-rrb-
interestingly
,
last

_
be
derive
from
a
comic
book
,
and
_
vampire
_
from
a
novel
,
yet
the
latter
seem
more
steep
in
campy
cheesiness
than
the
former
,
a
more
deliberate
superhero
flick
.

jack

spout
glib
off-the-cuff
one-liner

away
from

with
that
oh-so-cool

and
he
motive
for

take
a
wild
guess
.
-lrb-
hint
:
a

-rrb-
at

_

_
have
decent
action
and
slick
stylishness
.
_
vampire
_
lack
even
cheap
thrill
to
mask
its
gossamer-thin
plot
.
to
make
up
for
this
,
the
movie
resort
to
other
''
shock
,
''
such
as
its
generally
condescending
attitude
towards
woman
-lrb-
crow
slap
they
around
for
the
fun
of
it
-rrb-
and
a
overplay
contempt
for

guiteau
incessantly
about
whether
he
vow
of
celibacy

he
prone
to

''
-rrb-
it
can
be
argue
that
maybe
i
want
too
much
from
this
movie
.
if
not
scary
and
gory
,
i
want
tense
,
relentless
,
and
exhausting
.
_
john
carpenter
's
vampire
_
be
none
of
these
.
i
can
only
recommend
it
for
the
hardcore
carpenter
fan
.
for
the
rest
of
you
look
for
a
good
scare
,
beware
:
_
vampire
_
be
a
film
with
no
tooth
.
