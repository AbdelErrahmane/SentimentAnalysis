instantly
rescue
the
moribund
career
of
its
trio
of

eight
year
later
,
moore
and
goldberg
's
career
be
not
exactly
thrive
,
but
they
have
have
they
share
of
screen
success
since
;
the
same
can
not
be
say
of
swayze
,
who
have
just
add
yet
another
turkey
to
he
resume
with
the
aptly
name
black
dog
.
forget
the
mortal
kombat
movie
--
this
trucksploitation
flick
be
the
closest
the
movie
have
come
to
video
game
.
good
truck
driver
jack
crew
-lrb-
swayze
-rrb-
must
drive
a
cargo
of
illegal
firearm
from
atlanta
to
new
jersey
.
along
the
way
,
jack
and
he
crew
of
three
run
into
a
number
of
obstacle
--
such
as
a
highway
weigh
station
,
evil
trucker
,
and
deadly
uzi-firing
motorcyclist
.
every
so
often
,
like
at
the
end
of
a
video
game
''
level
''
or
''
stage
,
''
the
main
baddie
pop
up
:
red
-lrb-
meat
loaf
,
fresh
from
the
triumph
of
spice
world
-rrb-
,
who
want
to
steal
the
cache
of
gun
.
just
in
case
you
forget
he
name
or
have
trouble
keep
track
of
who
be
drive
what
,
all
of
red
's
vehicle
,
be
it
a
pickup
or
a
big
rig
,
be
paint
--
you
guess
it
--
red
.
i
could
go
into
more
of
the
plot
specifics
-lrb-
such
as
jack
's
dream
of
have
a
nice
home
with
he
family
,
the
past
trauma
that
send
he
to
prison
and
cost
he
he
trucking
license
,
the
fbi\/atf
crew
track
the
cargo
-rrb-
,
but
they
be
of
little
importance
.
all
that
matter
to
director
kevin
hook
and
writer
william
mickelberry
and
dan
vining
be
the
obstacle
jack
confront
in
he
drive
from
point
a
to
point
b
.
but
they
fail
at
even
this
modest
goal
,
for
none
of
the
highway
chaos
,
as
credibly
stage
as
it
be
,
be
terribly
interesting
,
let
alone
exciting
.
once
you
have
see
a
couple
of
truck
bang
against
each
other
or
a
big
rig
explode
the
first
time
,
you
have
see
it
every
time
.
as
dreary
as
black
dog
be
as
a
entertainment
,
the
saddest
part
about
the
film
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
show
up
onscreen
;
it
be
that
swayze
have
to
reduce
himself
to
such
work
.
while
far
from
the
best
of
actor
,
he
be
certainly
not
horrible
,
and
he
be
a
charismatic
presence
.
i
do
not
know
if
it
be
he
judgment
or
the
dearth
of
quality
job
offer
that
lead
he
to
involve
himself
with
bomb
such
as
black
dog
.
regardless
,
if
he
continue
on
this
career
track
,
could
a
tv
series
be
far
behind
?
