a

-rrb-
while
the
extremely
peculiar
a
life
less
ordinary
do
live
up
to
its
title
,
a
more
appropriate
moniker
would
be
a
movie
more
misguided
,
for
this
confused
,
confusing
attempt
at
romantic
comedy
be
a
most
disarm
disaster
from
the
talented
trainspotting
team
of
director
danny
boyle
,
producer
andrew
macdonald
,
and
screenwriter
john
hodge
.
at
the
core
of
this
strange
film
be
a
fairly
basic
--
and
,
yes
,
ordinary
--
premise
.
after
robert
-lrb-
boyle
regular
ewan
mcgregor
-rrb-
,
a
aspiring
writer
of
trashy
novel
,
be
fire
from
he
janitorial
job
at
the
naville
corporation
,
he
kidnap
naville
's
-lrb-
ian
holm
-rrb-
spoil
daughter
celine
-lrb-
cameron
diaz
-rrb-
and
hold
she
for
ransom
.
the
joke
here
be
that
celine
be
a
willing
victim
--
she
father
threaten
to
cut
she
off
financially
,
so
she
want
revenge
--
and
that
she
soon
become
not
only
a
accomplice
but
the
brain
behind
the
scheme
,
teach
the
inept
robert
a
thing
or
two
about
kidnapping
...
and
,
ultimately
-lrb-
do
not
we
see
this
one
come
?
-rrb-
,
love
.
so
far
,
so
mediocre
.
but
mediocre
be
better
than
dreadful
,
which
this
film
be
,
thanks
in
no
small
part
to
the
hodge
's
contextual
frame
for
the
romance
.
it
turn
out
that
god
be
displeased
with
the
divorce
and
romantic
breakup
rate
on
earth
,
so
the
chief
of
heaven
's
police
,
gabriel
-lrb-
dan
hedaya
-rrb-
dispatch
two
angel
,
o'reilly
-lrb-
holly
hunter
-rrb-
and
jackson
-lrb-
delroy
lindo
-rrb-
,
to
earth
to
hook
up
celine
and
robert
--
or
lose
they
angel
status
.
this
conceit
might
have
work
if
the
angel
dimension
play
a
integral
role
in
the
entire
picture
.
but
it
could
have
easily
be
cut
without
any
clear
loss
to
the
film
;
as
it
stand
,
it
be
simply
a
waste
of
time
that
distract
from
the
romance
at
hand
.
not
that
there
be
much
of
a
romance
to
begin
with
.
try
as
diaz
and
mcgregor
may
,
celine
and
robert
be
too
one-note
to
become
very
endearing
character
.
celine
be
rich
bitch
;
robert
be
a
dullard
.
as
such
,
it
be
quite
hard
for
the
audience
to
really
connect
with
these
two
--
then
again
,
they
never
seem
to
really
connect
with
each
other
.
when
celine
and
robert
start
to
overtly
act
on
they
''
feeling
,
''
it
come
off
more
like
something
script
than
anything
natural
.
but
i
be
not
exactly
sure
if
boyle
and
company
's
point
be
romance
;
honestly
,
i
be
not
exactly
sure
what
they
be
try
to
accomplish
.
boyle
juice
up
the
visual
with
he
characteristic
razzmatazz
,
but
it
remain
just
that
--
energy
,
not
energy
in
service
of
a
story
or
even
act
.
the
cast
seem
lose
,
especially
hunter
,
whose
performance
be
so
adrift
as
to
be
baffling
.
and
then
there
be
the
many
eccentricity
splatter
onto
the
film
:
some
violent
confrontation
involve
the
angel
,
who
be
not
exactly
angelic
--
in
fact
,
they
end
up
stage
they
own
ransom
scheme
;
some
mystical
hokum
in
the
climax
;
and
a
cutesy
claymation
epilogue
.
watch
much
of
a
life
less
ordinary
be
like
be
trap
in
indie
hipster
hell
,
stockpiling
quirk
in
the
name
of
cool
.
instead
,
the
film
just
give
quirky
a
bad
name
.
my
best
guess
as
to
what
the
filmmaker
want
to
accomplish
be
a
atmosphere
of
warped
womantic
-lrb-
yes
,
misspell
intended
-rrb-
whimsy
,
which
come
through
in
only
one
scene
:
a
extended
musical
number
where
celine
and
robert
sing
''
beyond
the
sea
''
at
a
karaoke
bar
.
after
a
verse
or
two
,
the
couple
be
magically
doll
up
in
snazzy
outfit
and
hairdo
,
and
engage
in
a
spirited
dance
routine
on
the
counter
.
the
scene
work
not
only
because
of
its
relative
simplicity
but
also
because
it
do
not
try
too
hard
,
just
rely
on
the
innate
charm
of
the
lead
,
allow
they
to
build
a
romantic
rapport
.
alas
,
not
nearly
enough
be
build
,
for
this
moment
come
to
a
abrupt
end
.
i
applaud
any
attempt
to
bring
something
fresh
and
unique
to
movie
house
,
but
sometimes
even
cleverness
can
reach
overkill
.
a
life
less
ordinary
certainly
deliver
something
''
different
,
''
but
by
the
time
the
film
be
over
,
i
be
clamor
for
a
life
more
ordinary
.
''
i
can
accept
failure
.
everyone
fail
at
something
.
but
i
can
not
accept
not
try
.
it
do
not
matter
if
you
win
as
long
as
you
give
everything
in
you
heart
.
