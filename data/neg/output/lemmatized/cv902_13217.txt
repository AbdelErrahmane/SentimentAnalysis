there
be
so
many
thing
to
criticize
about
i
do
not
know
where
to
start
.
recommendation
:
turn
off
you
brain
-
do
not
be
like
I
,
decrease
the
rating
everyday
because
i
think
about
it
too
much
.
a
comet
be
about
to
strike
earth
,
cause
a
catastrophe
similar
to
the
extinction
level
event
-lrb-
e
.
l
.
e
.
-rrb-
that
wipe
out
the
dinosaur
.
what
follow
be
the
story
of
a
president
's
bid
to
think
for
the
good
of
he
people
,
a
rise
reporter
,
the
love
story
of
two
teenager
-lrb-
one
of
whom
discover
the
comet
-rrb-
,
and
a
team
of
astronaut
on
the
ship
`
messiah
'
to
save
the
world
.
firstly
,
there
be
nothing
outstandingly
inferior
about
the
making
of
the
film
-lrb-
nor
be
there
anything
outstandingly
good
about
it
-rrb-
,
but
the
plot
hole
make
the
film
corny
and
stupid
.
to
be
honest
,
i
be
more
move
by
the
trailer
than
the
film
itself
-lrb-
which
be
not
say
much
-rrb-
.
mimi
leder
's
follow-up
to
`
the
peacemaker
'
be
equally
incompetent
,
with
all
the
big
star
waste
.
-lrb-
perhaps
i
be
just
annoy
that
the
release
of
`
the
peacemaker
'
in
the
we
overshadow
a
far
superior
thriller
,
`
the
assignment
'
.
-rrb-
it
be
very
obvious
that
the
title
not
only
represent
the
big
boom
that
will
result
from
the
collision
,
but
also
connote
the
heavy
impact
on
human
life
.
however
,
the
film
simply
fail
on
that
note
.
the
effect
be
worn-out
,
the
substandard
screenplay
limit
the
acting
,
and
the
director
continue
she
sad
run
in
term
of
good-film-making
credentials
.
she
be
still
make
good
money
though
.
t
?
a
leonus
's
unfortunate
character
,
the
news
reporter
,
be
the
foundation
of
the
story
and
of
the
cast
.
but
the
film
suffer
from
too
many
character
that
do
not
need
to
be
explore
.
robert
duvall
's
aging
astronaut
be
lifeless
,
and
morgan
freeman
's
president
be
restricted
to
,
well
,
a
righteous
president
-lrb-
which
mean
he
be
not
interesting
at
all
-rrb-
.
leonus
's
character
be
the
only
appeal
one
,
and
be
play
with
reasonable
conviction
-lrb-
but
a
rather
peculiar
show
when
report
for
msnbc
-rrb-
,
but
be
definitely
undervalue
by
the
director
and
screenwriter
.
warning
:
spoiler

but
a
lot
of
it
be
irrelevant
and
predictable
anyway

to
exterminate
more
than
99
%
of
the
human
race
,
and
they
send
eight
puny
little
nuclear

up
there
?
where
's
the
logic
?
leder
could
have
at
least
make
it
plausible
with
20

and
then
it
turn
out
that
only
a
few
percent
of
the
world
population
actually
perish
,
and
those
less
selfish
one
-lrb-
the
one
that
stay

-rrb-
be
the
victim
.
the
film
be
almost
mock
they
,
tell
they
they
have
die
for
nothing
.
i
also
fail
to
see
how
two
teenager
,
carry
a
baby
,
would
be
the
first
to
climb
up
the
mountain\/hill
,
even
with
a
motorbike
for
a
head-start
.
it
be
unlikely
that
the
dust
will
take
just
two
year
to
settle
,
but
that
do
not
really
matter
.
build
cave
be
a
strategy
mention
in
`
dr
.
strangelove
'
,
which
propose
that
people
live
underground
for
one
hundred
or
so
year
.
now
that
be
a
more
practical
use
for
cave
.
what
be
the
point
of
living
in
cave
?
there
be
no
,
unlike
`
dr
.
strangelove
'
,
any
radioactivity
outside
to
restrict
exposure
.
how
do
plant
grow
?
if
human
have
the
technology
to
keep
plant
alive
in
cave
,
there
be
no
reason
why
they
can
not
do
it
in
the
open
.
the
president
disclose
that
other
country
have
be
prepare
they
own
cave
.
obviously
this
mean
that
the
other
country
be
inform
a
long
time
ago
,
and
you
can
not
be
serious
to
say
that
nobody
leak
the
news
to
the
media
.
in
a
important
mission
like
that
of
the
`
messiah
'
,
for
that
matter
any
mission
,
it
be
impossible
that
be
not
sufficient
fuel
for
a
extra
couple
of
hundred
metre
,
needless
to
say
ten
of
kilometre
.
this
be
not
deep
impact
?
it
be
a
frivolous
cheap
impact
.
but
even
with
all
that
,
some
overacting
,
and
a
3
.
4
rating
,
it
be
still
watchable
,
just
do
not
think
about
it
.
okay
?
