mean
this
in
the
worst
possible
way
.
i
know
what
you
do
last

be
a
typical
slasher
flic
without
the
smart
of
the
scream
's
.
as
a
result
,
it
be
even
worse
than
some
of
you
better
campy
horror
picture
-lrb-
see
nightmare
on
elm
street
-rrb-
because
it
think
it
be
about
thirty
time
smarter
than
it
be
.

on
a
teen
book
of
the

and
,
disappointingly
,
adapt
by

williamson
,
i
know
what
you
do
last
summer
begin
with
appropriately
angsty
modern
rock
music
combine
with
some
startling
cinematography
of
a
cliff
along
the
ocean
and
a
angsty
sort
sit
at
the
top
.
the
appropriate
mood
be
set
-lrb-
this
be
angst-horror
for
the
90
's
-rrb-
,
we
cut
over
to
the
July

parade
in
a
small
north
carolina
town
.
from
there
,
we
see

after

drunk
at

,
go
to
a
beach
to
wittily
discuss
urban

and
indulge
in
some
foreshadowing
,
and
have
some
meaningful
sex
-lrb-
if
you
believe
what
the
character
say
-rrb-
,
the
four
run
down
some
guy
cross
the
windy
cliff
road
at
night
.
he
face
be
mangled
so
they
can
not
tell
who
it
be
,
and
they
come
to
the
decision
to
dump
he
in
the
ocean
so
as
to
not
ruin
any
of
they
future
chance
for
success
in
the
world
.
cut
to
one
year
later
.
the
life
of
we
protagonist
have
go
from
annoy
to
bad
.
main
brunette
female
,
the
bright
one
of
the
bunch
,
have
be
plague
with
guilt
and
almost
fail
out
of
college
.
blond
female
have
forfeit
she
dream
of
star
on
guide
light
,
and
now
work
at
the
family
store
in
town
.
brunette
male
be
a
fisherman
,
live
off
the
land
.
blond
male
have
become
a
complete
jerk
and
quarterback
on
some
college
football
team
.
then
,
predictably
,
they
past
come
back
to
haunt
they
.
it
all
begin
with
a
irrational
murder
,
follow
by
some
taunting
of
protagonist
by
the
mysterious
killer
,
bad
act
by
a
good
actress
-lrb-
anne
heche
-rrb-
,
a
improbable
plot
,
bad
act
by
the
main
bad
actor
,
some
more
killing
,
conclude
in
a
climactic
scene
,
mostly
climactic
in
the
relief
at
the
end
of
the
movie
.
all
the
while
,
the
actor
and
actress
spout
off
bad
line
,
and
main
brunette
male
do
he
best
keanu
reeve
imitation
.
not
that
the
movie
be
without
pleasure
.
count
the
illogical
plot
twist
and
bad
line
for
some
fun
.
mostly
,
though
,
note
the
costume
of
main
female
and
how
trendily
unattractive
they
make
the
otherwise
eye-catching
pair
look
.
