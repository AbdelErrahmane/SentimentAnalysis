write
a
screenplay
for
a
thriller
be
hard
.
harder
than
pour
concrete
under
the
texa
sun
.
harder
than
build
a
bridge
over
troubled
water
.
and
incidentally
,
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
harder
than
write
a
movie
review
.
thriller
be
all
variation
on
a
theme
.
you
have
a
smart
,
resourceful
,
and
powerful
bad
guy
,
who
have
a
goal
he
have
to
meet
.
you
have
a
noble
and
brave
good
guy
,
who
have
to
protect
the
innocent
,
kill
the
bad
guy
,
and
not
get
kill
himself
in
the
process
.
the
trick
of
thriller
writing
be
do
all
of
this
in
a
interesting
and
novel
manner
.
this
simple
formulum
can
lead
to
classic
movie
like
north
by
northwest
,
high
noon
,
or
silence
of
the
lamb
,
or
big
summer
blockbuster
like
man
in
black
,
the
fugitive
,
or
air
force
one
,
or
it
can
lead
to
utter
dreck
like
mastermind
,
event
horizon
,
kull
the
conqueror
...
be
anyone
else
get
depress
here
?
point
be
,
it
be
not
enough
to
follow
the
formulum
.
you
have
get
to
throw
in
something
extra
,
something
good
and
new
and
better
than
the
last
version
.
something
to
surprise
and
move
all
of
we
people
who
buy
the
ticket
and
the
popcorn
and
the
happy
meal
.
this
be
a
hard
thing
to
do
,
but
it
be
absolutely
necessary
in
every
way
.
without
that
something
extra
--
whether
it
be
a
great
plot
or
a
well-written
screenplay
,
or
great
special
effect
or
great
location
or
great
casting
or
great
performance
or
great
big
hungry
dinosaur
--
the
movie
fail
.
that
be
why
the
jackal
,
with
all
its
starpower
,
with
all
its
budget
,
with
all
its
hype
,
get
a
big
fat
f
.
bruce
willi
be
the
bad
guy
,
the
jackal
,
a
legendary
killer
for
hire
.
richard
gere
be
the
good
guy
,
a
former
ira
assassin
with
a
vendetta
against
the
jackal
.
the
jackal
be
try
to
kill
someone
.
gere
be
try
to
stop
he
.
will
gere
be
able
to
stop
the
assassination
in
time
and
kill
the
jackal
?
-lrb-
i
'll
give
you
three
guess
,
and
the
first
two
do
not
count
.
-rrb-
there
be
no
surprise
await
the
audience
in
the
jackal
,
no
moment
when
you
say
to
yourself
,
''
i
wonder
what
happen
next
?
''
the
script
for
the
jackal
be
not
rip
straight
from
today
's
headline
.
it
be
rip
off
,
straight
from
a
episode
of
millennium
.
throughout
the
movie
,
we
learn
what
the
jackal
's
plan
be
and
how
he
intend
to
accomplish
they
.
no
surprise
.
the
fun
of
a
movie
like
this
should
come
from
richard
gere
figure
out
what
the
jackal
's
plan
be
and
develop
a
clever
plan
to
foil
the
bad
guy
.
instead
,
we
get
two
-lrb-
count
'em
,
two
-rrb-
scene
where
gere
be
sit
in
a
fbus
conference
room
somewhere
and
instantly
divine
the
jackal
's
plan
just
as
if
he
be
frank
black
-lrb-
or
more
likely
,
just
as
if
he
be
be
hand
a
copy
of
the
script
-rrb-
.
and
we
never
get
more
than
a
superficial
clue
as
to
why
gere
have
have
this
flash
of
insight
.
it
be
like
gere
's
character
be
psychic
,
but
neither
he
nor
the
fbus
-lrb-
or
the
screenwriter
-rrb-
seem
to
know
it
.
and
just
like
in
millennium
,
the
bad
guy
have
a
overwhelming
need
to
go
after
the
people
the
good
guy
care
about
,
whether
or
not
they
be
important
to
what
he
be
try
to
do
or
not
.
what
be
more
,
in
the
last
half
of
the
movie
,
the
jackal
,
supposedly
a
super-smart
professional
terrorist
who
never
make
a
mistake
,
come
down
with
a
major
case
of
the
stupid
.
as
for
the
performance
...
bruce
willi
manage
to
get
through
the
whole
movie
without
a
wisecrack
,
which
be
a
major
achievement
,
but
not
enough
reason
to
see
the
movie
.
he
disguise
be
good
,
but
not
as
good
or
as
interesting
as
val
kilmer
's
in
the
saint
.
richard
gere
be
make
to
talk
the
entire
movie
in
a
irish
accent
,
which
detract
from
he
otherwise
lifeless
and
dull
performance
.
sidney
poitier
be
probably
the
most
disappointing
element
in
a
overwhelmingly
disappointing
movie
--
not
that
he
performance
be
bad
or
anything
,
it
be
not
,
but
it
be
sad
that
hollywood
will
not
use
this
talented
actor
in
any
part
other
than
a
fbus
agent
-lrb-
shoot
to
kill
,
sneaker
-rrb-
.
write
a
good
plot
and
a
good
screenplay
,
like
i
say
,
be
hard
,
but
it
can
be
do
.
it
be
not
do
here
.
it
be
we
job
as
consumer
to
reward
good
screenplay
and
to
denounce
bad
and
uninteresting
one
.
do
not
go
see
this
movie
.
you
'll
only
encourage
the
producer
to
make
more
just
like
it
.
instead
,
stay
home
and
rent
day
of
the
jackal
,
or
in
the
line
of
fire
,
or
a
fire
safety
video
,
for
cry
out
loud
.
anything
other
than
the
jackal
,
which
live
up
to
its
name
by
gnawing
the
dead
bone
of
other
,
better
movie
.
