the
kid
in
the
hall
be
a
acquire
taste
.
it
take
at
least
a
season
of
watch
they
show
on
hbo
before
i
become
a
believer
.
maybe
after
watch
a
half
dozen
kid
in
the
hall
movie
,
they
would
grow
into
the
big
screen
.
my
recommendation
be
that
,
unless
you
be
a
big
fan
of
the
kid
,
skip
the
film
.
as
it
be
,
they
first
--
and
most
likely
only
--
attempt
at
a
full
length
film
lack
the
quality
that
make
they
comedy
work
on
tv
.
a
big-budget
and
glossy
production
can
not
make
up
for
a
lack
of
spontaneity
that
permeate
they
tv
show
.
the
kid
go
through
the
motion
,
but
you
get
the
feeling
that
they
arent
really
have
fun
do
so
.
and
this
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
audience
to
enjoy
they
antic
.
brain
candy
be
a
bunch
of
skit
tie
together
by
the
story
of
a
pharmaceutical
company
that
develop
a
new
drug
to
cure
depression
.
in
typical
sketch-comedy
tradition
,
each
actor
play
several
role
.
doctor
cooper
-lrb-
kevin
mcdonald
-rrb-
and
he
team
create
the
drug
.
then
,
under
pressure
from
don
roritor
-lrb-
mark
mckinney
-rrb-
,
founder
and
president
of
roritor
pharmaceutical
,
dr
.
cooper
release
the
drug
into
the
marketplace
.
the
ensue
distribution
of
the
new
happy
pill
throughout
the
populace
drive
the
rest
of
the
film
.
at
about
90
minute
,
brain
candy
still
seem
long
.
the
best
thing
about
sketch
comedy
--
and
the
kid
be
no
exception
--
be
the
ability
to
quickly
deliver
the
laugh
,
then
go
on
to
another
quick
skit
.
but
with
the
additional
set-up
necessary
in
tell
a
longer
,
coherent
story
,
the
laugh
just
dont
come
fast
enough
.
strangely
,
the
show
be
even
more
tame
than
it
be
when
on
cable
tv
.
the
movie
make
several
attempt
at
risqueness
--
mostly
by
point
up
the
gayness
of
one
of
scott
thompson
character
--
but
they
seem
almost
force
;
as
if
they
have
to
live
up
to
a
pg
rating
.
one
of
the
best
bit
,
though
,
do
make
use
of
thompson
naked
buttock
;
we
see
he
charge
into
battle
--
go
to
have
sex
with
some
guy
take
a
shower
.
in
the
classic
of
this
genre
,
monty
python
pull
off
this
delicate
balancing
act
between
plot
advancement
and
punchline
delivery
for
most
of
the
holy
grail
.
the
kid
,
unfortunately
,
be
not
up
to
the
task
.
there
be
some
amusing
moment
,
to
be
sure
,
but
not
enough
to
make
the
experience
a
enjoyable
one
.
