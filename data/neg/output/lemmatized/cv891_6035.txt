the

be

director
walter
hill
give
the
proceedings
he
usual
injection
of
steroid
,
include
a
pair
of
gun
for
willi
which
have
the
ability
to
propel
a
assailant
backward
with
sufficient
thrust
to
achieve
escape
velocity
,
but
at
least
he
do
not
try
to
turn
the
story
into
a
slasher
film
or
a
buddy
picture
.
what
he
_
do
_
do
be
nearly
as
big
a
mistake
,
and
that
be
to
provide
a
run
voice-over
narration
by
willi
which
ring
of
the
standard
hard-boiled
style
of
pulp
detective
fiction
.
yes
,
that
narration
be
full
of
cliche
,
but
those
be
be
not
particularly
troubling
.
the
problem
be
that
both
yojimbo
and
a
fistful
of
dollar
succeed
largely
on
the
inscrutability
of
they
lead
character
.
they
be
a
mystery
,
to
the
other
character
in
the
film
and
to
the
audience
,
they
motive
never
entirely
clear
even
after
they
have
act
,
and
that
quality
contribute
to
they
almost
mythical
status
.
with
john
smith
's
voice
chatter
on
in
the
background
and
allow
we
into
he
every
thought
,
he
become
more
mundane
,
just
another
tough
guy
try
to
stay
alive
.
it
feel
like
a
hammett
novel
,
all
right
,
and
hill
can
plead
faithfulness
to
he
text
for
he
choice
,
but
it
simply
do
not
work
.
the
narration
allow
the
man
with
no
name
to
take
we
into
he
confidence
,
and
the
man
with
no
name
take
_
no
one
_
into
he
confidence
.
even
if
you
walk
into
last
man
standing
as
a
blank
slate
,
i
can
not
imagine
it
be
much
more
than
a
heavily
armed
minor
distraction
.
willi
tone
down
he
macho
swagger
as
the
taciturn
smith
,
but
there
be
still
a
level
on
which
he
always
seem
like
he
be
count
on
be
tougher
than
everyone
else
rather
than
smarter
than
everyone
else
.
christopher
walken
play
doyle
's
brutal
henchman
as
a
slight
variation
on
he
gallery
of
soft-spoken
psycho
,
and
there
be
not
another
single
character
whom
make
even
the
slightest
impression
.
with
no
compelling
antagonist
for
smith
,
there
be
no
build-up
towards
the
expect
showdown
,
and
when
it
do
come
,
that
showdown
be
over
so
quickly
you
wonder
what
all
the
fuss
be
about
.
cinematographer
lloyd
ahern
-lrb-
who
also
do
the
only
noteworthy
work
on
hill
's
1995
flop
wild
bill
-rrb-
create
some
nifty
sunburned
vista
,
but
he
work
be
only
to
keep
the
eye
distract
between
the
spurt
of
gunfire
and
the
next
bit
of
counter-productive
narration
.
sometimes
when
someone
see
a
lackluster
remake
of
a
revered
original
,
they
'll
wonder
what
all
the
talk
be
about
.
in
the
case
of
last
man
standing
,
it
be
those
who
know
the
original
who
will
wonder
what
all
that
talking
be
about
.
