the
film
may
be
call
mercury
rise
,
but
that
title
do
not
describe
the
trajectory
take
by
this
motion
picture
,
a
routine
thriller
that
combine
government
cover-up
with
a
cloying
and
poorly-motivated
buddy
story
.
the
''
hook
''
that
be
suppose
to
make
mercury
rise
unique
be
that
the
young
protagonist
be
autistic
.
however
,
aside
from
give
actor
miko
hughe
a
chance
to
win
rave
for
he
performance
,
this
particular
aspect
of
the
film
come
across
as
nothing
more
than
a
convenient
plot
device
.
those
expect
to
see
even
a
semi-thorough
exploration
of
the
condition
will
be
disappoint
.
mercury
rise
treat
autism
with
the
same
degree
of
efficiency
that
many
action
thriller
accord
to
alcoholism
.
the
script
for
mercury
rise
be
exceptionally
tiresome
and
hard
-
to-swallow
.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
problem
be
in
the
original
book
,
simple
simon
,
or
in
the
screenplay
adaptation
,
but
this
movie
easily
exceed
the
intangible
threshold
beyond
which
a
suspension
of
disbelief
be
no
longer
possible
.
once
again
,
certain
standby
plot
element
--
the
high-level
government
conspiracy
and
the
maverick
law
enforcement
agent
--
be
recycle
,
and
not
to
good
effect
.
while
bruce
willi
can
play
the
action
hero
as
well
as
anyone
in
hollywood
,
this
particular
outing
leave
he
maroon
in
situation
that
be
characterize
by
too
little
tension
and
too
much
nonsense
.
the
story
begin
with
a
formulaic
sequence
in
which
the
tough
fbus
agent
with
a
heart
of
gold
,
art

when
he

down
by

soon
,
art
and
simon
be
on
the
run
from
seemingly
everyone

flee
for

and
bonding
at
the

time
,
with
the

always
just
a
step
behind

along

why
be

and
why
be
he

turn
into
swiss

by
the
evil
hit

who
look

?
apparently
,
the
government
have
spend
million
of
dollar
develop
a
ultra-secret
code
call
''
mercury

''
to
make
sure
it
can
not
be
crack
,
they
do
the
most
intuitive
thing
possible
:
place
a
sample
of
it
in
a
''
nerd

''
of
course
,
no
one
can
solve
it

no
one
except
autistic
simon

that
be
.
when
he
call
the

result
,
the
cold-hearted

decide
that

have
to
be
eliminate

for

he
have
not

on
the

with
a
heart
of
gold

even
though
everyone
in
the

it
be
hard
to
get
work
up
about
a
routine
thriller
that
do
not
do
anything
exceptionally
well
,
and
do
quite
a
few

rather
poorly

for

as
the
one
where

down
,
avoid

not
that
pulse-pounding
.
the
climactic
struggle
be
a
real
ho-hum
affair
which
lead
to
a
finale
that
be
painful
in
its
obviousness

overall
,
