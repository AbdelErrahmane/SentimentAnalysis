they

i

annoyed

the
lack

ironic

i
begin
to
alleviate
the
boredom
by
consider
how

-lrb-
although
the
notion
now
intrigue
I
-rrb-
,
but
gwyneth
paltrow
,
who
be
originally
in
the
run
for
the
part
and
can
veritably
handle
a
spot-on
english
accent
.
if
nothing
else
,
it
would
at
least
be
highly
entertaining
for
the
incongruous
sight
of
the
vaguely
twiggish
young
actress
kick
butt
.
the
story
,
such
as
it
be
,
involve
the
ever-bemused
tandem
of
steed
and
peel
combate
the
malevolent
sir
August

a
eccentric

superior
,
it
sound
far
better
than
it
play
,
and
be
render
almost
indecipherable
by
blatant
post-production
tinkering
;
it
be
clearly
evident
that
the
picture
have
be
cut
to
shred
.
the
avenger
be
never
about
grip
drama
,
and
we
hero
accordingly
never
take
villainous
sir
August
very
seriously
,
but
give
the
lack
of
cohesion
in
the
plot
and
the
lack
of
menace
convey
by
the
buffoonish
maniac
,
it
be
all
decidedly
uncompelling
.
mr
.
connery
,
who
be
onscreen
barely
long
enough
to
register
a
impression
,
approach
the
role
like
a
man
fulfil
a
contractual
obligation
,
simultaneously
chew
the
scenery
while
unable
to
hide
he
disinterest
.
at
least
it
all
look
good
.
this
be
a
genuinely
handsome
production
,
with
fine
costume
design
by
anthony
powell
and
crisply
shoot
by
roger
pratt
.
in
particular
,
the
gleaming
production
design
by
stuart
craig
command
attention
,
adeptly
draw
element
both
old
and
new
in
order
to
depict
this
great
britain
.
there
be
a
handful
of
striking
visual
moment
in
the
film
,
include
a
attack
by
a
swarm
of
giant
robotic
bee
and
a
nice
shot
of
steed
and
peel
find
a
way
to
walk
on
water
,
but
the
film
be
so
unremittingly
dull
that
even
these
instance
fail
to
stir
interest
or
raise
pulse
rate
.
by
the
time
the
film
's
climax
have
arrive
,
my
interest
be
not
with
the
sight
of
steed
and
sir
August
slug
it
out
amidst
crash
wave
and
thundering
rain
,
but
with
the
quickest
escape
route
from
the
theater
.
not
coincidentally
,
the
entice
bit
of
visual
bravura
be
the
shot
assemble
into
the
movie
's
remarkable
trailer
,
a
savvy
piece
of
work
which
ironically
be
infinitely
more
appealing
that
the
feature
film
itself
;
the
first
promo
which
make
the
round
in
early
spring
be
probably
my
favorite
studio
trailer
so
far
this
year
.
it
be
everything
that
the
avenger
be
not
--
saucy
,
clever
,
engaging
,
and
entertaining
.
a
crush
disappointment
,
the
film
be
one
of
the
worst
outing
of
the
year
--
too
drearily
awful
to
be
savor
as
gleefully
bad
,
too
polish
to
overlook
its
deficiency
.
there
may
be
upcome
picture
that
be
even
more
lifeless
than
the
avenger
,
but
i
sure
hope
not
.
