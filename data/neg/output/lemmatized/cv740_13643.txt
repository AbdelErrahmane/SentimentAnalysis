in
this
year
's
summer
movie
preview
issue
of
_
entertainment_weekly
_
,
theresa
connelly
describe
she
writing-directing
debut
,
_
polish_wedding
_
,
as
''
a
child
that
do
not
quite
become
the
child
i
think
it
would
.
''
one
wonder
what
exactly
she
originally
have
in
mind
for
this
jumbled
film
,
a
comedy-drama
that
appear
doom
at
its
most
basic
element
.
the
family
at
the
center
of
_
polish_wedding
_
be
the
pzoniak
,
which
consist
of
mother
jadzium
-lrb-
lena
olin
-rrb-
,
father
bolek
-lrb-
gabriel
byrne
-rrb-
,
sole
daughter
halum
-lrb-
claire
dane
-rrb-
and
four
son
of
vary
degree
of
facelessness
.
it
be
a
large
family
,
but
there
be
not
a
sympathetic
one
in
the
whole
bunch
,
certainly
not
in
the
primary
trio
.
jadzium
take
pride
in
building
and
maintain
a
home
and
family
,
but
she
be
kind
of
a
hypocrite
since
she
be
carry
on
a
affair
with
a
businessman
rade
serbedzija
-rrb-
.
she
excuse
for
she
affair
be
neglect
from
bolek
,
who
be
such
a
passive
wimp
that
one
can
not
connect
with
he
sadness
and
frustration
.
also
,
how
could
he
possibly
pay
so
little
attention
to
the
saucy
,
sexy
jadzium
?
halum
be
a
spoil
,
self-centered
high
school
dropout
whose
reckless
sexual
experimentation
predictably
lead
to
pregnancy
.
with
such
a
unappealing
set
of
character
,
it
be
no
surprise
that
_
polish_wedding
_
's
plot
complication
be
far
from
involve
.
naturally
,
jadzium
and
bolek
would
like
halum
to
marry
the
young
cop
,
russell
schuster
-lrb-
adam
trese
-rrb-
,
who
father
the
child
,
but
he
refuse
to
make
such
a
commitment
.
ho-hum
.
another
complication
,
involve
the
decidedly
un-virginal
halum
be
select
to
crown
a
statue
of
the
virgin
mary
,
be
first
play
for
laugh
and
then
,
inexplicably
,
as
a
profound
statement
in
the
film
's
climax
--
which
,
ironically
,
be
funnier
than
any
of
the
film
's
lame
attempt
at
humor
,
such
as
a
painfully
labored
slapstick
attempt
where
jadzium
lead
she
son
in
a
charge
to
beat
up
russell
.
that
scene
be
but
one
in
a
number
of
write
miscue
by
connelly
.
the
jadzia-bolek
conflict
be
resolve
in
a
overly
pat
way
not
unfamiliar
to
sitcom
viewer
.
the
hala-russell
conflict
be
not
resolve
in
as
contrived
a
manner
,
but
they
ultimate
resolution
will
leave
viewer
wonder
if
they
have
miss
something
.
and
then
there
be
some
atrocious
dialogue
,
which
i
be
sure
be
not
suppose
to
be
as
ridiculous
as
they
sound
:
''
look
at
all
these
pickle
.
just
look
at
they
give
I
such
great
sadness
.
''
as
misguided
as
_
polish_wedding
_
be
,
the
affair
be
something
of
a
letdown
,
consider
the
strong
performance
by
byrne
,
dane
,
and
especially
the
fiery
olin
.
they
obviously
believe
in
connelly
and
she
material
--
a
faith
that
audience
will
be
hard-pressed
to
share
.
