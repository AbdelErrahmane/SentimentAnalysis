well
i
guess
it
be
that
time
of
the
year
again
.
the
one
time
of
the
year
where
movie
craftor
be
exonerate
from
the
need
to
even
\*
try
\*
write
a
script
that
have
more
dialogue
than
explosion
.
it
be
also
the
best
time
for
the
handful
of
exist
bigtime
hollywood
mr
action
hero
to
dust
off
they
miniscule
vocabulary
,
pull
on
they
black
vest
and
charge
onto
we
screen
tersely
expirate
what
they
hope
will
become
memorable
catchphrase
.
in
america
they
call
this
time
''
summer
''
and
it
happen
once
every
year
.
and
maybe
it
be
the
exposure
to
all
that
nasty
sun
that
do
it
,
but
in
the
process
normally
weak
,
insipid
line
like
''
consider
this
a
divorce
,
''
''
hasta
la
vista
,
baby
,
''
and
''
you
be
the
disease
.
i
be
the
cure
''
actually
do
end
up
be
repeat
more
often
then
the
phrase
from
my
book
of
biblical
proverb
.
this
be
not
entirely
a
bad
thing
,
of
course
.
what
be
i
talk
about
?
i
be
talk
about
the
summer
''
blockbuster
,
''
the
''
action
thriller
,
''
the
''
this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know
-
everyone
's
-
going-to-go
''
explosion
,
gas
threat
,
fly
saucer
,
and
special
effect
.
in
the
rash
of
''
my
,
what
big
gun
you
have
,
but
wait
!
mine
be
bigger
''
movie
,
there
be
also
the
usual
boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment
movie
-lrb-
or
whale
,
whatever
-rrb-
,
and
\*
this
\*
year
,
the
odd
crop
of
''
save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment
-
threat
''
offering
.
i
be
talk
about
the
three
batman
,
the
speed
,
the
terminator
,
etc
.
this
year
i
be
talk
about
twister
,
independence
day
,
the
arrival
,
the
rock
,
mission
:
impossible
,
and
of
course
,
eraser
.
here
in
singapore
,
as
we
local
movie
critic
like
to
whine
,
we
seem
to
get
the
pick
of
the
crop
of
''
my
explosion
be
more
real-looking
than
yours
''
movie
,
but
nothing
else
.
mission
:
impossible
open
in
we
theater
almost
as
soon
as
it
do
in
the
we
.
the
same
go
for
eraser
,
which
be
unfortunate
for
arnold
schwarzenegger
because
come
so
soon
after
what
time
magazine
recently
call
''
mission
:
unavoidable
''
-lrb-
on
account
of
its
worldwide
mega-advertising
blitz
-rrb-
,
eraser
seem
like
a
cheaper
,
less
thoughtful
imitation
.
that
be
say
a
lot
,
because
mi
the
movie
be
already
a
cheap
,
thoughtless
imitation
of
its
tv
originator
of
the
'60s
\/
'70s
.
in
eraser
,
arnie
be
a
we
federal
marshall
who
relocate
trial
witness
whose
testimony
place
they
life
in
danger
.
he
do
this
by
destroy
all
evidence
of
they
present
existence
and
re-situate
they
with
new
identity
.
he
new
case
be
lee
cullen
,
play
by
vanessa
william
who
,
unlike
all
the
other
scumbag
he
be
ever
relocate
,
be
''
a
actual
,
real
life
honest
person
.
''
because
she
be
so
good
,
and
have
such
nice
leg
,
arnold
spend
the
whole
movie
try
to
protect
she
,
and
only
use
the
opening
movie
sequence
to
save
robert
pastorellus
from
\*
he
\*
killer
.
lee
obtain
evidence
that
the
high-technology
weapon
company
she
work
for
be
secretly
sell
sophisticated
,
black-market
arm
to
people
with
foreign
accent
and
stringy
hair
.
of
course
,
as
the
formulum
go
,
she
reveal
this
information
will
destroy
the
system
as
we
know
it
because
heck
,
there
be
people
in
high
place
who
will
go
down
with
this
,
because
yes
,
this
be
the
biggest
conspiracy
in
the
history
of
the
world
-lrb-
that
be
,
america
-rrb-
since
watergate
.
in
protect
lee
,
arnold
be
frame
by
the
mentor-turned-evil
robert
deguerin
,
nicely
play
by
jame
caan
,
and
end
up
have
to
prove
that
he
be
not
the
one
kill
the
program
's
witness
in
addition
to
make
sure
lee
be
not
accidentally
torpedo-ed
to
death
by
the
new
,
green
gun
he
enemy
all
have
.
it
be
around
this
time
that
people
in
the
theater
with
I
start
hum
the
mission
:
impossible
theme
,
because
arnie
's
mission
include
break
into
a
high-security
building
to
run
a
disk
.
i
guess
i
should
tell
you
more
about
the
particular
gun
everyone
in
this
movie
be
so
antsy
about
.
it
be
a
electro-magnetic
pulse
gun
thing
which
fire
aluminium
missile
,
and
which
can
see
through
wall
.
it
have
some
sort
of
x-ray
vision
,
so
its
user
can
target
the
victim
's
heart
even
from
great
distance
.
despite
this
,
which
i
figure
be
a
pretty
cool
feature
in
a
gun
-lrb-
though
i
be
certainly
no
expert
-rrb-
,
however
,
arnold
,
whose
own
heart
be
target
a
number
of
time
,
\*
never
\*
go
fly
10
foot
backwards
with
a
two-foot
missile
through
he
chest
like
all
the
other
who
get
shoot
by
this
gun
.
instead
he
outrun
and
outsmart
he
tracker
each
time
,
give
eery
and
ironic
resonance
to
that
terminator
line
that
practically
make
he
famous
:
''
i
'll
be
back
.
''
like
everyone
else
in
the
theater
,
i
leave
the
movie
feeling
that
the
trailer
have
dupe
I
,
because
they
make
I
want
to
watch
this
movie
voluntarily
.
although
there
be
a
\*
lot
\*
of
violence
in
this
movie
,
not
to
mention
mutilation
and
some
bloody
tussle
with
alligator
,
i
recommend
this
movie
to
most
over-18
who
need
some
therapeutic
mindless
action
to
get
over
the
weirdness
of
fargo
or
the
hangover
effect
of
leave
las
vegas
.
