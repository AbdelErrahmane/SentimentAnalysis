some
movie
ask
you
to
leave
you
brain
at
the
door
,
some
movie
ask
you
to
believe
in
the
impossible
to
really
have
a
good
time
.
play
god
ask
just
one
simple
,
eensy
,
teensy
thing
so
it
can
fully
entertain
you
,
it
be
accomplish
in
just
four
easy
to
follow
step
:
crack
open
you
skull
,
scoop
out
you
brain
,
squish
it
under
you
foot
several
time
and
reverse
step
two
and
one
.
congratulation
,
you
now
have
all
the
necessary
requirement
to
fully
enjoy
a
whole
lot
of
nothing
.
some
movie
fail
at
the
box
office
but
you
manage
to
see
why
the
producer
think
it
could
have
be
a
good
movie
,
other
be
simply
good
idea
that
be
badly
execute
.
then
there
be
playing
god
,
which
enter
the
esteemed
category
of
movie
which
seem
to
have
grow
from
the
union
of
a
drunk
director
,
actor
satisfy
in
the
knowledge
that
this
horrible
flick
will
have
no
lasting
impact
on
they
career
and
a
bunch
of
rip-off
-lrb-
or
homage
as
they
like
to
call
it
-rrb-
from
other
,
better
movie
that
end
up
look
like
a
unflushed
toilet
.
harsh
?
maybe
.
justified
?
hell
yes
!
this
be
a
movie
that
be
not
just
satisfy
in
rip
off
other
movie
but
feel
the
need
to
remind
we
of
that
fact
every
ten
minute
.
for
example
,
a
gunman
burst
into
a
garden
with
the
two
gun
in
he
hand
firing
away
.
this
do
look
moderately
kool
,
but
the
camera
linger
on
the
actor
for
so
long
you
can
almost
hear
the
director
yell
:
''
oooh
,
look
look
!
john
woo
!
two
gun
blaze
!
slooooow
motion
!
''
and
if
that
be
not
enough
,
you
can
also
hear
the
script
grunt
under
the
effort
it
must
take
to
try
and
make
every
single
line
of
dialogue
sound
like
something
deep
and
meaningful
like
in
a
tarantino
movie
.
poor
timothy
hutton
get
to
deliver
most
of
the
corny
line
,
you
have
to
admire
the
effort
he
put
into
it
,
this
guy
deserve
better
.
unlike
most
movie
this
one
do
not
suffer
from
''
stupid
bad
guy
''
syndrome
,
just
to
make
thing
a
little
different
this
time
we
get
stupid
hero
.
example
:
duchovny
manage
to
distract
a
bad
guy
by
make
he
go
into
the
bathroom
to
get
some
bandage
.
now
the
bad
guy
be
,
like
,
stone
,
man
,
so
he
leave
he
shotgun
next
to
we
hero
.
-lrb-
term
use
as
loosely
as
possible
-rrb-
survival
instinct
and
a
good
dose
of
common
sense
seem
to
suggest
grab
the
shotgun
,
which
we
hero
do
,
but
only
after
contemplate
it
for
about
thirty
seconds
.
even
when
he
do
grab
it
he
seem
unsure
how
to
hold
it
,
go
so
far
as
to
actually
wonder
if
he
should
place
a
finger
near
the
trigger
.
mind
you
,
i
have
never
fire
a
shotgun
in
my
life
but
believe
you
I
that
the
bad
guy
would
be
miss
most
of
he
vital
organ
,
be
he
stone
or
not
.
some
will
argue
that
we
hero
do
not
have
a
killer
instinct
,
the
hell
with
that
!
two
fbus
guy
have
just
be
shoot
in
front
I
,
along
with
one
bad
guy
and
the
other
look
like
he
might
go
ballistic
at
any
second
.
solution
?
boom
!
i
'll
take
the
time
to
feel
sorry
about
it
later
thank
you
very
much
.
another
prime
example
of
the
idiot
hero
syndrome
:
we
boy
duchovny
need
to
reach
he
girl
before
something
bad
happen
to
she
.
he
know
the
head
bad
guy
have
she
on
the
tenth
floor
of
a
building
and
that
he
might
be
run
into
a
room
full
of
people
with
itchy
trigger
finger
.
he
still
have
he
shotgun
,
bring
it
along
you
say
?
no
thanks
,
i
'll
just
ditch
it
in
the
back
of
my
car
.
and
the
real
kicker
be
this
:
when
he
reach
the
room
and
people
start
shoot
at
he
he
have
the
nerve
to
look
surprised
!
while
we
be
on
the
subject
of
get
shot
,
why
in
hade
be
those
fbus
guy
sit
with
they
back
to
the
door
?
i
have
get
no
formal
training
but
even
i
know
you
never
sit
with
you
back
to
the
door
.
ask
mr
.
wild
bill
,
the
first
and
only
time
he
do
not
sit
with
he
back
to
a
wall
cost
he
he
life
.
this
be
the
major
problem
with
this
movie
,
any
mook
could
have
think
of
a
hundred
way
to
make
it
better
.
be
it
so
much
to
ask
that
hollywood
actually
put
a
little
common
sense
into
they
character
?
for
instance
:
we
hero
hide
at
duchovny
's
summer
home
,
now
the
bad
guy
could
come
knock
at
any
moment
.
ok
,
this
time
we
hero
do
get
himself
a
gun
and
have
it
at
he
side
most
of
the
time
.
but
see
,
we
hero
be
a
drug
addict
and
guess
what
?
he
choose
now
to
go
clean
and
suffer
through
dt
.
oh
sure
,
he
'll
be
really
impressive
when
the
bad
guy
come
call
.
go
clean
be
really
honorable
of
he
,
but
i
would
have
wait
until
i
do
not
need
to
be
conscious
or
be
able
to
fire
a
gun
.
for
a
enjoyable
performance
by
timothy
hutton
,
plot
hole
the
size
of
godzillum
,
get
we
intelligence
insult
and
several
''
oh
come
on
!
''
moment
.
