take
a
already-thin
concept
and
tediously
stretch
it
far
beyond
the
breaking
point
--
and
that
of

'

level
.
the
first
five
minute
or
so
of
_
roxbury
_
play
very
much
like
one
of
the
original
''
roxbury

''
skit
.
with

''
blare
on
the
soundtrack
,
the
brotherly
duo
of
doug
and
steve
butabus

kattan
and

-rrb-
bob
they
head
,
scope
out
''
hotty
''
at
club
,
and
then
bump
a
select
few
with
violent
pelvic
thrust
.
there
be
one
crucial
difference
,
however
--
these
guy
speak
.
that
little
fact
have
be
use
as
justification
for
the
film
's
existence
,
that
the
butabi
'
newfound
capacity
for
speech
would
open
up
a
whole
new
set
of
door
for
the
character
.
the
door
open
by
director
john
fortenberry
and
screenwriter
steve
koren
,
ferrell
,
and
kattan
be
new
,
that
be
for
sure
,
but
they
all
lead
to
comic
dead
end
.
there
be
no
story
per
se
,
only
a
loosely
structure
and
link
series
of
subplot
.
the
brother
literally
run
into
-lrb-
or
,
rather
,
get
run
into
,
as
in
by
car
-rrb-
richard
grieco
of
_
21_jump_street
_
fame
,
and
through
he
they
gain
entrance
into
the
exclusive
roxbury
club
.
there
,
they
meet
a
hotshot
club
owner
-lrb-
chazz
palminterus
,
conspicuously
uncredited
--
can
you
blame
he
?
-rrb-
,
who
take
a
interest
in
a
idea
of
theirs
.
meanwhile
,
the
bro
'
overbearing
father
-lrb-
dan
hedaya
-rrb-
want
they
to
stop
club
.
when
doug
refuse
and
the
dimwitted
steve
obey
he
father
,
a
rift
be
create
between
the
two
.
the
narrative
messiness
of
_
roxbury
_
would
have
be
forgivable
if
all
that
go
on
be
the
slightest
bit
funny
,
but
virtually
none
of
it
be
.
the
assemble
press
audience
mostly
sit
stonily
silent
throughout
the
entire
film
,
with
the
one
big
exception
be
a
big
laugh
near
the
end
.
alas
,
the
joke
--
a
rather
lazy
takeoff
on
_
jerry_maguire
_
--
will
only
strike
a
chord
with
people
who
have
see
that
film
.
grant
,
a
lot
of
people
_
have
_
see
_
jerry_maguire
_
,
but
the
fact
that
the
film
's
best
joke
be
completely
dependent
on
one
's
familiarity
with
another
film
say
a
lot
about
_
roxbury
_
's
lack
of
inspiration
.
that
lack
of
inspiration
can
be
trace
back
to
the
insipid
character
themselves
.
like
too
many
of
the
skit
on
the
current
incarnation
of
_
saturday_night_live
_
,
''
the
roxbury
guy
''
be
a
one-joke
sketch
that
never
once
suggest
that
the
character
have
enough
comic
life
in
they
to
survive
outside
of
the
sketch
context
.
after
watch
one
of
the
''
roxbury
''
skit
on
snl
,
this
be
what
you
come
away
with
from
the
character
:
they
bob
they
head
to
''
what
be
love
?
''
,
bump
unsuspecting
woman
,
and
...
that
be
all
.
after
watch
_
a_night_at_the_roxbury
_
,
you
'll
be
leave
with
exactly
the
same
.
