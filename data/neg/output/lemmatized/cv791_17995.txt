this
be
the
first
film
in
what
would
become
the
most
successful
series
of
horror
film
of
all
time
.
a
fair
warning
to
those
of
you
who
might
be
incline
to
watch
this
movie
for
the
first
appearance
of
everyone
's
favorite
goalie-mask-wearing
homicidal
maniac
.
jason
,
the
guy
who
single
handedly
control
the
overpopulation
problem
around
the
crystal
lake
area
,
do
not
start
he
quest
to
find
the
most
interesting
household
item
with
which
to
kill
someone
until
the
sequel
.
while
he
do
have
a
small
role
in
this
film
,
we
the
audience
have
to
depend
on
another
blood
thirsty
maniac
to
rack
up
the
body
count
.
the
plot
,
like
every
other
Friday
the
13th
movie
go
something
like
this
--
crazed
killer
murder
as
many
unsuspecting
teenager
as
he\/she\/it
possibly
can
in
the
space
of
a
90
minute
movie
.
the
reason
that
the
afore
mention
unsuspecting
teenager
come
into
contact
with
the
bloodthirsty
killer
be
usually
of
little
importance
to
the
story
.
but
for
those
of
you
out
there
that
might
actually
care
about
such
trivial
matter
in
a
movie
such
as
a
plot
,
here
be
the
basics
.
a
bunch
of
unsuspecting
teens
get
a
summer
job
at
a
long
close
summer
camp
.
they
be
day
away
from
the
arrival
of
the
kid
and
they
be
spend
they
time
fix
the
place
up
and
make
sure
it
be
ready
for
the
kid
.
sadly
,
they
start
be
butcher
one
by
one
by
the
bloodthirsty
killer
.
at
this
point
i
would
usually
say
something
about
the
quality
of
act
,
direct
or
maybe
something
about
the
high
quality
of
the
production
.
since
i
be
not
go
to
do
that
,
feel
free
to
assume
that
if
i
do
,
it
would
not
be
positive
.
i
will
say
that
this
movie
look
as
if
it
be
make
for
about
a
hundred
buck
,
and
that
include
the
actor
'
salary
.
if
you
be
use
to
recent
horror
film
like
scream
,
you
be
in
for
a
bit
of
a
surprise
.
the
only
saving
grace
for
Friday
the
13th
be
that
it
be
really
the
first
of
its
kind
,
with
the
killer
take
real
pride
in
they
work
.
use
as
many
method
of
murder
as
they
could
.
none
of
this
single
murder
weapon
stuff
life
that
unimaginative
leatherface
in
chainsaw
massacre
,
or
the
creatively
stifle
imagination
of
halloween
's
michael
myer
who
just
use
brute
force
or
a
really
big
kitchen
knife
.
nope
,
in
the
Friday
the
13th
movie
,
you
can
always
count
on
the
killer
take
great
pride
in
he
work
.
one
fun
fact
about
this
movie
be
that
the
cast
include
a
very
young
kevin
bacon
,
although
after
this
movie
it
be
a
wonder
he
ever
work
again
.
the
main
reason
to
see
Friday
the
13th
be
if
you
want
to
watch
all
of
the
series
from
the
beginning
.
if
not
,
stick
with
the
later
film
with
jason
,
everyone
's
favorite
hockey
fan
.
Friday
the
13th
be
the
sort
of
movie
that
be
fun
to
sit
down
and
get
a
couple
of
scare
from
,
just
do
not
sit
down
expect
a
whole
lot
.
