lynch
's
film
by
necessity
excise
part
of
the
book
while
retain
the
story
's
two
main
strand
.
one
be
the
long-standing
rivalry
between
two
family
,
house
atreide
and
house
harkonnen
,
and
they
battle
for
lucrative
mining
rights
on
arraki
.
the
second
strand
be
the
emergence
of
young
paul
atreide
as
the
reluctant
messiah
long-awaited
by
the
native
of
arraki
,
the
freman
.
the
deeply
religious
fremen
want
control
over
they
homeworld
,
and
young
paul
may
be
the
fulfilment
of
they
prophecy
that
a
man
would
come
from
the
outer
world
and
lead
they
to
freedom
.
unfortunately
,
this
epic
story
unfold
in
a
confusing
and
haphazard
manner
in
the
theatrical
cut
of
the
film
,
which
run
30
to
60
minute
shorter
than
what
lynch
originally
intend
.
the
thinking
among
universal
's
oh-so-wise
money
man
be
that
film
over
two
hour
in
duration
be
not
popular
with
audience
at
the
time
and
would
not
do
well
at
the
box
office
.
with
lynch
's
initial
cut
run
at
closer
to
three
or
more
hour
,
the
studio
demand
that
further
cut
be
make
.
what
a
great
idea
!
why
not
trim
down
a
already
complex
film
so
as
to
make
it
almost
incomprehensible
?
the
most
glaring
consequence
of
this
one-eyed
stupidity
be
a
hopelessly
jumpy
narrative
,
leave
we
with
badly
underdeveloped
character
.
thus
they
personality
be
vague
,
they
motivation
unclear
and
,
in
the
case
of
paul
's
father
duke
leto
,
they
demise
rather
meaningless
.
the
end
result
be
a
distinct
chill
:
we
can
not
warm
to
most
of
the
cast
and
we
do
not
care
much
for
they
.
and
it
hardly
help
that
the
voice-over
narration
be
sparse
and
that
the
dune-esque
language
and
terminology
sound
like
so
much
gobbledegook
to
those
unfamiliar
with
the
book
.
dune
be
also
a
very
serous
film
.
the
constant
''
self-talk
''
by
various
character
make
it
so
serious
and
self-absorbed
at
time
that
you
may
find
it
hard
not
to
wince
with
embarrassment
.
the
overall
impression
be
a
world
full
of
people
so
intense
that
no
one
be
allow
a
joke
lest
the
universe
come
crash
down
around
they
.
humor
-
or
at
least
a
gentle
kind
of
humor
as
distinct
from
the
harkonnen
's
mad
,
sadistic
kind
-
be
hard
to
find
.
you
may
balk
at
the
comparison
,
but
as
a
writer
lynch
could
well
have
do
with
some
lesson
from
george
lucus
'
star
war
trilogy
.
the
theatrical
version
be
still
some
way
from
be
a
complete
disaster
,
however
.
it
still
possess
enough
of
lynch
's
stylistic
quirk
and
enough
visual
invention
to
sustain
the
interest
of
viewer
with
a
taste
for
imaginative
sci-fus
.
special

whiz
carlo

both

and
the
magnificent
score
by
toto
and
brian
eno
be
one
of
the
most
underrated
soundtrack
of
the
last
twenty
year
.
with
these
element
in
place
and
the
benefit
of
freddie
franci
'
lush
cinematography
,
the
film
be
at
least
a
feast
for
the
sens
.
see
it
in
the
widescreen
format
if
you
can
.
and
despite
all
the

notably

as

the
young
kyle

start
off
somewhat
shakily
,
but
as
he

grow
in
strength
so
do
he
performance
and
he
emerge
as
a
credible
leader
of
the
fremen
crusade
.
the
conclusion
?
any
assessment
of
this
film
must
take
into
account
that
frank
herbert
's
original
novel
be
a
complex
piece
of
work
and
present
a
tough
challenge
for
any
filmmaker
.
david
lynch
take
a
brave
stab
at
it
and
,
partly
due
to
force
beyond
he
control
,
end
up
with
a
officially
release
version
that
fail
in
several
key
respects
.
dune
certainly
confuse
and
frustrate
a
lot
of
people
on
its
release
.
many
choose
to
stay
away
altogether
,
as
the
film
's
disastrous
box
office
show
attest
.
the
extend
version
,
however
,
be
a
rather
different
beast
.
in
1984
lynch
state
he
intention
to
release
he
own
special
edition
''
director
's
cut
''
of
the
film
on
home
video
,
a
clear
indication
of
he
dissatisfaction
with
the
version
that
end
up
in
the
theater
.
but
,
alas
,
he
fail
to
do
so
,
choose
to
move
on
to
other
project
.
in
a
way
,
then
,
it
be
partly
lynch
's
own
fault
that
what
appear
instead
be
a
unauthorised
extend
version
,
put
together
in
1988
by
mca
tv
special
project
for
air
on
cable
network
in
the
usa
.
sting
into
action
,
lynch
successfully
petition
the
director
's
guild
to
take
he
name
off
the
credit
and
replace
it
with
''
allen
smithee
''
,
the
standard
pseudonym
for
director
who
wish
to
disown
they
own
work
.
he
also
have
the
screenwrit
credit
change
to
the
anonymous
''
juda
booth
''
.
certainly
,
look
at
the
result
of
mca
's
handiwork
there
be
at
least
half
a
dozen
instance
that
,
for
sheer
technical
sloppiness
,
be
good
enough
reason
for
the
director
to
object
.
but
these
gripe
must
be
consider
in
light
of
the
improvement
that
the
extended
cut
of
dune
offer
in
several
crucial
area
.
most
of
the
change
involve
the
restoration
or
extension
of
cut
scene
and
the
addition
of
extra
narration
,
both
of
which
fill
many
hole
in
the
original
version
's
storyline
.
paul
's
relationship
with
he
father
and
associate
be
more
intimate
,
with
moment
of
humor
and
warmth
lack
previously
.
the
political
skulduggery
involve
the
emperor
,
the
spacing
guild
,
the
bene
gesserit
and
the
two
war
house
be
far
better
explain
.
paul
's
initiation
into
the
fremen
way
of
life
on
arraki
be
also
flesh
out
considerably
.
and
as
further
background
,
a
new
prologue
have
be
add
feature
narration
and
paint
still
to
give
we
a
brief
history
of
the
dune
universe
.
as
a
piece
of
storytelling
,
then
,
mca
tv
's
version
of
dune
be
clearly
superior
.
as
a
piece
of
editing
,
however
,
it
be
at
time
surprisingly
inept
.
the
use
of
paint
still
in
the
new
prologue
work
well
enough
,
but
they
occasional
appearance
once
the
action
begin
be
inappropriate
.
there
be
some
sloppy
cutting
,
too
,
and
in
a
few
instance
shot
even
appear
out
of
order
.
and
the
use
of
repeat
footage
to
fabricate
certain
scene
-lrb-
eg
.
ship
come
and
go
,
soldier
come
and
go
-rrb-
be
at
time
clearly
out-of-context
.
this
be
the
kind
of
thing
to
which
lynch
object
,
and
rightly
so
.
it
should
also
be
note
that
several
questionable
scene
and
shot
from
the
theatrical
version
be
delete
to
satisfy
the
censorship
demand
of
u
.
s
.
television
.
but
the
most
notable
omission
be
a
gratuitous
piece
of
nonsense
from
lynch
that
be
not
even
in
herbert
's
book
.
the
scene
feature
baron
harkonnen
kill
a
beautiful
young
man
in
front
of
he
slobbering
henchman
by
pull
out
he
''
heart
plug
''
.
its
a
surreal
and
disturbing
episode
that
be
very
lynch-esque
but
add
nothing
to
what
we
already
know
:
the
baron
be
a
nasty
piece
of
work
.
despite
its
own
peculiar
flaw
,
then
,
the
extend
version
of
dune
be
a
generally
superior
film
.
all
up
,
it
contain
35
minute
of
restore
footage
and
approximately
another
15
minute
of
either
alter
,
fabricate
or
newly
create
sequence
.
unless
the
idiosyncratic
lynch
have
a
sudden
change
of
heart
,
the
''
alan
smithee
''
version
remain
the
closest
we
'll
get
to
what
the
movie
should
have
be
.
on
repeat
viewing
,
one
suspect
it
be
closer
than
what
lynch
would
be
prepare
to
admit
.
still
,
as
one
of
this
century
's
great
science-fiction
novel
,
some
fan
and
perhaps
the
late
herbert
himself
would
argue
that
dune
deserve
a
better
fate
in
its
transfer
to
the
screen
.
with
rumor
circulate
of
a
new
six
hour
mini-series
plan
by
production
company
new
amsterdam
entertainment
in
1998
,
it
be
unlikely
that
we
have
hear
the
last
of
the
dune
saga
.
