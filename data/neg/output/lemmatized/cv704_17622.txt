after
1993
's
''
fall
down
,
''
i
hope
that
joel
schumacher
would
mature
into
a
great
director
.
since
then
he
have
offer
we
two
so-so
adaptation
of
john
grisham
novel
-lrb-
''
the
client
''
and
''
a
time
to
kill
''
-rrb-
and
two
batman
movie
that
lower
the
standard
of
that
franchise
.
although
these
disappointment
dampen
my
enthusiasm
for
schumacher
's
potential
,
the
publicity
for
he
latest
release
,
''
8mm
,
''
raise
new
hope
.
it
promise
to
be
something
unusual
.
it
be
not
.
the
plot
go
like
this
:
tom
welle
-lrb-
nicola
cage
-rrb-
be
a
private
eye
who
be
hire
by
a
wealthy
woman
,
allegorically
name
mr
.
christian
-lrb-
myra
carter
-rrb-
,
to
investigate
a
8mm
movie
find
among
she
late
husband
's
belongings
.
the
movie
appear
to
be
a
snuff
film
in
which
a
teenage
girl
be
rape
and
murder
by
a
man
in
a
leather
mask
-lrb-
who
remind
I
of
bane
in
schumacher
's
''
batman
&
robin
''
-rrb-
.
because
murder
can
be
realistically
simulated
in
movie
,
mr
.
christian
want
tom
to
discover
if
the
girl
be
alive
or
dead
.
by
comb
through
miss
person
report
,
tom
find
the
girl
's
name
and
track
she
to
lo
angele
.
with
the
aid
of
max
californium
-lrb-
joaquin
phoenix
-rrb-
,
a
video
store
clerk
-lrb-
and
another
symbolic
name
-rrb-
,
tom
wander
through
the
underworld
of
pornography
in
search
of
snuff
.
the
plot
bear
a
obvious
resemblance
to
paul
schrader
's
''
hardcore
,
''
in
which
a
father
go
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
industry
of
porn
and
sex
to
find
he
miss
daughter
.
both
film
be
model
on
dante
's
''
the
inferno
,
''
of
course
;
''
8mm
''
make
that
connection
overly
obvious
by
cast
max
as
virgil
and
have
he
constantly
tell
tom
that
they
be
head
toward
a
meeting
with
the
devil
.
''
hardcore
''
be
a
much
more
subtle
and
meaningful
film
.
''
8mm
''
have
a
lot
of
promise
.
in
its
better
moment
it
be
a
examination
of
violence
as
entertainment
and
of
the
beast
within
even
a
nice
guy
like
tom
.
one
moment
of
the
first
sort
:
when
we
first
meet
max
he
be
read
truman
capote
's
''
in
cold
blood
''
underneath
the
cover
of
a
porn
novel
.
''
in
cold
blood
''
be
the
father
of
the
true-crime
genre
,
which
be
the
literary
equivalent
of
snuff
film
.
max
promise
that
we
will
see
example
of
the
second
theme
when
he
tell
tom
,
''
dance
with
the
devil
and
the
devil
do
not
change
;
the
devil
change
you
.
''
tom
do
change-i
'll
let
you
discover
the
specifics
for
yourself-but
not
permanently
.
schumacher
and
screenwriter
andrew
kevin
walker
do
not
have
the
gut
to
take
tom
so
far
down
the
dark
tunnel
that
he
could
not
come
back
.
-lrb-
walker
's
''
seven
''
do
a
much
better
job
on
that
theme
by
refuse
to
compromise
-rrb-
.
cage
try
hard
to
pull
it
off
,
but
the
script
do
not
give
he
enough
to
work
with
.
phoenix
walk
away
with
the
movie-he
's
smart
,
charming
,
and
funny
.
other
cast
member
include
''
fargo
''
's
peter
stormare
camp
it
up
as

auteur
dino
velvet
and
''
the
soprano
''
's
jame
gandolfinus
as
a
soulless
porn
merchant
who
push
tom
too
far
.
in
the
last
analysis
,
since
''
8mm
''
fall
short
of
its
pretension
and
its
promise
,
its
just
another
private
eye
story
in
the
raymond
chandler\/ross
macdonald
tradition
of
have
the
detective
uncover
the
depravity
behind
the
glossy
facade
of
wealth
and
privilege
.
however
,
unlike
other
predictable
fare
in
the
genre-last
year
's
''
twilight
,
''
for
example
-
''
8mm
''
be
especially
disappointing
because
it
could
have
be
much
more
than
it
be
.
