the
blob
be
the
remake
of
the
1960
's
classic
-lrb-
a
term
that
i
use
very
loosely
to
define
the
original
-rrb-
about
a
really
mean
glob
of
goop
that
take
out
anything
that
get
in
its
way
.
now
the
original
version
have
the
virtue
of
cheesy
special
effect
which
give
it
a
kind
of
nostalgic
campy
feel
.
the
fact
that
steve
mcqueen
be
the
star
of
the
film
do
not
exactly
hurt
it
either
.
fast
forward
to
the
late
'
80
's
.
steve
mcqueen
be
not
in
the
remake
-lrb-
this
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
have
be
push
up
daisy
for
year
-rrb-
.
nor
be
there
any
hollywood
heavy
hitter
in
the
lead
role
.
that
be
unless
you
count
matt
dillon
's
brother
kevin
as
a
hollywood
heavy
hitter
.
the
other
thing
that
work
against
this
new
blob
be
that
special
effect
technology
have
improve
dramatically
since
the
original
.
the
only
thing
you
need
now
to
have
great
special
effect
in
a
movie
be
deep
pocket
.
it
look
as
if
the
produce
of
the
new
blob
have
a
couple
of
hole
in
they
pocket
.
the
special
effect
in
this
movie
be
cheesy
,
like
the
original
's
.
unlike
the
original
,
they
do
not
look
campy
,
they
just
look
cheap
.
one
bright
spot
in
the
movie
from
a
purely
sexist
point
of
view
be
shawnee
smith
.
she
be
very
attractive
and
can
actually
act
,
which
be
more
than
i
can
say
about
some
of
she
costar
.
in
term
of
plot
,
a
little
ball
of
pink
goop
fall
from
the
sky
.
seem
this
goop
be
a
experiment
that
be
be
house
up
on
a
satellite
.
anyway
,
the
pink
stuff
have
a
taste
for
human
.
the
more
people
it
absorb
,
the
bigger
it
get
.
and
it
be
not
the
friendliest
goop
on
the
block
either
.
anyway
,
it
attack
this
little
town
and
it
be
up
to
the
attractive
local
teenage
population
to
stop
it
.
not
really
,
but
that
be
how
it
seem
.
this
version
attempt
to
recapture
the
camp
of
the
original
.
as
i
have
already
say
,
this
new
version
of
the
blob
come
off
more
as
cheap
,
badly
act
,
and
badly
write
than
campy
.
in
the
year
since
this
film
be
make
none
of
the
cast
have
go
on
to
greatness
.
although
,
star
shawnee
smith
have
a
very
tiny
role
in
armageddon
.
the
reason
that
we
have
never
hear
of
any
of
they
again
be
quite
simple
--
they
all
stink
out
loud
.
although
some
of
the
film
's
smaller
role
be
fill
with
some
actor
that
,
while
not
big
star
,
be
doubtless
people
that
you
will
recognize
from
they
support
role
in
other
movie
and
tv
show
.
it
also
appear
that
the
producer
of
the
blob
try
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
a
special
effect
budget
by
make
the
scene
in
which
the
blob
make
meal
of
the
townsfolk
as
gory
as
possible
.
sadly
,
it
do
not
work
very
well
.
if
you
want
to
see
a
big
ball
of
goop
terrorize
a
town
,
then
i
would
say
that
you
should
skip
the
remake
and
rent
the
original
.
-lrb-
although
that
be
not
so
hot
either
.
-rrb-
this
newest
version
be
seriously
lack
in
any
redeeming
quality
.
