the
best
thing
about
,
''
lake
placid
''
be
that
it
be
only
80
minute
long
and
when
it
be
over
you
be
glad
that
you
do
not
waste
more
than
a
hour
and
a
half
of
you
time
.
it
be
nothing
more
than
a
bad
rip-off
of
,
''
jaw
''
-lrb-
and
i
think
that
be
be
kind
.
-rrb-
it
be
write
by
david
e
.
kelly
-lrb-
''
ally
mcbeal
''
-rrb-
as
a
horror-comedy
but
fail
at
both
,
miserably
.
i
be
never
scare
and
i
think
that
i
only
laugh
once
.
the
crocodile
even
fail
in
comparison
to
the
snake
in
,
''
anaconda
.
''
the
plot
begin
when
a
man
be
eat
in
half
by
the
giant
crocodile
in
black
lake
in
maine
.
that
bring
the
local
sheriff
-lrb-
brendan
gleeson
-rrb-
and
a
fish-and-game
warden
-lrb-
bill
pulman
-rrb-
to
investigate
.
also
,
a
paleontologist
-lrb-
bridget
fonda
-rrb-
from
new
york
be
send
to
look
at
a
tooth
and
a
eccentric
millionaire\/crocodile
lover
-lrb-
oliver
platt
-rrb-
fly
in
because
he
want
to
swim
beside
the
beast
.
soon
there
be
tension
between
everybody
because
half
the
people
want
to
kill
the
croc
and
the
other
half
want
to
save
it
.
there
be
also
a
eccentric
old
lady
-lrb-
betty
white
-rrb-
who
live
by
the
lake
and
have
a
few
secret
.
as
i
mention
before
kelley
and
director
steve
minor
-lrb-
h20
-rrb-
do
not
go
for
a
serious
approach
towards
the
material
but
they
also
do
not
have
anything
sly
or
satirical
or
witty
to
say
either
.
the
betty
white
character
be
completely
unfunny
and
none
of
the
other
character
be
really
that
interesting
,
they
be
all
basically
idiot
.
if
they
have
any
brain
the
croc
would
not
have
be
that
much
of
a
challenge
to
catch
and
they
would
not
have
put
themselves
in
half
of
the
situation
that
they
do
.
but
then
again
,
if
they
be
smart
there
would
not
be
a
movie
.
basically
,
''
lake
placid
''
be
best
undiscovered
.
