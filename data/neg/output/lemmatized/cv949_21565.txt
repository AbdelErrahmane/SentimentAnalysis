`
bat
'
be
a
insulting
slap
across
the
face
for
any
dedicated
horror
movie
fan
.
to
pull
something
like
this
off
,
you
need
to
have
a
sense
of
wit
and
style
,
with
a
heavy
dosage
of
humor
to
back
up
the
process
if
the
fright
factor
ever
decline
.
something
like
the
underground
worm
thriller
`
tremor
'
have
just
the
perfect
mixture
of
these
element
,
and
in
return
,
the
film
be
tremendous
fun
.
with
the
notable
exception
of
a
wisecracking
support
player
,
`
bat
'
mainly
play
it
be
premise
for
straight-arrow
horror
.
judge
by
the
ridiculous
premise
,
this
be
not
exactly
a
wise
move
.
the
movie
attempt
to
capture
the
essence
of
alfred
hitchcock
's
`
the
bird
'
,
but
fail
miserably
.
do
right
,
it
could
have
be
adequately
amusing
halloween
cinema
.
unfortunately
,
`
bat
'
be
a
prime
example
of
a
formulum
movie
do
terribly
,
terribly
wrong
.
the
only
thing
amusing
about
this
festering
pile
of
guano
be
in
how
intelligible
the
filmmaker
anticipate
they
core
audience
to
be
.
i
will
recite
the
follow
paragraph
in
a
manner
that
will
reach
the
audience
of
individual
to
whom
`
bat
'
be
aim
toward
.
those
guy
in
hollywood
have
make
a
movie
about
bat
.
these
bat
be
not
very
nice
,
because
they
eat
a
lot
of
people
.
boy
,
be
these
bat
ugly
.
they
be
infect
with
this
bogus
virus
that
make
they
super-duper
smart
.
they
have
get
big
claw
and
red
eye
and
they
be
not
very
friendly
at
all
.
a
whole
bunch
of
people
in
texa
get
kill
,
so
a
sheriff
guy
and
a
scientist
lady
be
bring
in
to
kill
the
bat
.
they
have
big
gun
and
other
cool
thing
to
fight
they
with
,
but
the
bat
be
pretty
smart
,
so
it
be
sorta
hard
to
do
.
the
bat
swoop
down
and
they
shoot
at
they
to
make
they
go
away
for
good
.
but
no
,
`
bat
'
be
probably
too
violent
for
pre-schooler
.
the
film
,
direct
by
loui
morneau
,
should
have
venture
straight
into
video
store
.
on
the
small
screen
,
perhaps
more
fun
could
have
be
derive
with
lower
expectation
.
but
sit
through
this
crapper
on
the
big
screen
be
almost
awkward
;
although
at
a
few
moment
it
become
a
guilty
pleasure
,
the
film
be
poorly
write
,
poorly
act
and
execute
with
glaring
ineptitude
.
even
the
bat
themselves
be
cheesy
,
and
the
attack
sequence
too
rush
and
jittery
to
be
properly
enjoy
.
the
sheriff
in
the
story
be
emmett
kimsey
-lrb-
lou
diamond
phillip
-rrb-
,
who
embody
every
pathetic
stereotype
a
small-town
authority
figure
usually
portray
-lrb-
he
chomp
on
a
cigar
,
strut
contentedly
in
he
boot
,
etc
...
-rrb-
.
the
scientist
be
dr
.
sheila
casper
-lrb-
dina
meyer
-rrb-
,
who
specialize
in
fly
mammal
and
be
classify
as
`
the
best
in
she
field
'
.
meyer
use
a
lot
of
technical
term
design
to
make
the
movie
seem
more
intellectually
capable
,
but
everything
about
dr
.
casper
be
recycle
beyond
recognition
.
she
memory
of
how
she
become
hooked
on
the
topic
of
bat
sound
suspiciously
like
oceanographic
student
matt
hooper
's
tale
of
how
he
become
infatuate
with
shark
in
`
jaw
'
.
everything
revolve
around
`
bat
'
be
tired
drivel
,
which
desperately
require
some
directorial
style
or
act
capability
to
spruce
it
up
.
the
support
cast
could
have
be
construct
out
of
straw
,
with
voice
dub
in
later
.
in
fact
,
that
may
have
work
out
better
in
the
end
.
take
one
glance
at
casper
's
bat-loathing
sidekick
jimmy
-lrb-
leon
-rrb-
,
and
you
'll
have
immediate
deja
vu
-
he
be
the
exact
same
humorous
buddy
caricature
from
every
other
movie
,
construct
specifically
for
time
comic
relief
.
unfortunately
,
none
of
he
comic
interlude
be
funny
.
in
the
role
of
deranged
mad
scientist
dr
.
mccabe
,
the
reliable
bob
gunton
get
corner
with
the
most
hideously
idiotic
character
in
the
bunch
.
mccabe
`
accidentally
'
release
two
experimental
test
subject
,
and
the
virus
spread
to
other
bat
.
the
entire
town
of
gallup
,
texa
be
under
attack
from
a
enormous
swarm
of
the
creature
,
but
gunton
appear
to
be
inconspicuously
contemplate
something
else
.
something
like
:
`
when
be
the
damn
movie
go
to
be
over
?
?
i
just
want
my
money
.
'
the
bat
be
ugly
,
i
must
say
.
there
be
the
occasional
moment
where
they
look
moderately
convincing
,
but
mainly
,
the
swarm
be
represent
in
cheesy
digital
imagery
.
only
bit
of
the
bloody
action
even
hint
at
the
campy
fun
the
film
could
have
be
,
but
by
the
absurdly
stupid
climax
,
it
be
way
too
late
in
the
game
for
a
decent
recovery
.
character
experiment
in
slaughter
the
bat
with
gunfire
.
let
's
explore
the
logic
there
:
be
this
really
a
very
efficient
way
to
decrease
the
bat
population
?
?
you
could
empty
a
entire
clip
at
the
fly
winged
serpent
and
not
even
wind
one
,
and
after
that
there
be
only
18
,
000
more
of
they
.
this
kind
of
behavior
represent
the
regular
level
of
intelligence
behind
`
bat
'
.
