well
if
you
be
up
for
stellar
effect
then
this
be
the
movie
for
you
.
because
that
all
that
there
really
be
...
i
find
that
after
watch
this
movie
it
have
many
many
gap
and
flaw
in
simple
logic
in
the
plot
.
for
one
thing
,
a
white
lead
actor
who
have
a
black
daughter
do
leave
some
curiosity
...
i
be
not
say
that
this
be
not
possible
.
.
but
it
do
leave
one
to
wonder
...
i
know
i
do
.
another
thing
be
that
this
movie
have
section
which
be
painfully
stretch
out
...
and
certain
scene
be
repeat
essentially
but
with
slight
variation
.
there
be
one
scene
that
should
have
be
short
...
but
it
be
horribly
stretch
and
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
it
i
find
myself
think
.
.
ok
enough
already
get
on
with
it
.
there
be
also
time
where
you
have
to
wonder
why
thing
happen
the
way
they
do
...
thing
just
magically
happen
and
there
be
no
prelude
or
anything
of
the
sort
...
another
thing
that
i
notice
towards
the
end
be
that
some
character
just
vanish
without
a
trace
but
they
be
fairly
major
through
most
of
the
beginning
.
this
movie
be
also
very
predictable
...
you
can
almost
tell
the
final
story
somewhere
in
the
middle
and
you
definitely
know
what
will
happen
at
a
give
moment
.
.
grant
this
be
hard
to
omit
but
here
its
just
blatant
it
sit
there
and
stare
at
you
.
also
some
of
the
thing
that
happen
be
a
little
too
predictable
and
several
clique
be
repeat
...
it
get
bore
at
time
to
tell
you
the
truth
...
even
though
there
be
still
action
go
on
.
another
little
point
i
might
add
be
that
the
main
character
be
suppose
to
be
a
quiet
chaos
mathematician
not
some
shoot
they
up
type
of
hero
.
some
of
the
character
be
not
proper
for
they
role
.
the
acting
be
fine
but
the
character
just
do
not
seem
to
add
up
.
if
i
be
to
base
my
review
totally
on
the
plot
then
i
would
not
rate
this
movie
too
highly
but
that
be
just
the
thing
this
movie
be
not
just
the
plot
,
its
the
whole
package
and
this
package
be
really
well
do
.
the
whole
movie
be
really
well
do
and
look
really
good
and
if
one
be
to
overlook
the
flaw
in
the
plot
and
character
then
this
be
really
a
movie
.
the
special
effect
be
just
amazing
,
you
can
not
tell
that
the
dinosaur
be
create
it
look
like
they
be
there
live
,
in
a
few
instance
of
course
you
know
its
fake
but
there
be
other
time
that
you
just
would
not
be
able
to
say
that
the
creature
be
not
there
during
film
,
extinct
or
not
.
another
thing
be
the
destruction
scene
...
wow
,
those
be
masterpiece
.
.
well
some
of
they
be
they
be
well
choreographed
and
along
with
the
dino
's
make
this
one
of
the
reason
to
see
this
movie
.
this
movie
be
fairly
long
but
it
be
action
pack
so
it
should
do
well
in
the
box
office
.
.
unfortunately
it
will
take
away
from
fifth
element
but
alas
what
can
we
do
.
.
i
may
be
too
cynical
for
my
age
but
this
movie
be
only
worth
see
for
the
effect
and
for
it
few
funny
moment
.
.
go
see
it
in
a
matinee
if
you
really
must
see
it
its
not
worth
full
price
if
you
ask
I
.
one
little
side
note
,
although
my
opinion
of
this
movie
may
not
have
be
the
best
the
way
that
this
movie
be
market
and
how
many
theater
it
be
show
in
toronto
this
opening
weekend
be
nothing
short
of
stupid
,
there
be
10
theater
movie
theater
that
be
play
this
movie
around
the
clock
i
think
that
some
people
really
want
money
badly
...
and
i
think
that
this
type
of
activity
hurt
the
movie
industry
let
the
other
movie
also
have
a
chance
...
you
know
any
movie
with
that
much
play
would
succeed
even
if
it
be
the
worst
movie
ever
make
...
i
think
i
would
put
this
here
to
deflate
the
movie
hype
about
this
flick
...
its
not
that
bad
a
movie
but
its
not
that
great
either
hope
you
people
realize
this
.
