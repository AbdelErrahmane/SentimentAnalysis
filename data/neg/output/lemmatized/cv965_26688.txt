certain
thing
in
we
life
be
inevitable
.
death
,
sorrow
,
love
,
heartbreak
,
pain
,
joy
.
we
expect
these
event
.
we
know
they
be
go
to
happen
and
some
,
we
even
look
forward
to
.
it
be
part
of
the
human
condition
.
we
have
also
become
accustomed
to
inevitable
occurrence
in
we
society
.
as
we
near
the
fall
election
,
several
of
they
be
hit
we
in
the
face
.
politician
exaggerate
they
own
importance
.
we
side
be
always
right
;
theirs
be
always
wrong
.
in
the
end
,
voter
be
usually
force
to
choose
the
lesser
of
two
whocare
.
in
hollywood
the
one
indisputable
inevitable
be
that
if
a
film
make
big
money
,
there
will
be
a
sequel
.
even
if
the
original
story
do
not
merit
one
.
even
if
the
first
film
be
complete
in
itself
.
even
if
success
be
a
fluke
.
''
the
blair
witch
project
''
be
make
with
a
budget
of
$
1
.
75
and
explode
on
the
screen
,
rake
in
huge
profit
.
the
concept
be
brilliant
.
the
filmmaker
create
a
remarkable
buzz
that
the
story
might
be
real
.
the
film
itself
be
even
more
convincing
.
the
movie
_
must
_
be
authentic
.
why
else
would
such
amateurish
footage
be
on
the
big
screen
?
the
first
film
catch
lightning
in
a
bottle
.
the
sequel
prove
you
can
not
pour
that
old
lightning
into
a
new
bottle
.
you
have
to
give
this
effort
some
credit
.
it
would
have
be
easy
to
have
make
the
same
movie
again
with
a
new
group
of
kid
.
it
would
have
be
easy
,
but
of
course
,
it
would
not
have
work
.
instead
''
book
of
shadow
''
acknowledge
the
first
film
as
a
movie
and
concentrate
on
the
hysteria
follow
its
release
.
it
be
a
great
scheme
and
possibly
the
only
entertaining
way
to
do
a
sequel
.
unfortunately
it
do
not
work
either
.
five
kid
spend
the
night
in
the
wood
at
the
scene
of
the
first
film
.
weird
stuff
happen
and
they
retreat
to
a
old
factory
where
one
of
they
live
.
even
weirder
stuff
happen
.
some
people
die
,
there
be
blood
and
knife
and
none
of
the
character
have
a
lick
of
common
sense
.
while
supposedly
do
serious
research
,
the
group
set
up
a
circle
of
surveillance
camera
in
the
ruin
of
the
old
house
in
the
wood
and
vow
to
stay
alert
all
night
await
a
visitation
.
then
they
proceed
to
get
totally
trash
on
drug
and
alcohol
and
party
down
with
very
loud
,
very
obnoxious
heavy
metal
music
.
it
be
a
bad
plan
.
the
cast
show
some
early
promise
.
a
couple
be
do
research
on
a
''
blair
witch
''
book
.
the
tour
guide
be
a
former
mental
patient
turn
ebay
aficionado
.
a
goth
amazon
princess
add
a
bit
of
comedic
relief
.
the
obligatory
hot
babe
be
the
2000
spiritual
cinematic
descendent
of
the
cute
hippie
chick
,
the
cute
rock
and
roll
chick
and
the
cute
disco
chick
:
the
cute
wiccan
chick
.
the
first
film
's
unaccomplished
actor
come
across
as
real
people
in
a
real
situation
because
hour
and
hour
of
video
be
shoot
during
day
in
the
wood
.
this
time
,
these
unaccomplished
actor
just
come
across
as
unaccomplished
actor
.
there
be
not
one
character
you
care
about
when
they
start
shout
for
no
reason
.
although
what
pass
for
a
plot
start
out
with
a
solid
idea
,
it
be
ruin
by
poor
execution
.
the
follow-up
to
one
of
the
most
successful
horror
film
ever
be
nothing
more
than
a
bad
slasher
movie
.
they
be
trap
in
a
old
big
weird
house
.
they
stupidly
separate
into
various
room
.
there
be
strange
noise
,
they
see
scary
apparition
and
people
disappear
.
ever
see
this
movie
?
seasoned
documentary
director
joe
berlinger
should
know
better
.
the
film
feature
mostly
cheap
trick
and
unnecessary
gore
.
for
a
storyline
fill
with
surprise
,
it
be
oddly
predicable
.
''
the
blair
witch
project
''
be
a
rare
triumph
of
style
over
substance
.
''
the
book
of
shadow
''
be
a
triumph
of
tedium
over
promise
.
