well
there
go
another
one
.
sadly
this
like
other
movie
this
year
be
not
good
.
this
one
be
almost
as
bad
as
`
the
omega
code
'
but
not
quite
.
from
the
opening
credit
i
have
a
good
feeling
this
would
be
bad
,
and
well
i
guess
i
be
right
.
with
bad
excuse
for
act
,
a
horrible
screenplay
and
straight-out
bad
direction
`
the
bachelor
'
be
a
terribly
unfunny
movie
that
do
not
work
on
any
level
accept
that
fact
that
rene
zellwegar
who
do
give
a
good
performance
.
the
two
cameo
by
brooke
shield
and
mariah
carey
be
also
good
with
brooke
be
the
best
.
the
movie
be
trouble
from
the
start
because
chris
o'donnell
be
hugely
miscast
and
give
one
of
the
worst
performance
to
date
.
here
be
the
stupid
plot
:
chris
o'donnell
play
jimmie
shelton
a
man
who
have
just
break
up
with
he
girlfriend
,
he
meet
anne
-lrb-
rene
zellwegar
-rrb-
they
instantly
hit
it
off
and
be
together
for
three
year
.
jimmie
decide
that
he
want
to
bring
they
relationship
a
little
bit
up
.
he
really
do
not
realize
that
anne
think
he
want
to
marry
she
-lrb-
what
he
want
i
never
do
catch
-rrb-
.
so
he
propose
in
a
really
bad
way
,
and
she
shoot
he
down
and
be
very
mad
.
he
of
course
try
to
apologize
but
nothing
seem
to
help
any
.
then
he
grandfather
die
and
he
learn
that
he
have
leave
jimmie
100
million
dollar
...
as
long
as
he
marry
before
the
next
day
at
6
:
05
pm
.
now
jimmie
must
find
anne
and
try
to
marry
she
to
get
the
money
and
because
he
love
she
,
or
get
marry
to
someone
else
to
get
the
money
itself
,
lead
to
a
un-funny
and
predictable
end
that
leave
a
bad
taste
in
we
mouth
.
ok
so
maybe
this
could
be
one
of
the
dumbest
,
cliched
,
silliest
romantic
comedy
to
date
that
have
no
real
big
laugh
.
even
the
support
role
of
artie
lange
,
hal
holbrook
and
ed
anser
be
not
even
good
.
the
plot
be
a
good
idea
,
but
the
script
would
have
to
have
be
write
in
less
than
five
minute
and
by
a
five
year
old
.
the
choppy
dialogue
and
bad
directing
do
not
help
thing
any
.
even
though
chris
o'donnell
give
a
ok
performance
in
the
two
batman
movie
,
he
do
not
give
even
a
remotely
good
or
funny
performance
here
and
i
want
to
boo
and
throw
my
pop
at
the
screen
to
get
rid
of
he
.
rene
zelweggar
be
a
different
story
and
give
a
charming
,
sweet
and
likable
performance
-lrb-
as
usual
-rrb-
and
really
be
the
only
thing
that
save
this
confused
movie
from
be
a
total
huge
washout
.
she
sister
play
by
marley
shelton
be
also
good
and
the
two
have
good
chemistry
onscreen
.
brooke
shield
show
up
in
a
funny
little
performance
as
a
big-headed
mogul
who
after
a
while
become
routine
and
old
.
one
really
can
not
help
but
think
that
we
have
see
this
stuff
before
.
it
be
not
like
this
be
a
original
idea
and
in
the
end
,
everyone
know
what
be
go
to
happen
due
do
its
cliche
and
typicalness
.
`
the
bachelor
'
work
on
no
good
level
and
in
fact
do
not
work
at
all
.
ed
anser
and
hal
holbrook
be
waste
in
terrible
role
and
mariah
carey
can
not
act
to
save
she
soul
,
and
this
could
be
the
only
film
of
she
movie
career
dispite
she
terrific
music
career
.
chris
o'donnell
be
not
as
bad
a
actor
as
casper
van
dien
but
that
be
not
say
a
great
deal
.
he
seem
hold
back
and
really
do
not
get
into
he
character
much
and
after
even
the
first
30
minute
get
annoying
and
old
.
artie
lange
just
to
I
seem
like
he
be
try
to
another
chri
farley
and
be
completely
unfunny
and
un-nerving
.
why
the
filmmaker
would
want
to
waste
such
a
cast
in
such
a
bad
movie
,
with
such
bad
acting
and
dialogue
be
a
question
only
they
will
know
.
maybe
they
think
it
would
become
a
hit
or
a
critical
success
,
and
sometimes
i
do
not
agree
with
other
critic
on
movie
,
even
from
the
trailer
for
this
film
they
make
it
look
bad
and
show
all
the
mildly
funny
part
.
its
base
on
the
1925
silent
film
`
seven
chance
'
which
i
be
sure
be
very
better
than
this
mess
.
even
though
some
may
think
of
this
as
a
good
date
movie
,
most
who
see
this
will
want
to
pull
out
thier
hair
and
scream
for
thier
money
back
.
besides
be
a
terrible
movie
,
`
the
bachelor
'
be
well
a
terrible
movie
.
it
have
nothing
worth
recommend
therefore
i
really
can
not
recommend
this
movie
.
i
do
not
have
a
good
time
and
i
laugh
only
three
time
.
the
run
time
of
the
movie
be
106
minute
which
be
wayyyy
over
time
and
need
to
be
shorten
at
least
thirty
minute
.
part
of
it
seem
to
go
on
forever
and
part
of
seem
to
not
last
enough
time
.
be
one
of
the
worst
movie
of
the
year
,
we
can
be
sure
that
i
hope
they
will
not
make
anymore
stupid
unfunny
romantic
comedy
,
and
if
they
do
they
i
give
up
on
filmmaker
.
