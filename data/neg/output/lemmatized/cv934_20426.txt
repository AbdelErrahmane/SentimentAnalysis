the
review
jean-claude
van
damme
have
a
one-liner
early
on
in
universal
soldier
:
the
return
,
he
latest
attempt
to
remain
relevant
,
that
sum
up
this
entire
movie
;
he
say
''
be
there
,
do
that
.
''
no
film
critic
could
possibly
sum
up
van
damme
's
recent
film
choice
any
better
.
while
other
ageing
action
star
have
wisely
move
into
other
film
genre
-lrb-
schwarzenegger
make
as
many
family
comedy
as
he
do
action

-rrb-
,
van
damme
stubbornly
persist
in
stick
with
what
use
to
work
for
he
:
martial
art
and
gun
.
this
unwillingness
or
perhaps
inability
to
move
into
new
genre
have
cause
van
damme
to
enter
the
straight
to
video
world
,
with
legionnaire
never
see
the
inside
of
a
multiplex
.
he
join
fellow
martial
artist\/action
star
steven
seagal
as
they
watch
they
film
career
rapidly
fizzle
away
.
universal
soldier
:
the
return
be
truly
poor
.
the
plot
be
a
complete
copy
of
several
action
film
from
this
decade
,
specifically
terminator
2
:
judgement
day
and
the
similarly
name
soldier
.

super-soldier

off
to
retirement
when
circumstance
force
he
to
battle

successor

for
the
good
of
a

try
to
save
john

and
jean-claude
,
a
former
universal

,
have
to
save
the
planet
from
the
rampage
of
a
group
of
,
you
guess
it
,
newer
model
soldier
.
consider
the
poor
box
office
performance
of
soldier
,
it
be
amazing
that
this
project
be
ever
give
the
go-ahead
.
luc

in
this
sequel
-lrb-
technically
the
fourth
film
in
the
series
,
follow
two
straight-to-video

that
be

who
interestingly
also
appear
in

-rrb-
,
the
unisol
program
have
engineer
a
tougher
,
fiercer
fight
force
with
the
help
of

unfortunately
,
upon
hearing
that
the

he
daughter

the
rest
of
the
film
involve
luc
try
to
keep
they
all
alive
,
while
beat
up
a
group
of
near-indestructible
soldier
,
most
notably
romeo
-lrb-
popular
wrestler
goldberg
-rrb-
.
there
be
lot
of
fight
,
gun
battle
,
lame
plot
development
and
a
noticeable
lack
of
plausibility
.
there
be
so
many
clich
?
s
in
this
film
that
it
be
almost
painful
to
watch
.
luc
get
saddle
with
the
task
of
save
erin
the
reporter
early
on
,
and
in
the
course
of
a
single
night
,
they
go
from
bicker
to
fall
for
each
other
,
to
kiss
.
erin
be
a
pathetically-written
character
;
people
be
get
brutally
gun
down
all
around
she
,
and
yet
,
not
only
do
this
not
seem
to
frighten
she
,
but
she
find
time
to
remind
luc
that
she
''
be
not
leave
without
she
story
''
.
whatever
.
other
laughable
moment
include
a
-rrb-
luc
go
to
a
strip
club
to
get
internet
access
-lrb-
what
?
-rrb-
and
b
-rrb-
a
group
of
ranger
,
who
after
have
be
give
good
advice
-lrb-
luc
tell
they
that
they
weapon
be
useless
,
and
show
they
a
specific
gun
which
should
work
better
-rrb-
,
choose
to
go
into
battle
with
they
useless
weapon
anyway
-lrb-
guess
who
win
the
battle
?
-rrb-
.
not
one
single
scene
in
universal
soldier
:
the
return
have
any
originality
to
it
.
when
fuel
by
don
davi
'
loud
,
drive
music
score
,
the
film
's
many
fight
become
almost
passable
,
but
mostly
be
full
of
the
same
ol'
jean-claude
move
.
director
mic
rodger
-lrb-
a
former
stunt
co-ordinator
-rrb-
keep
the
action
come
at
a
rapid
pace
,
with
only
a
few
token
serious
moment
to
be
find
.
he
past
work
be
evident
in
the
many
moment
when
character
be
throw
through
window
,
toss
off
of
building
or
send
fly
through
the
air
thanks
to
a
explosion
.
if
only
jean-claude
be
not
get
so
old
and
slow
compare
to
younger
martial
art
film
actor
like
jet
li
,
rodger
could
probably
have
make
a
decent
action
film
.
to
place
the
blame
squarely
at
van
damme
's
foot
,
however
,
be
a
injustice
.
i
be
not
sure
that
anyone
,
not
even
robert
deniro
or
edward
norton
,
could
make
writer
william
malone
and
john
fasano
's
script
sound
good
.
one
particularly
painful
scene
be
when
erin
ask
luc
how
he
be
so
sure
that
the
aforementioned
strip
club
will
have
internet
access
.
he
cringe
,
look
down
and
mutter
''
uh
...
uhm
...
they
all
do
,
i
see
it
on
60
minute
.
eh
he
he
he
''
the
script
's
and
indeed
the
entire
film
's
only
saving
grace
be
goldberg
.
he
chew
up
every
scene
he
be
in
,
obviously
enjoy
he
role
immensely
.
he
even
give
the
film
a
few
laugh
,
as
he
mutter
thing
like
''
i
really
do
not
like
that
guy
''
every
time
he
fail
to
kill
luc
.
sadly
,
he
presence
be
not
enough
to
turn
universal
soldier
:
the
return
into
anything
better
than
a
below-average
action
film
that
truly
deserve
to
have
join
its
fellow
sequel
by
go
straight-to-video
.
