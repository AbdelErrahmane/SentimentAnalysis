everything
in
the
phantom
you
have
see
many
time
before
and
there
be
nothing
new
present
here
.
wincer
display
absolutely
no
skill
in
set
up
a
exciting
action
sequence
.
billy
zane
be
wooden
as
the
hero
.
kristy
swanson
be
give
very
little
to
do
,
and
do
very
little
with
it
.
treat
william
,
look
like
rhett
butler
but
sound
like
mickey
mouse
,
be
one
of
the
worst
villain
i
have
ever
see
in
a
movie
.
only
catherine
zeta
jone
,
as
one
of
william
cohort
turn
in
a
good
performance
.
she
have
energy
and
spunk
,
which
the
movie
need
much
more
of
.
oh
yeah
,
the
phantom
also
have
a
secret
identity
but
this
be
so
poorly
play
out
you
will
not
even
care
.
about
the
only
thing
i
can
recommend
be
a
good
performance
by
jone
,
and
some
colorful
scenery
.
however
,
if
youre
look
for
a
fun
family
movie
,
go
watch
the
underrated
flipper
.
this
be
not
a
good
movie
.
