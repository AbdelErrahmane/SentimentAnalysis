the
rapid-fire
formulum
that
work
so
well
in
airplane
!
,
the
''
police
squad
!
''
television
series
,
top
secret
!
,
three
naked
gun
film
,
and
two
hot
shot
!
movie
have
finally
reach
a
desperate
dead-end
with
spy
hard
.
even
ezio
gregio
's
the
silence
of
the
ham
be
arguably
funnier
than
this
over-extended
spy
-
and
action-movie
spoof
.
leslie
nielsen
star
as
secret
agent
wd-40
,
who
return
from
retirement
to
battle
he
old
nemesis
,
general
rancor
-lrb-
a
cackle
andy
griffith
-rrb-
.
the
joke
fly
in
every
direction
and
with
hardly
a
hint
of
restraint
,
timing
,
or
tact
.
most
the
movie
be
comprise
of
recycled
airplane
and
naked
gun
gag
,
recreate
movie
sequence
,
and
soggy
star
cameo
.
yeah
,
maybe
we
\*
do
\*
need
ray
charle
drive
a
l
.
a
.
bus
bind
for
a
speed
bump
,
but
do
mr
.
t
,
hulk
hogan
,
and
dr
.
joyce
brother
also
have
to
appear
in
the
same
movie
?
leslie
nielsen
play
it
straight
with
he
usual
dopey
flair
.
there
be
something
oddly
inspiring
about
the
sight
of
nielsen
wear
a
nun
's
habit
,
even
the
result
sister
act
spoof
be
silly
.
as
be
the
bit
directly
lift
from
home
alone
,
pulp
fiction
,
true
lie
,
etc
.
etc
.
-lrb-
adolescent
male
might
enjoy
this
mess
,
tho
.
the
butt
shot
,
breast
peek
,
penis
poke
,
flatulence
gag
,
and
related
innuendo
be
right
up
beavi
and
butthead
's
alley
.
-rrb-
beyond
the
hilarious
title
sequence
with
''
weird
''
al
yankovich
perform
the
theme
song
,
spy
hard
be
barely
the
stock
that
it
be
print
on
.
my
recommendation
:
duck
in
while
you
be
wait
for
another
movie
to
start
.
stay
long
enough
to
see
the
camera
dart
inside
of
weird
al
's
nostril
and
then
leave
.
you
will
not
miss
a
thing
.
