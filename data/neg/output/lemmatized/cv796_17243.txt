wonderland
be
a
rather
sugary
romance
film
that
be
as
subtle
as
a
ton
of
brick
fall
on
you
.
you
can
see
its
plot
develop
from
a
mile
away
.
you
be
lure
into
its
benign
story
of
a
single
29-year-old
girl
look
for
a
soul
mate
in
boston
,
as
that
city
be
depict
as
a
mini-wonderland
for
singles
.
this
be
a
star
orient
film
,
and
the
star
who
carry
the
film
be
erin
-lrb-
hope
davi
-rrb-
.
that
this
be
a
date
film
,
about
singles
who
for
reason
of
fate
or
luck
,
or
whatnot
,
have
not
have
a
successful
match
and
be
now
put
most
of
they
energy
into
fulfil
they
career
,
be
nothing
new
,
this
type
of
film
have
be
do
often
and
better
many
time
in
contemporary
film
.
the
fictionalized
documentary
unmade
bed
do
it
more
provocatively
and
with
more
of
a
sense
of
urgency
than
this
film
.
the
main
quirk
in
the
plot
here
,
be
that
hope
's
pushy
mother
-lrb-
hollan
-rrb-
visit
she
in
boston
,
see
she
daughter
's
live-in
relationship
with
a
radical
protester
-lrb-
hoffman
-rrb-
breakup
and
decide
to
put
a
personal
ad
in
the
newspaper
for
she
harvard
medical
school
drop-out
daughter
,
who
work
as
a
nurse
.
this
be
do
without
she
knowledge
.
it
be
cornball
sitcom
stuff
,
but
,
at
least
,
it
be
handle
as
best
it
could
be
by
the
actor
and
director
.
it
be
easy
to
like
erin
,
she
be
bright
,
caring
,
and
attractively
blonde
.
it
be
equally
easy
to
care
for
the
soul
mate
she
keep
miss
contact
with
,
the
financially
strap
,
ruggedly
handsome
,
intelligent
35-year-old
alan
-lrb-
alan
-rrb-
,
who
no
longer
want
to
work
with
he
father
as
a
plumber
but
be
do
volunteer
work
at
the
aquarium
and
attend
college
to
be
a
marine
biologist
.
of
course
,
he
come
across
as
be
so
good
-lrb-
though
,
he
do
kill
some
fish
in
the
aquarium
-rrb-
,
that
it
be
hard
to
believe
he
be
for
real
,
or
just
some
cardboard
shine
knight
put
into
the
story
to
give
it
a
ideal
to
shoot
for
.
the
contrived
story
revolve
around
they
near
miss
in
meeting
each
other
in
such
spot
as
,
the
subway
,
at
a
restaurant
,
or
on
the
phone
.
alan
's
brother
answer
erin
's
ad
with
a
few
of
he
pal
,
as
they
each
try
to
respond
to
she
ad
in
a
phony
way
,
make
a
bet
that
the
first
who
get
to
tongue
kiss
she
,
that
the
other
witness
,
will
win
the
bet
.
this
sub-plot
be
as
obnoxious
to
see
take
place
as
it
be
to
hear
tell
.
that
we
have
to
see
erin
go
through
several
date
to
prove
the
point
how
ego
sick
these
guy
be
,
each
one
more
annoying
than
the
other
,
culminate
in
the
most
obnoxious
one
of
all
,
that
brazilian
lover
-lrb-
jose
-rrb-
,
who
be
about
as
charming
as
a
snake-oil
salesman
,
who
be
actually
the
one
she
nearly
fly
away
with
for
a
holiday
in
brazil
,
be
not
only
incredulous
but
downright
contrary
to
the
rich
presentation
of
she
character
that
be
the
heart
of
the
story
.
anyway
,
as
expect
,
all
's
well
that
end
well
,
for
this
watchable
piece
of
fluff
,
that
come
over
on
screen
better
than
it
do
when
relate
its
story-line
.
the
dialogue
be
actually
not
bad
,
those
date
erin
or
try
to
flirt
with
she
seem
to
be
utter
authentic
thing
they
would
actually
say
in
they
situation
.
and
,
oh
,
by
the
way
,
wonderland
refer
to
the
stop
on
the
boston
metro
,
it
be
where
greyhound
racing
take
place
.
