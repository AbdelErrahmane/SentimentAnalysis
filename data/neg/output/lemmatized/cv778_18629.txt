david
spade
have
a
snide
,
sarcastic
sense
of
humor
that
work
perfectly
on
the
tv
sitcom
just
shoot
I
.
it
also
serve
as
a
good
showcase
for
he
when
he
co-star
,
opposite
the
late
chri
farley
,
in
tommy
boy
and
black
sheep
.
lose
and
find
mark
the
comedian
's
first
attempt
at
go
solo
in
a
movie
,
and
it
also
reveal
that
when
spade
do
not
have
a
reliable
back-up
system
,
he
brand
of
humor
seem
more
desperate
than
one
may
expect
.
david
spade
be
not
the
problem
with
lose
and
find
.
he
play
dylan
ramsey
,
the
sweet
main
character
,
to
the
best
of
he
ability
.
the
story
revolve
around
dylan
's
obsession
with
he
beautiful
new
neighbor
,
lilum
duboi
-lrb-
sophie
marceau
,
from
braveheart
-rrb-
,
and
she
terrier
name
jack
.
dylan
believe
that
the
best
way
to
a
woman
's
heart
be
through
she
dog
.
and
so
he
kidnap
jack
,
plan
to
stage
a
fake
rescue
,
in
hope
to
win
lilum
over
.
there
be
three
good
thing
about
lose
and
find
.
the
first
be
spade
.
the
second
be
sophie
marceau
,
a
lovely
actress
who
be
be
plant
into
the
wrong
movie
.
lastly
,
there
be
the
dog
,
who
be
use
here
in
a
similar
context
to
puffy
from
there
be
something
about
mary
.
unfortunately
,
director
jeff
pollack
find
more
humor
in
put
jack
through
a
cycle
in
the
drier
than
he
do
with
simply
make
he
look
cute
.
this
kind
of
physical
humor
be
dead
.
pollack
do
everything
but
beat
the
poor
pooch
with
a
baseball
bat
to
get
laugh
,
and
this
procedure
be
cheap
,
unfunny
and
resoundingly
cruel
.
this
be
where
i
start
to
get
fuzzy
.
also
in
this
unusual
blend
be
-lrb-
apparently
-rrb-
a
sweet-natured
love
story
between
dylan
and
lilum
.
give
the
mean-spirited
comedy
that
the
movie
be
obviously
strive
for
,
i
find
this
hard
to
swallow
.
and
,
why
do
dylan
even
deserve
someone
like
lilum
,
after
kidnapping
she
precious
dog
and
put
it
through
such
pain
?
predictably
,
lose
and
find
opt
for
a
happy
ending
,
one
that
feel
so
sentimental
,
gooey
,
and
ring
so
false
that
it
set
off
a
siren
in
you
head
that
make
you
feel
a
bit
cheated
.
david
spade
-lrb-
who
also
co-write
the
movie
-rrb-
try
hard
,
so
very
hard
,
to
make
this
project
amusing
.
there
be
some
choice
scene
that
be
quite
funny
,
but
the
movie
be
only
sporadically
funny
.
patrick
bruel
play
the
stock
character
of
rene
,
the
pompous
jerk
who
also
want
to
win
lilum
over
,
with
he
good
look
and
money
.
jon
lovitz
and
martin
sheen
be
welcome
addition
in
two
tiny
support
role
.
despite
a
few
positive
attribute
,
lose
and
find
just
do
not
work
.
if
you
be
search
for
a
enjoyable
romantic-comedy
,
you
could
do
far
better
than
this
obvious
,
misguided
failure
that
show
a
blatant
disregard
for
what
it
be
try
to
present
.
