it
be
with
a
huge
lack
of
something
to
do
that
i
decide
to
watch
this
on
good
old
upn
on
Sunday
afternoon
,
when
the
only
good
thing
on
tv
be
the
second-rate
movie
they
show
-lrb-
some
be
good
:
they
show
''
total
recall
''
before
this
one
-rrb-
.
if
you
know
I
,
i
think
seagal
be
probably
the
most
boring
action
star
to
ever
live
.
and
this
include
keanu
reeve
.
what
do
i
hate
about
seagal
?
i
hate
how
he
use
one
facial
expression
for
every
single
threatening
and
non-threatening
situation
-lrb-
the
squint
-rrb-
.
i
hate
those
scene
in
every
movie
where
he
go
around
,
bully
people
up
,
say
stupid
line
with
a
brooklyn
accent
more
fake
than
burt
reynold
's
hairpiece
in
''
boogie
night
.
''
i
despise
how
he
never
get
a
bruise
in
any
of
he
fight
.
i
hate
how
every
single
plot
twist
lead
to
just
a
melodramatic
fight
between
he
and
the
chief
villain
.
i
hate
he
non-satirical
message
-lrb-
in
the
beginning
of
this
one
,
he
slap
on
a
quote
from
arthur
miller
,
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
film
,
except
it
be
about
brooklyn
where
this
film
take
place
-rrb-
.
and
i
hate
how
he
be
so
narcissistic
that
he
think
that
he
can
actually
fuck
sing
-lrb-
during
the
end
credit
,
he
have
a
good
old
hill
billy
rock
tune
sing
and
pen
by
he
-rrb-
.
sure
,
the
guy
's
probably
a
nice
guy
in
person
-lrb-
i
actually
find
he
very
non-threatening
when
he
be
on
letterman
not
too
long
ago
-rrb-
.
but
the
guy
make
worse
film
than
reagan
do
.
so
what
be
the
plot
of
this
shit-terpiece
?
well
...
something
about
he
try
to
catch
a
stupid-ass
crook
-lrb-
william
forsythe
-rrb-
who
shoot
and
kill
he
partner
in
broad
daylight
.
i
could
not
believe
how
bad
this
scene
be
-
the
guy
be
conveniently
with
he
family
so
we
get
the
maximum
emotional
effect
-lrb-
ahem
!
-rrb-
.
and
forsythe
even
say
some
stupid
line
to
he
before
he
take
off
.
i
be
sorry
,
do
anyone
ever
hear
of
conceal
one
's
self
?
so
in
come
ex-brooklynite
seagal
,
who
dedicate
he
life
to
catch
this
guy
.
and
i
just
wish
he
have
catch
he
in
the
beginning
,
then
end
the
film
.
but
noooo
,
this
drag
on
,
as
he
bully
forsythe
's
family
member
-lrb-
include
a
stupid
bar-owner
,
and
none
other
than
gina
gershon
as
he
other
bar-owner
sister
-rrb-
.
and
forsythe
more
than
once
threaten
he
family
.
at
one
point
,
he
actually
come
to
they
house
and
stalk
they
like
a
non-threatening
nicholson
in
''
the
shine
''
-lrb-
complete
with
they
all
hide
in
the
bathroom
,
but
with
a
add
bonus
of
one
girl
conveniently
loose
she
cool
and
scream
to
give
they
away
-rrb-
.
seagal
paint
himself
as
a
lovable
person
,
with
a
son
,
and
a
fiancee
.
he
even
show
he
hang
with
he
son
,
check
up
on
he
homework
,
and
then
about
to
take
he
out
for
a
bit
of
''
catch
,
''
when
he
be
conveniently
call
away
on
assignment
.
i
dunno
about
you
,
but
play
''
catch
''
with
seagal
be
one
of
my
childhood
nightmare
.
he
also
show
he
as
that
bad-ass
he
want
to
be
,
with
scene
of
he
bully
crook
around
,
and
take
out
people
who
be
stupid
enough
to
attack
he
even
after
he
be
unarmed
a
chinese
guy
swing
bat
with
a
pool
cue
.
serve
they
right
.
this
film
,
as
some
of
he
do
,
have
a
interesting
support
cast
of
actor
who
be
actually
talented
,
but
do
not
appear
to
be
in
this
film
.
i
already
mention
gina
gershon
-lrb-
who
be
pretty
horrible
in
this
one
-rrb-
,
as
well
as
william
forsythe
,
who
over-act
terribly
.
i
know
this
guy
can
act
:
he
be
awesome
in
''
raise
arizona
''
as
goodman
's
partner
in
crime
.
but
he
be
just
awful
here
.
jerry
orbach
give
the
only
credible
performance
in
the
film
as
the
police
chief
who
check
up
on
segal
after
thing
have
go
down
.
why
be
he
the
only
one
who
give
a
good
performance
?
well
,
because
he
role
be
small
enough
and
sporadic
enough
to
not
tarnish
he
credibility
.
he
seem
to
be
in
here
just
to
give
it
a
cool
''
law
and
order
''
feeling
-lrb-
even
if
it
be
not
a
''
cool
''
feeling
-rrb-
.
and
in
cameo
be
b-rated
erotic-thriller-cinemax-style
star
,
shannon
whirry
-lrb-
as
''
terry
malloy
,
''
which
be
more
of
a
bad
joke
than
a
clever
one
-rrb-
and
athena
massey
.
oh
!
and
''
er
''
's
julliana
margiulle
have
two
scene
.
''
out
for
justice
''
just
prove
once
again
that
american
action
film
just
suck
.
i
know
that
there
be
such
a
good
thing
as
good
action
-
he
be
call
john
woo
.
but
if
you
be
in
the
mood
for
some
good
old
no-brainer
,
fun-yet-dumb
action
,
do
not
bother
watch
this
.
it
be
so
stupid
that
it
be
boring
.
