this
movie
stink
!
although
it
be
professionally
craft
and
there
be
some
decent
performance
,
the
plot
be
so
bad
it
drag
the
film
into
the
abyss
.
i
know
i
be
in
for
trouble
when
,
during
the
opening
establishment
shot
,
we
see
a
detailed
close-up
of
warrant
officer
paul
brenner
's
-lrb-
john
travolta
-rrb-
military
identification
card
and
it
be
the
wrong
color
.
this
might
seem
like
a
minor
detail
,
but
anyone
who
have
spend
anytime
with
the
military
know
that
active
duty
identification
card
be
green
and
dependant
card
be
yellow
.
and
what
about
the
senior
military
officer
whose
uniform
shirt
be
so
wrinkled
he
look
like
he
be
a
recruit
on
he
first
day
of
training
.
or
what
about
when
brenner
tell
a
suspect
that
,
because
he
be
in
the
military
,
he
do
not
have
the
right
not
to
answer
he
question
even
though
these
rights
be
central
to
military
law
well
before
the
miranda
decision
.
how
hard
be
it
to
get
someone
familiar
with
the
military
to
check
these
fact
?
now
detail
like
this
could
be
overlook
if
the
underlie
story
hold
up
,
but
this
story
be
so
full
of
hole
it
be
painful
to
sit
through
.
for
example
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
film
,
paul
brenner
,
a
undercover
army
investigator
,
get
into
a
gun
and
knife
battle
at
he
off-post
houseboat
and
winds-up
kill
a
arm
dealer
he
have
be
investigate
.
the
local
police
investigate
the
death
be
openly
hostile
to
the
military
and
they
discover
that
brenner
have
be
lie
to
they
about
the
killing
.
but
instead
of
arrest
he
,
or
at
least
take
he
into
custody
for
further
question
,
they
release
he
.
duh
!
ultimately
,
brenner
get
assign
to
investigate
the
murder
and
possible
rape
of
the
commanding
general
's
daughter
,
a
young
captain
also
assign
to
the
post
.
when
brenner
find
graphic
sex
tape
feature
the
general
's
daughter
,
do
he
use
they
to
generate
a
suspect
list
and
begin
grill
suspect
.
no
,
he
instinct
be
to
suppress
they
because
they
might
be
potentially
embarrassing
.
eventually
,
brenner
discover
that
this
murder
be
relate
to
a
violent
gang
rape
at
west
point
eight
year
earlier
.
i
will
not
even
go
into
the
totally
unbelievable
rationale
for
the
army
's
suppression
of
this
horrendous
crime
.
i
will
just
mention
one
final
flaw
.
brenner
be
investigate
a
crime
that
occur
in
georgium
.
the
rape
occur
in
west
point
,
which
be
in
new
york
.
he
be
under
a
very
tight
-lrb-
and
totally
implausible
-rrb-
36-hour
deadline
to
solve
this
case
.
he
need
to
discuss
the
rape
with
a
psychiatrist
at
west
point
.
do
he
phone
the
doctor
?
no
,
he
travel
-lrb-
via
some
unexplained
very
fast
transport
-rrb-
to
new
york
to
question
the
psychiatrist
in
person
,
and
then
he
return
to
georgium
-lrb-
again
by
the
miracle
transport
-rrb-
,
without
once
worry
about
the
impact
any
of
this
will
have
on
he
deadline
.
you
have
be
warn
,
stay
away
from
this
one
.
