this
be
one
of
the
worst
big-screen
film
experience
i
have
have
for
a
while
.
with
this
film
,
plus
`
showgirl
'
and
`
basic
instinct
'
,
paul
verhoeven
have
stamp
himself
as
currently
one
of
the
worst
blockbuster
director
.
he
celebrated
film
`
total
recall
'
be
?
i
admit
?
successfully
script
,
but
it
nonetheless
contain
directorial
flaw
.
obviously
nobody
want
to
invest
too
much
money
in
a
production
from
someone
like
verhoeven
,
the
result
be
that
much
of
the
special
effect
in
`
starship
'
seem
fake
.
but
not
everything
bad
in
the
film
be
the
director
's
fault
,
even
though
he
be
one
of
the
guy
who
employ
the
actor
.
it
be
surprising
that
none
of
the
actor
receive
nomination
for
the
razzie
award
-lrb-
i
expect
five
for
the
act
category
-rrb-
.
casserole
vanity
devoid
,
dense
ribald
,
dingy
miasma
,
and
jackass
bushy
be
in
serious
need
of
act
school
.
no
,
they
have
to
pass
primary
school
drama
class
first
.
while
`
total
'
be
write
well
,
`
starship
'
be
purely
pathetic
.
all
right
,
it
be
suppose
to
be
a
fast-paced
entertainment
film
,
and
you
be
suppose
to
turn
off
you
intellect
-lrb-
completely
-rrb-
and
enjoy
the
action
sequence
and
special
effect
-lrb-
that
be
,
gut
and
gore
-rrb-
.
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
i
find
the
activity
incredibly
boring
,
a
complete
waste
of
more
than
two
hour
.
half
of
the
film
be
a
bad
episode
of
`
beverly
hill
90210
'
-lrb-
dina
meyer
be
in
''
beverly
hill
''
-rrb-
,
while
another
quarter
be
simply
nothing
-lrb-
thing
like
present
irrelevant
information
in
a
irritating
way
on
the
web
-rrb-
,
and
the
rest
be
a
display
of
human
fight
computer-generated
image
.
the
battle
be
all
the
same
?
jump
around
,
shoot
or
get
stab
?
and
on
barren
planet
that
only
have
giant
insect
.
there
be
not
even
any
stunt
,
which
i
consider
slightly
more
exciting
than
picture
run
around
.
i
wonder
what
the
insect
eat
,
if
there
be
nothing
but
they
on
the
planet
?
there
be
so
much
laughable
treatment
in
this
film
,
and
it
be
frankly
not
amusing
when
joke
be
intend
.
this
type
of
story
be
obviously
aim
at
10-year-old
,
who
can
not
see
it
anyway
because
of
the
violence
and
some
sexuality
.
but
then
,
there
be
always
16-year-old
who
have
that
frame
of
mind
.
the
pointless
plot
begin
when
johnny
's
-lrb-
vanity
devoid
-rrb-
girlfriend
carman
-lrb-
richard
-rrb-
decide
that
she
want
to
join
the
trooper
to
fight
the
insect
who
be
throw
asteroid
at
earth
.
johnny
then
sign
up
as
a
trooper
also
,
after
a
overacted
argument
with
he
parent
.
but
there
be
another
girl
,
dizzy
-lrb-
meyer
-rrb-
,
who
like
johnny
and
then
there
be
another
boy
who
like
carman
,
which
result
in
a
love
quadrangle
,
which
be
not
better
,
because
it
mean
augmented
worse-than-stereotyped
soap
opera
,
increase
bitchiness
,
and
more
bad
beverly
hill
+
melrose
.
and
the
result
of
this
love
quadrangle
at
the
end
be
also
rather
stupid
.
anyway
,
get
back
to
the
thing
you
might
call
plot
,
johnny
be
too
stupid
to
be
a
pilot
and
have
to
join
the
infantry
,
while
he
girl
and
the
other
dude
be
in
the
same
league
.
dizzy
come
chase
johnny
and
join
the
infantry
also
.
they
then
start
training
,
which
contain
what
roger
ebert
call
ip
-lrb-
idiot
plot
syndrome
,
moment
when
only
a
idiot
would
have
make
such
obvious
mistake
-rrb-
,
then
real
combat
.
and
guess
what
?
that
be
about
as
complex
as
it
get
.
oh
,
and
one
of
they
friend
,
carl
-lrb-
neil
patrick
harri
a
.
k
.
a
.
doogie
howser
m
.
d
.
-rrb-
,
become
involve
in
war
intelligence
,
and
he
ability
at
the
end
be
really
corny
and
make
I
want
to
spray
insecticide
on
someone
for
it
.
he
be
my
fifth
nom
for
a
razzie
.
the
trooper
fight
,
fall
in
love
,
die
,
kill
,
and
try
to
act
.
naturally
,
they
win
,
or
sort
of
half-win
.
of
course
,
in
between
-lrb-
and
at
the
end
-rrb-
there
be
soldier
chat
and
smile
while
carry
grievous
wound
cause
by
bug
leg
.
the
bug
also
suffer
from
ip
:
why
would
you
release
hold
of
you
captive
before
kill
it
?
be
not
it
also
amazing
that
earthling
have
not
invent
better
hand-held
weapon
by
then
?
the
only
question
that
remain
be
why
i
give
it
one
star
instead
of
zero
.
well
,
maybe
a-quarter
-lrb-
of
a
star
-rrb-
for
the
originality
of
the
co-sex
shower
scene
and
the
-lrb-
very
-rrb-
brief
moment
of
suspense
,
another
quarter
for
copying
`
zulu
'
and
let
the
good
guy
-lrb-
the
bug
-rrb-
win
,
and
half
a
star
for
the
sucking-out
of
the
brain
of
one
of
those
people
who
call
themselves
actor
-lrb-
but
there
should
have
be
more
,
the
trooper
deserve
to
die
-rrb-
.
