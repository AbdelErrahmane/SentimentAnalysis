the
first
scene
of
operation
condor
have
jackie
chan
prepare
for
a
secret
mission
.
he
attempt
to
pop
a
couple
of
piece
of
chew
gum
into
he
mouth
,
but
miss
.
after
they
ricochet
off
he
face
,
he
say
,
''
not
a
good
start
.
''
as
it
turn
out
,
this
line
not
only
give
foreshadow
to
the
opening
sequence
,
but
to
the
rest
of
the
movie
as
well
.
in
this
,
the
latest
of
the
jackie
chan
movie
to
be
release
in
america
after
first
run
in
hong
kong
,
chan
play
a
international
operative
codename
''
condor
''
,
and
be
task
by
the
unite
nation
with
find
a
stash
of
gold
hide
at
a
secret
base
by
the
nazus
's
during
they
retreat
across
the
saharan
desert
during
the
second
world
war
.
for
some
reason
,
condor
be
give
he
mission
at
the
u
.
s
.
embassy
in
spain
.
i
think
this
may
have
be
do
so
that
in
a
chase
scene
,
they
could
honor
the
time
old
tradition
of
knock
over
a
fruit
cart
.
watch
for
it
in
any
chase
scene
set
in
a
foreign
country
,
most
notably
in
europe
.
the
chase
will
take
itself
through
a
marketplace
,
and
a
fruit
cart
will
be
overturn
.
it
be
almost
a
guarantee
.
anyway
...
condor
be
give
a
key
which
be
suppose
to
unlock
a
giant
vault
in
which
the
gold
be
hide
;
the
problem
be
that
the
key
have
insulator
integrate
into
it
,
which
may
mean
a
booby
trap
might
be
electronically
trigger
if
the
key
be
use
improperly
.
to
help
he
figure
out
where
the
gold
be
hide
and
how
to
use
the
key
correctly
,
condor
be
accompany
by
a
desert
expert
-lrb-
carol
cheng
-rrb-
and
the
granddaughter
of
the
captain
who
be
in
charge
of
hide
the
gold
-lrb-
eva
cobo
-rrb-
.
there
be
not
suppose
to
be
any
relative
of
the
nazi
captain
living
in
spain
,
but
condor
find
the
granddaughter
by
look
she
up
in
the
phone
book
or
something
.
although
these
two
woman
be
suppose
to
be
integral
part
of
the
mission
,
they
prove
no
help
at
all
except
to
get
in
trouble
and
provide
a
excuse
for
chan
to
jump
into
he
martial
art
.
in
fact
,
most
of
the
scene
be
so
ridiculously
contrived
that
it
seem
everything
be
just
a
way
to
set
up
a
fight
.
i
suppose
this
be
not
so
bad
,
since
chan
's
action
be
really
the
best
part
of
the
movie
,
and
the
only
reason
you
go
to
see
one
of
he
film
anyway
.
if
you
have
never
see
a
jackie
chan
movie
,
do
not
expect
a
great
plot
,
but
do
expect
to
be
entertain
by
he
move
.
they
be
so
well
choreographed
and
often
so
amazing
that
you
wonder
if
this
guy
be
human
.
know
that
he
do
he
own
stunt
,
and
know
that
this
be
the
real
stuff
-lrb-
no
computer-masked
bungee
cord
here
-rrb-
make
the
action
sequence
all
the
more
exciting
.
you
have
get
to
hand
it
to
a
guy
who
be
probably
break
every
bone
in
he
body
for
the
sake
of
he
art
.
also
of
note
in
this
,
as
in
any
jackie
chan
movie
,
be
the
humor
.
as
far
as
i
know
,
none
of
he
film
take
themselves
too
seriously
,
and
even
the
dramatic
part
have
a
certain
tongue-in-cheek
quality
about
they
.
what
be
almost
masterful
be
the
way
that
humor
be
even
integrate
into
the
fight
scene
.
unlike
a
martial
art
film
such
as
anything
with
jean
claude
van
damme
,
where
the
fight
get
you
on
the
visceral
level
,
fight
scene
in
chan
's
movie
be
simply
entertaining
.
you
marvel
at
both
he
move
and
at
the
way
he
employ
they
in
such
a
way
to
make
you
laugh
.
unfortunately
,
even
chan
's
mastery
can
not
save
this
film
.
the
plot
and
character
be
so
weak
that
they
do
not
hold
the
movie
together
at
all
,
and
the
acting
be
terrible
.
carol
cheng
have
apparently
win
best
actress
honor
at
the
hong
kong
movie
award
in
the
past
,
but
since
operation
condor
be
a
dub
movie
it
kind
of
take
all
bet
off
.
this
,
combine
with
a
obviously
low
production
value
make
we
want
to
turn
away
from
the
screen
until
i
hear
those
kick
start
fly
.
