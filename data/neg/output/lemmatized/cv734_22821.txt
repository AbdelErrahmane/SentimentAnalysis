i
can
see
a
decent

struggle
to
break
free
of

`

.
it
be
a
entertaining
movie
that
offer
both
insight
and
excitement
into
the
rock-em
,
sock-em
profession
of
pro
football
.
unfortunately
,
the
director
seem
to
have
only
one
priority
on
he
mind
:
spruce
up
the
film
with
a
assortment
of
fancy
camera
maneuver
.
in
alter
each
frame
with
quick-flash
photography
and
dizzying
,
in-your-face
editing
,
stone
appear
to
have
completely
ignore
the
matter
of
plausible
character
development
and
football
politics
.
we
see
glimpse
of
greatness
,
but

tiresome
and

the
problem
with

visual
approach
be
this
:
he
use
extravagant

a

conventional
approach
would
have

football

seem
to
think

only
add
to

`

a
