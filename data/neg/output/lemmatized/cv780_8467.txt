sometimes
i
wonder
just
what
the
censor
be
think
.
take
this
film
,
''
naked
killer
''
,
among
it
be
ingredient
be
heavy
dose
of
violence
,
rape
sequence
,
straight
and
lesbian
sex
scene
and
what
we
system
call
''
coarse
language
''
.
but
what
do
those
intelligent
people
at
the
censorship
bureau
choose
to
remove
in
case
someone
will
get
offend
?
one
word
-
penis
.
that
be
it
.
in
spite
of
everything
else
in
the
movie
the
one
thing
that
the
censor
decide
be
too
much
be
''
penis
.
''
.
it
really
restore
you
be
faith
in
the
system
,
huh
?
anyway
,
that
be
just
a
side
point
.
when
naked
killer
be
release
in
the
local
independent
cinema
around
melbourne
,
it
be
advertise
ad
nausuem
as
a
hip
,
cool
,
controversial
thriller
.
what
they
forget
to
mention
be
that
it
be
not
very
good
.
the
plot
involve
male
cop
tinam
-lrb-
simon
yam
-rrb-
,
investigate
a
series
of
brutal
murder
.
while
get
a
haircut
he
meet
and
find
himself
attract
to
a
girl
name
kitty
-lrb-
chingmy
yau
-rrb-
,
who
,
after
extract
revenge
on
the
man
who
kill
she
father
,
fall
in
with
professional
killer
sister
cindy
-lrb-
svenwara
madoka
-rrb-
.
realize
kitty
have
potential
,
cindy
decide
to
train
kitty
in
several
unusual
and
ridiculous
way
and
give
she
a
new
identity
.
however
in
the
course
of
he
investigation
tinam
-lrb-
who
believe
kitty
have
disappear
-rrb-
,
run
into
she
again
,
but
be
not
quite
sure
if
it
be
she
.
to
complicate
matter
the
actual
serial
killler
,
princess
and
baby
,
who
a
former
student
of
cindy
,
and
have
be
tell
to
kill
they
old
master
and
she
new
student
.
from
then
the
action
ensue
...
all
in
all
,
this
be
not
a
well
do
movie
.
the
script
be
awful
,
the
direction
all
over
the
place
,
the
editing
be
jerky
and
confusing
and
the
subtitle
be
surprisingly
poor
.
however
the
be
a
few
stand
alone
piece
that
do
entertain
.
the
shoot
out
in
the
car
park
be
almost
woo-like
in
adrenaline
.
the
fight
scene
be
energetic
and
i
guess
it
must
get
a
few
point
for
try
something
a
little
different
.
let
I
put
this
way
,
if
you
like
action
-
get
something
else
,
if
you
like
strong
woman
in
movie
-
get
something
else
,
if
you
have
do
decide
between
this
and
''
black
cat
''
for
you
hong
kong
female
action
-
do
not
get
either
.
even
for
curiosity
value
it
just
be
not
worth
it
.
let
's
face
it
-
if
ever
the
be
a
movie
that
become
popular
on
it
be
subject
alone
,
this
be
it
.
