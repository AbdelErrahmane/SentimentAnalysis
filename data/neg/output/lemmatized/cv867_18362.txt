whenever
u

s
.
government
start
meddle
into
other
country
'
affair
,
under
the
pretext
of
support
human
rights
or
prevent
political
,
religious
or
ethnic
persecution
,
the
other
side
be
ready
to
use
mantra
that
say
''
look
who
be
talk
!
what
have
you
do
to
the
indian
?
''
however
,
even
the
american
themselves
be
ready
to
use
that
dark
chapter
of
they
own
national
history
when
it
suit
they
purpose
.
hollywood
be
just
another
example
,
with
its
revisionist
western
,
make
in
early
1990
.
those
movie
try
to
exploit
the
emerge
wave
of
political
correctness
,
coincide
with
the
500th
anniversary
of
columbus
'
discovery
of
america
.
one
of
such
example
be
geronimo
:
a
american
legend
,
1993
western
direct
by
walter
hill
,
film
that
deal
with
one
of
the
last
conflict
between
american
native
and
white
settler
.
the
hero
of
the
film
be
geronimo
-lrb-
play
by
we
studus
-rrb-
,
leader
of
apach
,
fierce
warrior
tribe
that
use
to
give
hard
time
to
white
settler
during
the
second
half
of
19th
century
.
when
the
movie
begin
,
in
1885
,
geronimo
and
he
apach
make
peace
with
u
.
s
.
government
and
try
to
live
peacefully
in
arizona
reservation
.
however
,
broken
promise
,
injustice
and
violence
against
he
people
would
make
geronimo
restless
.
with
not
more
30
or
so
of
he
follower
,
he
escape
reservation
and
begin
guerrilla
campaign
.
general
crook
-lrb-
gene
hackman
-rrb-
,
commander
of
u
.
s
.
army
force
,
respect
geronimo
and
know
that
even
he
5
,
000
force
be
not
enough
to
catch
geronimo
in
the
great
space
of
the
american
southwest
.
instead
,
he
turn
to
people
who
be
more
experienced
with
apach
-
lt
.
charle
gatewood
-lrb-
jason
patric
-rrb-
and
indian
hunter
al

-lrb-
robert
duvall
-rrb-
.
together
with
young
lt

britton
davi
-lrb-
matt

-rrb-
they
would
begin
mission
aim
at
capture
geronimo
.
geronimo
:
a
american
legend
,
like
many
movie
make
under
the
shadow
of
political
correctness
,
try
to
tell
the
tale
about
oppressed
minority
,
but
instead
the
real
subject
be
the
bad
conscience
of
the
oppressor
.
so
,
the
story
about
geronimo
be
tell
from
the
perspective
of
he
enemy
.
almost
all
of
they
happen
to
be
he
greatest
admirer
and
use
every
opportunity
to
express
how
sorry
they
feel
for
have
to
fight
he
and
he
people
.
although
such
element
of
john
millius
'
screenplay
do
indeed
have
some
basis
in
history
,
they
harm
the
story
of
geronimo
.
to
be
honest
,
walter
hill
do
try
to
make
geronimo
the
real
hero
of
the
film
,
but
the
movie
segment
that
deal
with
the
plight
of
apach
and
the
uprising
be
give
too
little
time
.
instead
,
they
turn
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
the
back
story
for
rather
uninteresting
adventure
story
of
gatewood
and
he
band
.
to
make
even
worse
,
hill
have
some
real
problem
with
pacing
and
style
,
and
in
the
end
we
have
impression
that
we
be
watch
two
film
badly
edit
into
one
-
story
about
geronimo
and
story
about
he
pursuer
.
the
movie
should
have
be
better
if
it
turn
to
geronimo
's
life
before
and
after
he
last
uprising
,
in
many
way
more
interesting
than
the
story
about
gatewood
.
the
difference
between
those
segment
could
be
observe
through
the
different
quality
of
act
.
we
studus
,
cherokee
actor
who
be
so
impressive
as
magua
in
the
last
of
the
mohican
,
be
perfect
choice
for
geronimo
,
not
only
because
he
resemble
geronimo
,
but
because
he
induce
a
lot
of
passion
in
he
role
.
contrary
to
he
,
we
have
disinterested
actor
who
sleepwalk
through
the
role
of
he
white
enemy
.
while
this
could
be
expect
from
someone
like
jason
patric
,
it
be
shame
when
we
have
veteran
like
gene
hackman
or
robert
duvall
.
even
hill
's
directing
be
bellow
expectation
-
battle
scene
be
too
short
and
,
like
in
many
of
he
late
film
,
force
viewer
to
ask
what
have
happen
to
the
great
action
director
of
1970s
.
even
he
old
associate
,
music
composer
ry
cooder
,
disappoint
,
with
the
score
that
shift
between
indian
motive
and
classic
.
on
the
other
hand
,
photography
by
lloyd
ahern
ii
,
with
the
use
of
red
lens
,
give
somewhat
dreamy
atmosphere
,
ideal
for
this
movie
that
be
suppose
to
be
melancholic
epic
.
all
in
all
,
compare
with
some
of
the
hollywood
's
example
of
political
correctness
,
this
film
be
not
so
bad
,
but
we
be
leave
with
the
unpleasant
impression
that
it
could
have
be
better
.
