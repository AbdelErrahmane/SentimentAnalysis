star
william
baldwin
;
cindy
crawford
&
steven
berkoff
all
right
,
the
first
problem
that
fair
game
have
be
the
casting
of
supermodel
cindy
crawford
in
the
lead
role
.
not
that
cindy
do
that
bad
,
it
be
just
that
anyone
who
watch
this
film
know
from
moment
one
that
that
little
bit
of
casting
be
not
do
because
of
cindy
's
extraordinary
act
skill
,
but
for
she
extraordinary
ability
to
look
drop
dead
gorgeous
in
any
situation
.
and
in
fair
game
most
situation
tend
to
find
cindy
either
soak
wet
or
very
hot
and
sweaty
,
but
i
be
sure
that
that
be
just
a
coincidence
,
no
doubt
that
these
situation
be
essential
to
the
plot
and
the
fact
that
cindy
look
great
wet
,
well
,
that
be
just
a
happy
coincidence
.
sure
.
william
baldwin
be
not
a
bad
actor
.
unfortunately
,
he
just
do
not
demonstrate
it
at
all
in
this
movie
.
i
be
not
sure
if
that
be
because
most
of
he
line
be
just
so
hokey
,
or
if
he
be
try
to
make
cindy
's
act
look
good
.
if
it
be
the
latter
,
it
work
.
cindy
do
a
surprisingly
good
job
here
in
she
first
movie
.
which
be
not
to
say
that
she
do
not
have
room
for
improvement
.
although
to
be
fair
to
cindy
,
she
line
be
kinda
cheesy
in
place
.
so
right
about
now
you
be
no
doubt
ask
yourself
what
sort
of
movie
do
cindy
crawford
,
arguably
the
most
beautiful
woman
on
the
planet
,
choose
for
she
foray
into
the
world
of
cinema
?
well
,
i
be
glad
you
ask
that
question
.
cindy
play
a
lawyer
who
by
some
convoluted
plot
twist
become
a
target
for
former
elite
kgb
agent
.
why
woud
they
target
someone
as
likable
as
cindy
,
you
ask
?
by
the
end
of
the
movie
you
will
not
care
.
the
story
be
so
contrived
it
be
not
funny
.
anyway
after
cindy
get
blow
out
of
the
window
of
she
house
,
without
get
so
much
as
a
scratch
i
might
add
,
she
be
place
into
protective
police
custody
under
the
watchful
eve
of
william
baldwin
.
who
be
character
,
max
kilpatric
,
a
police
detective
,
seem
to
possess
the
skill
of
some
sort
of
fight
machine
-lrb-
my
guess
be
that
the
writer
have
see
way
too
many
of
steven
seagal
's
early
film
-rrb-
.
the
point
be
that
the
idea
of
the
crawford
and
baldwin
's
character
of
the
run
from
these
killer
russian
be
not
all
that
bad
of
a
idea
,
it
be
just
everything
around
that
basic
idea
which
kinda
stink
out
loud
.
the
support
cast
member
be
nothing
more
that
over
act
stereotype
.
if
i
be
baldwin
,
i
would
hope
this
film
disappear
.
as
for
crawford
,
she
may
indeed
have
some
act
ability
.
unfortunately
,
any
she
do
have
be
obscure
by
write
that
go
beyond
bad
.
this
movie
be
obviously
write
with
cindy
in
mind
,
since
the
writer
spend
most
of
they
time
find
way
to
capitalize
off
of
she
look
.
it
be
too
bad
they
have
not
spend
more
time
on
a
half
decent
plot
,
since
m
.
crawford
be
more
than
capable
of
look
just
fine
all
by
herself
thank
you
very
much
.
unless
you
be
a
huge
fan
of
either
baldwin
or
crawford
this
be
a
movie
that
will
only
disappoint
you
.
