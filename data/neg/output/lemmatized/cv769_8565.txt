phew
,
what
a
mess
!
for
he
fifth
collaboration
with
director
rich
-
ard
donner
-lrb-
lethal
weapon
i-iii
,
maverick
-rrb-
,
mel
gibson
play
a
motormouth
,
maybe
mentally
ill
new
york
city
cabbie
,
jerry
,
whose
wild
conspiracy
theory
be
all
but
ignore
by
alice
-lrb-
julium
robert
,
act
all
serious
-rrb-
,
the
justice
department
employee
that
he
have
a
crush
on
.
she
not
interested
,
but
another
person
be
:
a
cium
psychiatrist
-lrb-
patrick
stewart
-rrb-
who
promptly
kidnap
he
.
be
one
of
jerry
's
conjecture
correct
?
\*
be
\*
the
metal
strip
in
the
new
$
100
bill
be
use
to
track
you
movement
?
be
oliver
stone
still
alive
,
because
he
cut
a
deal
with
george
bush
to
spread
\*
dis
\*
information
?
be
this
movie
really
about
\*
any
\*
of
the
crazed
cabbie
's
theory
?
no
,
no
,
and
no
.
as
it
turn
out
,
there
be
some
other
nonsense
go
on
here
,
involve
and
revolve
around
jerry
's
background
.
-lrb-
hint
:
pay
attention
to
a
early
scene
where
jerry
black
out
and
flash
back
,
in
quick
succession
,
to
image
of
a
interrogation
room
,
hypodermic
needle
,
and
m
.
robert
herself
.
-rrb-
the
\*
initial
\*
premise
be
pretty
good
and
be
play
,
for
a
while
,
at
a
delightfully
dizzying
clip
.
mel
be
wider-open
that
we
have
ever
see
he
and
,
if
he
character
's
relationship
with
robert
'
initially
strain
credibility
,
they
combine
star
power
be
blissfully
intoxicating
.
-lrb-
the
highest
wattage
of
the
summer
,
perhaps
?
-rrb-
even
when
the
plot
contrivance
begin
to
intrude
,
the
two
remain
a
randy
dandy
screen
pair
.
there
be
a
great
scene
in
jerry
's
fortress
,
er
,
apartment
,
with
alice
try
to
act
casual
as
she
hyperactive
host
try
to
remember
the
combination
to
a
lock
coffee
bean
container
.
-lrb-
which
he
store
in
another
lock
con
-
tainer
,
he
fridge
.
-rrb-
other
hilarious
moment
,
of
which
there
be
many
,
include
a
trio
of
memorable
convention-breaker
,
where
alice
ditch
a
tail
,
jerry
cold-cock
someone
,
and
,
later
,
elude
a
foot
pursuit
,
each
in
a
uproariously
unexpected
fashion
.
-lrb-
that
be
donner
's
own
ladyhawke
playing
in
the
theater
,
btw
.
-rrb-
let
's
see
,
other
pleasure
include
...
a
brilliant
title
sequence
,
a
jazzy
score
from
carter
burwell
,
and
the
worth-paying-to-see
sight
of
robert
pump
lead
into
one
bad
guy
and
slam
another
's
head
into
a
wall
.
oh
,
pretty
woman
!
get
to
the
latter
,
however
,
require
slog
through
a
increasingly
overburdened
and
ultimately
unappealing
story
.
the
last
hour
of
conspiracy
theory
devolve
from
tolerable
to
torturous
to
almost
unwatchable
.
more
stuff
happen
of
the
stupid
shit
variety
than
be
worth
mention
here
,
except
,
perhaps
,
for
a
late
sequence
that
have
alice
locate
jerry
in
a
abandoned
wing
of
a
mental
hospital
by
hear
he
voice
carry
through
the
air
duct
.
and
here
i
think
it
be
wabbit
season
.
good
god
,
who
rewrite
these
movie
?
and
do
they
arrive
in
nondescript
black
vehicle
?
