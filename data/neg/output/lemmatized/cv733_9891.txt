contrary
to
popular
belief
,
not
every
single
foregin
film
release
to
a
american
market
be
a
masterpiece
.
some
of
they
be
not
even
good
.
some
example
of
this
principle
be
the
aboslutely
dreadful
''
un
indien
dans
la
ville
''
-lrb-
present
as
''
little
indian
,
big
city
,
''
and
remake
into
that
crap
tim
allen
flick
,
''
jungle2jungle
''
-rrb-
,
and
this
.
what
could
have
be
a
clever
little
sex
comedy
turn
into
one
mess
of
a
french
flick
.
''
french
twist
''
-lrb-
the
''
cool
''
american
title
,
not
the
real
one
,
which
be
''
gazon
maudit
,
''
literally
mean
''
twist
ground
,
''
or
something
like
that
-rrb-
deal
with
a
married
couple
with
kid
,
and
the
intrusion
of
a
stranger
who
kinda
screw
thing
up
for
they
.
lolus
and
alain
chabat
-lrb-
victorium
abril
and
alain
chabat
-rrb-
be
not
exactly
happily
marry
.
always
on
business
trip
,
alain
chabat
more
than
once
cheat
on
she
,
and
she
eventually
find
out
.
and
one
day
,
she
meet
a
butch
mechanic
,
marijo
-lrb-
the
co-writer\/director
josiane
balasko
-rrb-
,
and
they
two
kinda
hit
it
off
.
so
she
decide
she
will
get
back
at
alain
chabat
by
do
the
obvious
:
sleep
with
marijo
.
but
she
soon
start
to
not
only
fall
in
love
with
marijo
,
but
she
be
also
realize
she
be
still
in
love
with
alain
chabat
.
so
,
of
course
,
she
do
the
obvious
from
that
:
she
decide
to
keep
they
both
.
she
'll
be
-lrb-
and
sleep
-rrb-
with
each
of
they
for
3
day
each
,
then
on
Sunday
,
she
'll
rest
by
herself
.
after
all
,
she
need
it
if
she
be
gonna
have
more
sex
than
sylvium
kristel
.
the
film
go
on
for
over
a
hour
and
a
half
,
through
stupidity
after
stupidity
,
moronic
twist
after
moronic
twist
,
and
soon
there
be
the
little
ironic
-lrb-
!
!
!
-rrb-
end
.
i
know
it
be
a
completely
different
culture
,
and
i
be
quite
familiar
with
the
french
and
they
cinema
,
but
this
be
just
bad
.
none
of
the
character
be
more
intelligent
than
peter
stormare
in
''
fargo
''
-lrb-
a
movie
where
stupid
character
be
back
up
to
make
a
point
-rrb-
,
and
any
action
they
do
be
pretty
much
just
to
get
a
hopeful
chuckle
from
the
audience
.
what
be
shocking
be
this
be
not
only
one
of
france
's
biggest
hit
,
but
it
be
nominate
for
a
lot
of
cesar
-lrb-
french
equivalent
of
oscar
-rrb-
.
the
writing
and
directing
be
really
the
big
problem
with
it
.
josiane
balasko
do
a
good
act
job
with
she
role
,
but
she
little
sex
comedy
be
not
very
humerous
,
entertaining
,
or
even
deep
at
all
.
even
woody
allen
's
not-very-good
''
a
midsummer
night
's
sex
comedy
''
be
intelligent
,
well-written
,
and
possess
some
depth
.
this
be
shallow
,
unfunny
,
and
pretty
annoying
to
watch
.
the
film
move
at
the
pace
of
a
snail
,
and
be
damn-near
painful
to
watch
.
thank
god
for
the
fast
forward
button
.
the
act
,
however
,
be
not
bad
at
all
.
the
actor
do
the
best
they
can
with
the
bad
material
,
and
victorium
abril
be
pretty
likable
despite
the
script
-lrb-
and
the
fact
that
she
be
stupid
enough
to
try
to
divide
herself
over
two
people
when
she
have
kid
-rrb-
.
and
alain
chabat
have
some
funny
moment
as
the
neurotic
husband
.
but
''
french
twist
''
be
just
pretty
lame
.
it
be
not
overly
horrible
,
and
have
a
couple
very
,
very
,
very
brief
moment
.
but
it
be
just
a
really
crap
film
,
and
a
example
of
a
ill-advised
distribution
of
a
foreign
film
.
