''
the

be
a
structurally
confusing
film
that
i
can
only
describe
have
have
multiple
personality
disorder
.
every
forty
minute
of
this
two-hour
film
begin
with
a
new
theme
,
virtually
discard
what
have
be
set
up
in
the
precede
act
.
it
start
off
purposefully
as
a
film
about
a
innocent
man
seek
new
thrill
in
a
dangerous
environment
.
but
then
in
the
second
act
,
the
mood
of
the
film
abruptly
change
and
it
become
a
story
about
a
love
triangle
on
a
idyllic
island
paradise
that
evoke
vision
of
''
blue
lagoon
''
.
forty
minute
later
,
the
mood
change
once
more
,
and
it
become
a
dumb
down
version
of
''
lord
of
the
fly
''
where
a
isolate
community
be
discover
,
where
they
moral
code
tout
maintain
a
sense
of
bliss
at
all
cost
.
by
the
time
it
be
over
,
you
can
only
scratch
you
head
and
wonder
what
this
film
be
really
mean
to
be
about
.
the
main
character
of
''
the
beach
''
be
angst-ridden
richard
-lrb-
leonardo
dicaprio
-rrb-
.
he
travel
to
the
netherworld
of
bangkok
where
back
alley
merchant
push
they
wares
upon
unsuspecting
tourist
and
scantily
clad
woman
brazenly
ask
if
you
be
look
for
a
good
time
.
richard
's
voice-over
tell
the
audience
that
he
have
come
to
this
place
because
he
be
bore
with
he
life
and
feel
that
one
way
to
reinvigorate
himself
be
to
let
go
of
the
familiar
and
to
enter
into
a
world
of
the
unknown
.
this
seedy
environment
be
just
what
richard
be
look
for
.
he
check
into
a
fleabag
hotel
where
he
meet
the
crazed
daffy
-lrb-
robert
carlisle
-rrb-
.
he
seem
like
a
rave
lunatic
,
obviously
high
from
heavy
drug
use
and
look
as
if
he
be
afflict
with
some
sort
of
psychosis
.
though
he
jagged
behavior
would
distress
most
of
we
,
richard
listen
to
he
as
he
speak
of
a
mysterious
island
that
contain
the
most
perfect
beach
that
anyone
have
ever
see
.
moreover
,
the
island
itself
flourish
with
enough
hemp
plant
that
can
make
a
small
city
high
for
life
.
captivate
by
the
idea
,
he
ask
two
other
hotel
guest
to
join
he
on
he
journey
.
they
be
worldly
etienne
and
the
alluring
francoise
,
who
have
also
come
to
thailand
for
reason
similar
to
richard
's
.
once
they
finally
arrive
at
this
paradise
,
however
,
the
mood
of
the
story
shift
to
richard
's
grow
desire
for
francoise
.
this
particular
plot
point
be
weak
at
best
because
there
be
absolutely
no
question
in
my
mind
that
francoise
will
wind
up
with
richard
.
etienne
be
about
as
exciting
as
fluffy
,
white
sand
.
it
be
odd
that
etienne
never
see
this
come
,
but
paradise
have
a
way
of
hide
potential
threat
just
out
of
view
.
and
once
the
three
stumble
across
the
hidden
community
-lrb-
mood
shift
imminent
-rrb-
,
more
event
transpire
that
depict
its
hidden
danger
.
for
example
,
there
be
marijuana
field
close
by
patrol
by
armed
guard
.
and
the
lagoon
in
which
they
swim
invite
the
occasional
shark
.
there
be
several
idea
that
be
introduce
in
''
the
beach
''
and
each
one
could
merit
its
own
feature-length
film
.
there
be
the
man
vs
.
nature
angle
,
the
love
triangle
angle
,
and
the
utopia-gone-awry
angle
.
but
the
film
meander
so
tremendously
that
its
entire
purpose
become
blur
.
dicaprio
,
as
a
result
,
have
a
almost
impossible
time
of
try
to
embody
the
different
state
of
mind
that
he
and
the
film
go
through
.
consequently
,
the
audience
have
a
equally
difficult
time
try
to
keep
up
.
