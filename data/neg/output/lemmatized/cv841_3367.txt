a
movie
about
divorce
and
custody
in
1995
seem
about
as
timely
as
a
movie
about
mood
ring
.
family
breakup
have
be
a
all
too
familiar
part
of
the
american
landscape
for
nearly
thirty
year
,
and
countless
drama
have
tell
story
of
acrimonious
court
battle
in
hand-wringing
detail
.
still
,
i
can
not
recall
a
comedy
about
the
subject
before
bye
bye
love
.
and
after
it
,
i
still
can
not
.
bye
bye
love
be
rarely
funny
,
more
often
a
weak
and
melodramatic
retread
of
common
tv-movie
fare
.
only
a
few
moment
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
film
's
main
premise
offer
big
laugh
instead
of
cliched
emotion
.
bye
bye
love
follow
one
weekend
in
the
life
of
three
divorce
father
who
get
weekend
custody
of
they
child
.
dave
-lrb-
matthew
modine
-rrb-
,
a
father
of
two
,
be
a
inveterate
womanizer
have
difficulty
stay
faithful
to
he
latest
girlfriend
;
vic
-lrb-
randy
quaid
-rrb-
be
a
foul-humored
father
of
three
about
to
go
on
a
rare
date
;
donny
-lrb-
paul
reiser
-rrb-
pine
for
he
ex-wife
and
have
trouble
relate
to
he
teenage
daughter
emma
-lrb-
eliza
dushku
-rrb-
.
over
the
course
of
the
weekend
,
the
three
man
face
various
crisis
,
include
vic
's
blind
date
from
hell
-lrb-
janeane
garofolo
-rrb-
and
donny
's
grow
estrangement
from
emma
.
the
three
lead
actor
form
a
rather
unlikely
combo
,
and
the
quality
of
they
performance
be
of
widely
vary
quality
.
randy
quaid
be
the
best
of
the
three
,
bitter
without
be
irritating
,
gleefully
spiteful
without
be
frightening
.
he
run-in
with
be
ex-wife
-lrb-
lindsey
crouse
-rrb-
be
a
bit
over-played
,
though
,
and
he
confrontation
with
a
pompous
radio
psychologist
-lrb-
rob
reiner
-rrb-
be
gimmicky
and
implausible
.
he
do
get
bye
bye
love
's
best
sub-plot
,
a
hilarious
dinner
date
with
a
gloriously
demented
janeane
garofolo
,
and
he
do
a
great
slow
burn
.
paul
reiser
really
have
only
one
character
,
he
slightly
befuddle
,
uptight
nice
guy
''
mad
about
you
''
persona
,
but
he
do
it
well
.
as
a
personality
,
he
be
appeal
,
but
as
a
character
,
he
become
pretty
boring
here
.
matthew
modine
,
be
,
quite
simply
,
terrible
.
this
be
not
a
performance
good
enough
to
be
call
mailed-in
;
he
even
forget
to
put
a
stamp
on
it
.
modine
lack
any
charm
in
a
appallingly
under-written
role
,
look
bored
most
of
the
time
,
and
get
stick
with
a
trite
little
speech
about
how
it
be
all
he
father
's
fault
he
be
such
a
cad
.
carolco
's
executive
,
whose
entire
future
be
rest
on
modine
's
bankability
for
the
upcome
cutthroat
island
,
must
be
sweating
bucket
right
now
.
bye
bye
love
basically
come
off
as
a
very
confused
movie
,
because
it
spend
far
too
much
of
its
time
on
the
new
relationship
of
its
main
character
instead
of
on
the
relationship
between
the
father
and
they
kid
,
make
it
just
another
''
date
in
the
90
''
movie
.
when
the
movie
do
deal
with
the
child
at
all
,
it
be
to
have
one
of
they
scream
out
a
accusation
and\/or
cry
,
perhaps
to
be
resolve
later
by
a
sensitive
talk
and
a
hug
,
perhaps
not
.
even
more
confusing
be
a
sub-plot
feature
the
late
ed
flander
as
a
widower
who
go
to
work
and
a
mcdonald
's
and
befriend
a
troubled
youth
.
it
be
a
sad
end
to
flander
'
career
,
get
catch
up
in
a
truly
annoying
over-use
of
mcdonald
's
as
a
location
,
a
plot
device
and
,
apparently
,
a
major
advertiser
.
even
if
bye
bye
love
have
decide
to
spend
its
time
focus
exclusively
on
the
parent-child
relationship
,
it
still
would
have
be
pretty
difficult
to
pull
off
,
because
ultimately
there
be
very
little
humor
one
can
wring
from
family
break-up
and
they
effect
on
child
.
any
way
you
slice
it
,
it
be
a
bad
situation
for
kid
,
and
the
maker
of
bye
bye
love
mostly
go
for
the
heartstrings
when
deal
with
the
single
parenting
issue
.
it
be
leave
to
the
dad
'
romantic
fumbling
to
probide
what
little
humor
there
be
,
and
it
be
not
enough
.
there
have
be
comparison
between
bye
bye
love
and
parenthood
,
but
parenthood
be
both
genuinely
funny
and
genuinely
touching
.
bye
bye
love
be
a
genuine
shame
.
