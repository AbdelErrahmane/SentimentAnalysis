do
the
folk
at
disney
have
no
common
decency
?
they
have
resurrect
yet
another
cartoon
and
turn
it
into
a
live
action
hodgepodge
of
expensive
special
effect
,
embarrassing
writing
and
kid-friendly
slapstick
.
be
not
mr
.
magoo
enough
,
people
?
obviously
not
.
inspector
gadget
be
not
what
i
would
call
ideal
family
entertainment
.
younger
viewer
will
likely
be
take
in
by
the
abound
goofiness
,
but
they
adult
companion
may
feel
a
wave
of
nausea
sweeping
over
they
as
they
attempt
to
endure
this
appalling
80-minute
exercise
in
glaring
stupidity
.
the
movie
be
poorly
edit
,
grossly
manipulative
,
and
the
finish
product
resemble
somewhat
of
a
fail
jigsaw
puzzle
.
all
the
element
be
there
,
but
the
manner
in
which
director
david
kellogg
piece
they
together
be
laughable
and
trite
.
as
a
huge
fan
of
the
80
's
animated
tv
show
,
the
first
thing
i
must
express
be
my
anger
toward
the
treatment
of
the
main
villain
.
in
the
cartoon
,
dr
.
claw
be
a
frightening
,
raspy-voiced
presence
who
remain
a
total
mystery
to
the
viewer
.
we
never
see
he
face
;
he
simply
sit
back
in
he
arm-chair
,
watch
surveillance
camera
and
gently
stroke
he
loyal
cat
.
as
a
child
,
i
always
imagine
what
dr
.
claw
would
appear
as
-
and
this
curiosity
keep
I
watch
for
many
year
.
with
the
release
of
the
live-action
movie
,
the
face
of
this
once
intriguing
villain
have
be
unrightfully
expose
-
it
be
...
rupert
everett
?
!
only
now
,
dr
.
claw
be
simply
know
as
claw
-lrb-
`
one
word
,
'
he
explain
,
`
like
madonna
'
-rrb-
.
he
sport
a
shiny
clamp
instead
of
the
steel
glove
,
and
seem
far
less
interesting
than
the
animated
version
.
it
help
that
the
dash
everett
be
enthusiastic
,
but
he
overplay
the
role
entirely
too
far
.
when
all
be
say
and
do
,
this
be
not
a
very
wise
move
on
the
part
of
the
screenwriter
-
the
infamous
dr
.
claw
have
be
turn
into
a
wisecracking
game
show
host
who
make
cheap
attempt
at
be
suave
and
cool
.
he
do
still
have
he
cat
,
though
.
in
the
title
role
,
matthew
broderick
look
lose
.
the
actor
,
while
usually
downright
charming
,
do
not
know
exactly
where
to
take
he
character
-
a
fault
that
again
can
be
blame
on
the
hapless
writer
.
broderick
first
play
a
friendly
,
naive
security
guard
name
john
brown
,
who
dream
of
become
a
cop
and
uphold
the
law
for
the
good
of
the
people
.
he
have
a
mad
crush
on
pretty
scientist
brenda
-lrb-
joely
fisher
-rrb-
,
who
have
stumble
upon
a
new
wave
of
technology
involve
the
interaction
of
human
tissue
and
electronics
.
but
one
fateful
night
,
she
lab
be
destroy
and
she
experiment
be
steal
by
a
fiendish
millionaire
-lrb-
everett
-rrb-
who
want
to
take
over
the
world
.
john
courageously
pursue
the
limousine
from
the
scene
of
the
crime
,
but
lose
the
chase
when
he
vehicle
burst
into
flame
.
in
a
full
body
cast
,
he
be
choose
to
be
the
first
human
prototype
for
brenda
's
work
;
a
revolutionary
crime
fight
tool
with
numerous
fancy
gadget
to
dispatch
bad
guy
.
and
so
be
bear
inspector
gadget
.
as
bad
as
this
movie
be
,
it
do
have
a
certain
charm
in
isolate
scene
.
broderick
actually
fare
better
playing
robo
gadget
,
a
evil
and
destructive
clone
that
claw
have
set
loose
on
the
city
.
and
there
be
about
two
or
three
amusing
punch
line
,
the
funniest
be
when
robo
gadget
impersonate
a
rampage
monster
with
shadow
puppet
on
a
brick
wall
,
and
a
japanese
man
flee
the
scene
while
scream
,
`
this
be
why
i
leave
tokyo
!
'
alas
,
the
hit
ratio
of
the
ongoing
gag
be
about
20
to
1
in
favor
of
not
even
crack
a
slight
giggle
.
there
be
so
many
tired
plot
addition

gadget

hughley
-rrb-
be
the
same
type
of
character
as
zoot
the
suit
from
my
favorite
martian
.
both
be
wisecrack
,
non-human
addition
design
to
coax
laughter
from
smaller
child
.
well
,
it
just
do
not
work
-lrb-
in
fact
,

function
marvelously
in

to
this
-rrb-
.
and
do

even
get
I
start
about
the
villain
.
i
do
not
mind
everett
's
performance
,
but
he
bumble
assistant
will
make
every
adult
cringe
with
disgust
.
the
character
from
the
cartoon
have
be
reduce
to
thankless
support
role
.
penny
-lrb-
michelle
trachtenberg
-rrb-
and
brain
the
dog
now
have
little
to
do
with
the
action
,
and
chief
quimby
-lrb-
dabney
coleman
-rrb-
have
lose
considerable
appeal
in
the
transition
of
animation
to
live
action
.
the
special
effect
be
everywhere
,
but
not
so
annoying
they
will
cause
you
eye
to
peel
over
.
the
problem
here
lie
solely
in
the
script
.
perhaps
the
next
time
disney
attempt
a
remake
like
this
,
they
will
invest
more
in
the
screenplay
than
the
fancy-schmancy
visual
.
here
be
one
critic
cross
he
finger
,
anyway
.
