battlefield
earth
be
the
worst
film
of
2000
,
and
i
guarantee
you
that
nothing
else
this
year
will
even
come
close
.
in
fact
,
i
'll
be
surprise
if
i
see
anything
this
bad
in
the
next
ten
year
.
base
on
the
novel
by
scientology
guru
l
.
ron
hubbard
,
battlefield
earth
begin
and
we
immediately
find
out
two
piece
of
key
information
.
it
be
the
year
3000
,
and
a
alien
race
call
the
psychlo
-lrb-
which
sound
like
a
tag
team
of
mexican
wrestler
-rrb-
conquer
we
planet
in
nine
minute
.
ok
,
we
be
all
of
10
seconds
in
and
i
have
a
zillion
question
race
through
my
mind
.
when
be
we
conquer
?
the
audience
be
lead
to
believe
that
this
happen
about
1
,
000
year
earlier
,
and
if
that
be
the
case
then
we
be
go
to
get
into
a
whole
bunch
of
problem
later
-lrb-
trust
I
...
keep
reading
-rrb-
.
also
,
why
do
not
we
get
to
see
earth
get
conquer
?
how
the
hell
do
you
make
a
popcorn
sci-fi
flick
and
not
deliver
the
goods
on
the
one
event
that
set
up
the
film
?
human
now
live
as
caveman
or
slave
labor
,
and
for
the
film
's
first
act
we
focus
on
one
particular
caveman
group
outside
of
denver
,
colorado
.
they
grunt
and
groan
and
babble
about
monster
.
so
,
when
the
psychlo
conquer
earth
,
be
the
only
human
not
capture
a
herd
of
newborn
baby
that
crawl
they
way
to
safety
in
the
hill
?
none
of
these
character
have
any
knowledge
of
the
planet
be
conquer
-lrb-
whenever
that
be
-rrb-
.
this
be
definitely
not
the
way
to
start
a
action\/sci-fi
film
.
one
of
the
human
wander
out
into
the
wilderness
and
stumble
across
what
he
think
be
a
monster
,
and
he
begin
to
fight
it
.
the
''
monster
''
turn
out
to
be
a
dinosaur
from
a
old
miniature
golf
course
.
he
turn
around
and
see
all
sort
of
other
character
from
the
golf
course
,
with
some
shrub
grow
over
they
.
so
,
in
1
,
000
year
this
stupid
little
golf
course
have
stand
the
test
of
time
,
with
only
a
few
weed
grow
over
it
?
anyway
,
some
of
the
human
be
capture
by
the
psychlo
lead
by
terl
-lrb-
john
travolta
-rrb-
a
smarmy
and
opportunistic
alien
planning
on
steal
a
recently
discover
gold
deposit
.
the
caveman
-lrb-
lead
by
barry
pepper
-rrb-
be
force
to
do
they
bidding
or
whatever
,
but
eventually
they
gain
the
upper
hand
and
reclaim
the
planet
,
or
something
.
so
these
caveman
be
able
to
do
what
earth
fail
to
do
1
,
000
year
earlier
?
and
,
we
be
suppose
to
believe
that
earth
be
conquer
in
nine
minute
by
a
group
of
buffoonish
alien
who
can
not
even
handle
a
few
caveman
?
one
of
the
way
the
human
reclaim
the
planet
be
by
take
control
of
abandon
air
force
jet
and
use
they
to
fight
the
psychlo
.
so
jet
leave
unattended
for
1
,
000
year
be
still
able
to
fly
?
please
,
if
i
leave
my
car
unattended
for
two
week
i
have
to
replace
every
fluid
and
hose
under
the
hood
.
why
do
the
psychlo
leave
jet
around
anyway
?
should
not
they
have
destroy
military
installation
during
they
massive
nine
minute
campaign
against
we
?
the
psychlo
refer
to
human
as
''
man
animal
''
but
yet
dog
be
still
''
dog
''
.
why
be
not
they
''
dog
animal
''
?
the
psychlo
be
after
mine
earth
's
precious
resource
,
but
for
1
,
000
year
be
unaware
of
fort
knox
?
why
do
i
even
care
at
this
point
?
i
be
a
fan
of
travolta
's
and
i
be
glad
to
see
he
be
back
on
the
a-list
in
hollywood
-lrb-
despite
the
fact
that
he
occasionally
put
out
crowd
please
dreck
like
michael
and
phenomenon
-rrb-
.
but
how
do
he
possibly
think
this
be
a
good
movie
?
and
how
do
he
think
he
be
give
a
good
performance
here
?
he
be
more
than
capable
of
make
a
menacing
villain
-lrb-
see
broken
arrow
and
face\/off
-rrb-
but
whenever
he
character
come
on
screen
i
could
not
hold
back
my
laughter
.
now
despite
the
different
facial
feature
member
of
this
alien
race
seem
to
have
,
travolta
just
look
like
travolta
.
all
of
the
other
alien
have
weird
forehead
or
other
pointy
bone
on
they
face
,
but
travolta
just
have
a
goatee
.
also
,
travolta
's
act
with
a
sort
of
phony
upper-class
snooty
accent
and
constantly
whine
about
bureaucratic
nonsense
back
on
he
home
world
.
ooooo
,
scary
villain
.
as
a
producer
he
should
know
better
and
as
a
actor
he
should
definitely
know
better
.
you
can
make
a
dumb
but
good
sci-fus
film
-lrb-
i
love
independence
day
for
example
-rrb-
,
but
there
be
absolutely
nothing
entertaining
about
battlefield
earth
.
i
do
everything
i
possibly
could
to
stay
awake
during
the
screening
...
i
clean
my
glass
,
walk
around
the
theater
,
make
a
grocery
list
,
choose
my
lottery
number
for
the
week
,
replay
super
bowl
xxv
in
my
head
-lrb-
with
commercial
-rrb-
...
and
still
be
compel
to
scrutinize
the
inside
of
my
eyelid
.
by
the
time
we
actually
reach
the
year
3000
,
people
should
still
be
avoid
this
film
.
folk
,
save
you
cash
.
.
do
not
go
see
it
,
do
not
rent
it
,
and
do
not
buy
it
.
you
would
be
more
entertain
by
take
the
money
you
would
use
for
this
movie
and
just
throw
it
into
the
wind
,
watch
it
sail
away
-lrb-
hell
,
send
it
to
we
here
at
the
jacksonville
film
journal
...
we
'll
entertain
you
plenty
with
that
kind
of
money
-rrb-
.
unless
of
course
you
be
just
captivate
by
countless
slow
motion
shot
of
barry
pepper
run
,
which
be
just
about
all
you
'll
come
away
with
from
this
movie
.
that
,
and
a
headache
.
-lrb-
editor
's
note
:
for
some
reason
though
,
the
day
after
my
screening
i
convert
to
scientology
.
i
be
not
sure
why
...
something
just
make
I
feel
compel
make
the
choice
.
