we
could
paraphrase
michelle
pfieffer
's
character
in
dangerous
mind
and
say
that
beyond
rangoon
start
with
a
''
a
.
''
that
be
fair
enough
.
all
movie
,
like
all
school
child
,
should
be
give
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
.
the
chance
to
succeed
.
after
all
,
we
like
to
think
that
the
right
combination
of
talent
and
effort
can
do
wonder
.
mountain
can
be
move
,
and
good
movie
can
be
make
.
yeah
right
.
child
fail
,
as
do
film
.
as
do
director
john
boorman
's
latest
.
the
success
of
beyond
rangoon
hinge
on
the
believability
of
patricium
arquette
-lrb-
ed
wood
,
true
romance
-rrb-
as
the
busty
westerner-in-peril
wander
about
1988
burma
without
a
passport
.
though
we
can
stomach
the
mild
plot
contrivance
that
get
she
there
,
it
be
a
tougher
task
to
overlook
the
actress
.
she
be
a
lightweight
.
as
the
first
scene
-lrb-
with
narration
!
-rrb-
demonstrate
,
she
do
not
have
\*
nearly
\*
enough
range
for
the
emotion
that
she
character
--
a
mother
flee
the
memory
of
a
murder
husband
and
son
--
be
suppose
to
show
.
she
may
give
a
stronger
performance
than
,
say
,
keanu
reeve
in
a
walk
in
the
cloud
,
by
not
by
much
.
beyond
rangoon
be
a
very
physically
appealing
film
,
thanks
to
the
practice
craftsmanship
of
john
boorman
-lrb-
deliverance
,
excalibur
,
hope
and
glory
-rrb-
.
he
keep
the
narrative
moving
,
no
matter
how
muddy
the
story
--
or
the
heroine
--
get
.
why
he
choose
arquette
remain
a
mystery
,
though
.
maybe
he
be
think
that
the
dramatic
weight
of
the
story
would
overcome
any
casting
deficiency
.
but
even
after
a
hour
of
half-stated
political
statement
and
murky
mass
killing
,
we
\*
still
\*
do
not
know
enough
of
what
be
happen
in
this
country
to
feel
distressed
for
the
character
or
they
situation
.
empty
exoticism
.
the
technical
credit
in
beyond
rangoon
be
a
curious
mix
,
combine
lush
jungle
photography
with
bad
blue-screen
work
.
also
odd
be
the
obvious
dubbing
.
do
to
make
some
of
the
foreign
character
sound
less
foreign
?
and
,
be
it
my
mistake
,
or
do
the
same
extra
keep
reappear
as
different
soldier
?
?
