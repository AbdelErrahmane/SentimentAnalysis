it
seem
that
i
have
stop
enjoy
movie
that
should
be
fun
to
watch
.
take
payback
,
for
example
,
a
movie
that
most
people
seem
to
like
.
however
,
it
be
horrible
schlock
,
straight
out
of
hollywood
's
vast
talent
for
suck
creativity
out
of
movie
.
it
be
write
and
direct
by
a
guy
who
should
have
do
better
;
however
,
maybe
he
do
do
better
,
after
all
,
30
percent
of
the
movie
be
not
he
own
.
mel
gibson
,
that
hollywood
zombie
,
decide
he
do
not
like
the
end
and
have
another
director
reshoot
it
.
what
a
crock
.
if
you
sign
on
to
do
a
movie
,
then
do
it
the
way
the
script
call
for
.
why
film
a
movie
and
then
look
at
it
later
and
say
,
-
no
,
i
change
my
mind
,
i
do
not
like
the
end
.
you
be
fire
.
let
's
get
someone
else
to
do
it
.
-
i
suppose
honor
be
dead
in
hollywood
.
the
end
of
the
film
be
,
of
course
,
hollywoodized
.
which
be
to
say
that
it
be
happy
and
the
guy
you
root
for
beat
impossible
odds
to
win
he
prize
.
in
this
case
,
as
be
most
victory
in
hollywood
movie
,
gibson
's
prize
be
a
blond
and
money
.
i
miss
originality
in
film
,
i
really
do
.
i
think
audience
be
so
starve
for
it
that
they
'll
flop
down
a
lot
of
money
in
hope
that
a
movie
will
be
original
.
payback
's
tagline
-
get
ready
to
root
for
the
bad
guy
-
promise
a
original
idea
,
but
it
be
far
from
the
truth
.
while
gibson
's
character
certainly
break
the
law
,
he
be
a
character
that
have
honor
-lrb-
odd
that
gibson
himself
seem
to
have
very
little
of
it
-rrb-
,
would
not
kill
in
front
of
child
and
protect
he
blond
woman
.
there
be
nothing
bad
about
he
-
he
be
a
hollywood
character
,
a
person
who
could
never
exist
in
real
life
.
and
gibson
know
it
-
he
spend
he
time
try
to
act
like
a
''
bad
guy
''
,
and
instead
come
off
as
pretentious
and
arrogant
.
the
story
involve
gibson
be
double-cross
by
he
partner
-lrb-
who
be
a
real
bad
guy
,
which
make
I
wish
that
we
could
root
for
he
-rrb-
over
$
70
,
000
.
gibson
recover
from
multiple
gunshot
,
be
piss
-lrb-
naturally
-rrb-
,
and
will
do
whatever
it
take
to
get
the
exact
amount
of
money
back
-
no
more
,
no
less
.
he
make
a
point
of
it
that
it
be
strictly
70
grand
.
a
real
bad
guy
would
have
make
he
ex-partner
pay
25
%
interest
.
this
idea
be
completely
stretch
out
.
gibson
end
up
go
after
he
partner
and
the
chicago
mafia
that
he
partner
be
affiliate
with
.
what
i
do
not
understand
-
this
be
the
chicago
mafia
.
$
70
,
000
be
like
spare
change
to
they
.
they
would
probably
just
pay
the
guy
rather
than
go
through
the
trouble
of
deal
with
he
.
i
think
they
would
respect
a
guy
go
through
this
much
trouble
for
a
simple
$
70
,
000
.
maybe
i
be
be
too
hard
on
the
movie
.
perhaps
the
filmmaker
be
just
try
to
make
a
simple
popcorn
movie
.
i
read
roger
ebert
's
review
and
he
like
gibson
in
the
role
because
he
be
a
comic
at
heart
play
a
bad
guy
.
that
be
why
we
be
allow
to
root
for
he
.
and
it
be
true
-
gibson
walk
the
movie
as
if
he
be
smile
at
a
joke
he
just
hear
.
but
he
be
wrong
here
.
i
want
a
lee
marvin
or
old-time
clint
eastwood
or
somebody
who
be
not
a
comic
,
just
a
ass
kicker
.
as
a
side
note
,
i
have
just
check
the
internet
movie
database
and
discover
that
i
be
the
38th
person
to
post
a
newsgroup
review
of
payback
.
after
this
many
review
,
why
would
anyone
want
to
read
this
?
really
,
i
do
not
care
.
i
be
just
try
to
gain
membership
into
the
on-line
film
critic
society
by
post
as
many
review
as
i
can
.
