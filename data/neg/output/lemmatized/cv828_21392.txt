that
be
,
unless
you
be
one
of
those
people
who
have
see
the
preview
a
thousand
time
on
tv
or
in
the
theater
.
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
now
:
they
give
the
entire
movie
away
.
why
someone
would
want
to
base
a
entire
movie
on
one
premise
and
then
give
that
crucial
detail
away
in
the
trailer
be
beyond
I
.
however
,
if
they
\*
have
not
\*
give
it
away
,
the
film
would
have
still
be
suprisingly
devoid
of
suspense
give
its
subject
matter
.
obviously
,
the
producer
think
they
could
remake
''
the
deep
end
of
the
ocean
,
''
throw
in
tommy
lee
jone
and
a
couple
of
cliche
and
call
it
a
action
drama
.
''
double
jeopardy
''
offer
solid
act
from
ashley
judd
and
tommy
lee
jone
,
who
get
first
billing
even
though
he
do
not
see
to
be
on
screen
half
as
much
as
judd
do
.
it
also
offer
some
genuinely
funny
,
clever
,
or
full-of-tension
moment
-lrb-
my
favorite
:
judd
wake
up
in
the
coffin
-rrb-
,
but
none
of
that
can
salvage
the
film
from
its
insanely
predictable
plot
.
half
the
time
i
be
wonder
whether
i
be
watch
one
of
those
overhyped
tv
miniseries
,
which
always
turn
out
to
be
less
exciting
than
advertise
.
judge
by
the
beginning
,
end
,
and
a
huge
chunk
of
the
middle
,
i
might
have
be
watch
a
special
hallmark
presentation
too
.
the
movie
's
stretch
for
a
almost
two
hour
long
film
with
only
30
minute
worth
of
material
.
implausible
material
,
no
less
.
loose
interpretation
of
one
of
the
amendment
aside
,
too
many
time
in
the
movie
i
think
,
''
that
be
\*
not
\*
possible
\*
.
''
that
kind
of
stuff
be
excusable
in
popcorn
movie
,
but
not
one
like
''
double
jeopardy
''
that
try
to
pass
itself
off
as
serious
drama
.
everything
seem
drag
out
,
overplay
.
when
they
should
have
keep
we
in
the
dark
,
they
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
too
early
.
