sylvester
stallone
have
make
some
crap
film
in
he
lifetime
,
but
this
have
get
to
be
one
of
the
worst
.
a
totally
dull
story
that
think
it
can
use
various
explosion
to
make
it
interesting
,
''
the
specialist
''
be
about
as
exciting
as
a
episode
of
''
dragnet
,
''
and
about
as
well
act
.
even
some
attempt
at
film
noir
mood
be
destroy
by
a
sappy
script
,
stupid
and
unlikable
character
,
and
just
plain
nothingness
.
who
know
a
big
explosion
could
be
so
boring
and
anti-climactic
?
unless
you
see
''
blow
away
''
...
''
the
specliast
''
of
the
title
be
none
other
than
action
star
sylvester
stallone
-lrb-
in
comeback
#
19
,
i
think
-rrb-
,
who
play
a
quiet
,
hermit-like
bomber
who
be
once
a
bomb
expert
with
the
army
or
something
,
but
who
suffer
a
change
of
heart
when
he
and
he
assistant
-lrb-
jame
wood
,
who
show
we
exactly
what
over-the-top
be
,
other
than
another
bad
sly
film
-rrb-
accidentally
kill
some
innocent
people
during
a
job
.
he
credo
be
kill
bad
people
,
not
innocent
.
and
that
be
why
he
make
big
bomb
.
so
anyway
,
into
he
life
step
the
seductive
sharon
stone
,
who
be
basically
the
girlfriend\/moll
of
the
stupid
son
-lrb-
eric
robert
-rrb-
of
a
cuban\/miami
kingpin
-lrb-
rod
steiger
,
in
a
indecipherable
accent
,
which
be
sometimes
cuban
,
sometimes
brando
,
sometimes
scottish
,
etc
-rrb-
.
turn
out
sharon
be
actually
use
she
boyfriend
so
she
can
kill
he
,
since
he
kill
she
parent
when
she
be
young
.
so
she
call
sly
,
leave
message
with
he
,
send
he
e-mail
,
etc
,
about
plant
a
bomb
to
kill
robert
,
which
sly
listen
to
obsessively
,
and
while
he
work
out
naked
.
yea
.
also
into
he
life
,
though
again
,
come
wood
,
who
have
be
tip
off
by
stone
to
catch
sly
.
use
the
cop
,
he
try
to
set
up
trap
,
none
which
really
work
,
so
when
sly
call
he
,
he
go
ballisitic
on
he
ass
over
the
phone
,
get
so
work
up
by
say
he
must-be-improvised
speech
that
he
seem
to
pop
the
vein
in
he
head
wide
open
.
these
be
the
most
exciting
scene
in
the
film
,
and
wood
become
the
only
ounce
of
entertainment
in
the
film
.
the
film
try
to
offer
we
a
moody
film
noir
,
except
with
explosion
,
but
come
up
completely
snake-eye
.
it
be
just
a
pretend
film
noir
,
make
it
a
big
waste
of
time
.
and
for
action
buff
,
the
action
scene
be
pretty
lame
,
with
some
really
unrealistic-looking
special
effect
-lrb-
a
penthouse
be
blow
off
of
a
hotel
look
like
a
piece
of
cardboard
fall
into
a
tub
-rrb-
.
then
there
be
the
much-discussed
sex
scene
between
sly
and
stone
,
which
be
about
as
mispair
a
couple
as
rachel
and
ross
on
''
friend
.
''
they
sex
scene
be
more
nauseating
then
sexy
,
because
it
show
we
more
of
sly
than
stone
.
now
let
's
guess
who
we
would
rather
see
naked
,
okay
?
stone
's
small
but
perky
breast
,
which
we
have
see
more
time
than
harvey
keitel
's
dick
,
or
stallone
's
veiny
ass
,
which
be
not
usually
show
for
a
very
good
reason
?
i
know
i
can
not
really
judge
it
as
a
flaw
of
the
film
,
but
come
on
.
the
worst
flaw
of
the
film
be
this
:
it
be
boring
.
i
mean
,
i
be
on
caffeine
when
watch
it
,
but
my
friend
fall
asleep
only
to
be
wake
up
by
jame
wood
rant
.
but
a
good
movie
do
not
jame
wood
go
nut
make
.
if
you
be
in
for
some
fun
action
,
rent
sly
's
earlier
''
demolition
man
,
''
which
suck
too
,
but
in
a
much
more
entertaining
fashion
.
skip
this
dull
film
,
unless
you
want
to
see
wood
,
or
make
fun
of
steiger
's
accent
,
or
see
stone
's
breast
again
.
