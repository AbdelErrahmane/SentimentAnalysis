''
battlefield
earth
''
be
the
best
comedy
of
the
year
.
it
have
to
be
.
the
other
prospect
be
just
too
horrifying
to
consider
.
bad
movie
syndrome
strike
I
again
,
so
after
witness
how
much
''
battlefield
earth
''
have
be
proclaim
a
train
wreck
in
both
critical
and
popular
circle
,
i
feel
the
masochistic
urge
to
see
the
disaster
first-hand
.
be
it
as
bad
as
advertise
?
oh
yes
,
very
much
so
.
the
plot
be
incomprehensible
.
the
acting
be
atrocious
.
the
special
effect
be
mediocre
.
the
action
be
dull
.
the
implausibility
be
legion
.
the
dialogue
be
cringe-inducing
.
the
whole
package
be
funny
when
it
want
to
be
serious
and
irritating
when
it
want
to
be
funny
.
i
do
not
even
want
to
continue
review
this
movie
;
i
would
like
to
purge
the
atrocity
from
my
mind
as
soon
as
possible
,
but
you
probably
want
to
read
my
thrashing
in
all
its
sarcastic
glory
,
so
here
it
be
:
the
premise
be
basically
a
rip-off
of
''
planet
of
the
ape
,
''
only
minus
the
ape
and
philosophical
discussion
,
and
plus
a
race
of
evil
alien
from
the
planet
psychlo
.
the
year
be
3000
,
the
psychlo
have
conquer
earth
,
and
the
human
population
have
be
enslave
.
only
a
handful
of
human
escape
to
radiation-rich
area
to
escape
the
alien
;
they
live
out
they
life
in
fear
.
one
man
,
johnny
goodboy
-lrb-
i
know
,
i
know
-rrb-
tyler
-lrb-
barry
pepper
-rrb-
,
venture
to
the
outworld
and
be
capture
by
the
psychlo
.
there
he
confront
the
psychlo
head
of
security
:
a
big
,
ugly
,
klingon-looking
creature
call
terl
-lrb-
john
travolta
-rrb-
.
press
into
slavery
,
johnny
vow
to
lead
a
revolution
and
take
the
planet
back
.
meanwhile
,
terl
be
face
with
he
own
problem
:
he
have
recently
learn
that
he
be
stuck
living
on
earth
-lrb-
which
he
hate
-rrb-
for
the
rest
of
he
career
because
he
piss
off
he
boss
by
sleep
with
the
big
man
's
daughter
.
he
decide
to
give
johnny
knowledge
of
the
psychlo
language
and
technology
-lrb-
this
be
where
the
plot
get
ridiculous
.
.
.
-rrb-
so
the
''
man-animal
''
can
lead
a
mining
expedition
into
place
the
psychlo
can
not
go
.
terl
then
plan
to
keep
the
mine
gold
for
himself
.
of
course
,
he
plan
do
not
work
.
so
many
thing
wrong
with
this
movie
--
where
to
begin
?
how
about
with
travolta
,
whose
hollywood
clout
bring
about
this
,
the
cinematic
version
of
scientology
guru
l
.
ron
hubbard
's
sci-fi
novel
?
early
preview
for
''
battlefield
earth
,
''
with
constant
shot
of
a
makeup-laden
travolta
cackle
like
lex
luthor
,
have
I
-lrb-
and
several
audience
member
-rrb-
remark
,
''
what
the
hell
be
travolta
thinking
?
''
the
movie
do
nothing
to
stem
such
remark
.
all
that
ridiculous
cackling
he
do
in
the
trailer
be
in
full
force
here
:
terl
cackle
after
nearly
every
line
,
and
so
do
every
other
psychlo
.
of
course
,
this
make
every
scene
hilariously
overwrought
,
no
more
so
than
when
the
script
clumsily
stumble
into
political
commentary
.
the
psychlo
be
probably
suppose
to
be
some
kind
of
satire
of
corporate
america
,
but
ceo
generally
do
not
laugh
maniacally
after
deny
pay
raise
to
they
employee
.
-lrb-
''
you
be
go
to
be
promote
--
but
now
you
be
not
!
fwahahahahahahahaha
!
!
!
!
!
''
-rrb-
it
be
no
big
surprise
terl
lose
to
the
human
--
he
be
a
idiot
.
he
break
every
kind
of
supervillain
rule
in
the
book
.
he
underestimate
he
enemy
,
assume
he
'll
win
just
because
he
be
smarter
.
-lrb-
he
use
the
word
''
leverage
''
like
some
sort
of
scientologist
mantra
.
-rrb-
not
content
to
go
the
jame
bond
villain
route
of
explain
he
plan
to
the
hero
,
he
hook
he
up
to
a
machine
that
give
he
knowledge
of
all
the
psychlo
'
language
and
technology
.
-lrb-
why
this
machine
be
even
around
in
the
first
place
be
beyond
I
.
-rrb-
he
then
appear
shocked
that
johnny
point
a
gun
at
he
.
no
wonder
this
guy
never
get
he
promotion
.
the
plot
inconsistency
be
too
numerous
to
mention
.
why
do
the
psychlo
build
a
earth
base
in
which
both
they
and
the
human
slave
must
wear
little
breathing
apparatus
to
survive
?
how
come
the
psychlo
be
waste
they
time
mine
for
gold
when
the
door
of
fort
knox
be
wide
open
?
how
in
the
world
do
all
those
fighter
jet
survive
sit
in
a
hangar
for
1
,
000
year
?
and
how
do
all
these
previously
brain-dead
caveman
learn
to
fly
they
so
quickly
?
there
be
a
whole
lot
more
to
scratch
one
's
head
about
in
''
battlefield
earth
.
''
bring
a
scorecard
to
track
the
plot
hole
.
director
roger
christian
shoot
''
battlefield
earth
''
in
the
most
distracting
way
possible
,
tilt
nearly
every
shot
sideways
for
no
discernible
reason
.
all
the
character
appear
to
be
stand
on
the
wall
,
and
it
be
awfully
difficult
to
watch
a
movie
when
you
must
tilt
you
head
just
to
watch
ordinary
passage
of
dialogue
.
the
action
sequence
be
atrociously
edit
,
every
one
turn
into
a
endless
slow-motion
parade
that
drain
all
potential
excitement
.
be
these
thing
really
so
hard
to
construct
?
my
respect
for
suppose
''
lightweight
''
action
director
have
grow
by
leap
and
bound
after
witness
in
''
battlefield
earth
''
how
badly
a
action
sequence
can
be
shoot
.
this
movie
be
a
absolute
headache
.
it
be
not
just
the
shot
selection
and
editing
;
the
movie
,
quite
frankly
,
make
no
sense
.
for
most
of
''
battlefield
earth
's
''
run
time
,
i
just
do
not
know
what
be
happen
.
it
do
not
have
anything
to
do
with
I
find
the
event
stupid
or
illogical
-lrb-
though
they
certainly
be
-rrb-
--
i
really
have
no
idea
what
the
hell
be
go
on
.
when
i
piece
the
plot
together
later
,
it
do
not
look
any
better
.
here
's
how
much
of
a
disaster
this
be
:
''
battlefield
earth
''
be
already
the
worst
movie
of
the
year
,
and
it
be
go
to
take
something
really
,
really
inept
to
top
it
.
the
only
thing
we
can
take
comfort
in
about
the
film
be
that
no
one
will
be
sucker
into
join
the
church
of
scientology
because
of
it
.
in
fact
,
i
would
think
that
hubbard
's
cult
would
want
to
distance
themselves
from
this
bomb
as
fast
as
possible
.
that
'll
teach
I
to
give
into
bad
movie
syndrome
again
.
