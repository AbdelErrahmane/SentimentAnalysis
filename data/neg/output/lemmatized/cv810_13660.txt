i
admit
it
.
i
think
arnold
schwarzenegger
have
a
knack
for
comedy
when
he
make
twin
and
true
lie
.
watch
he
in
jingle
all
the
way
,
i
wonder
why
anyone
ever
think
he
could
carry
such
a
lame
movie
target
at
susceptible
kid
.
it
be
one
thing
to
scare
the
crap
out
of
kid
with
the
pg-13
kindergarten
cop
,
but
parent
who
let
small
child
see
this
movie
will
have
to
explain
theme
of
violence
,
alcohol
consumption
,
burglary
,
racism
and
child
molestation
.
and
you
know
they
'll
burst
out
in
tear
when
arnold
punch
one
of
santa
's
elf
.
he
later
deck
a
reindeer
.
hey
,
man
,
why
do
not
you
just
kick
the
easter
bunny
in
the
nut
while
you
be
at
it
?
jingle
all
the
way
be
formulum
crap
that
follow
the
if
someone
fall
on
he
ass
,
it
must
be
funny
school
of
thought
.
arnold
,
sinbad
and
phil
hartman
crash
to
the
ground
more
time
in
this
movie
than
a
special
olympics
hockey
team
,
and
the
movie
dredge
up
more
cliche
and
less
believability
with
each
successive
scene
.
what
can
you
expect
from
a
movie
whose
entire
premise
be
that
two
parent
can
not
find
a
rare
toy
on
christmas
eve
,
and
will
do
anything
to
get
one
?
arnold
be
,
of
course
,
one
of
the
parent
,
a
crack
salesman
who
be
never
there
for
he
son
.
he
race
from
the
office
to
he
son
's
karate
game
,
only
to
find
out
he
miss
it
.
and
he
kid
distrust
he
because
he
be
never
around
.
-lrb-
gee
,
we
have
not
see
that
in
a
movie
before
.
-rrb-
arnold
the
absentee
father
become
convinced
that
the
only
way
to
buy
back
he
son
's
affection
be
to
get
he
a
turboman
doll
,
which
he
wife
-lrb-
rita
wilson
,
who
will
never
be
the
breadwinner
of
the
hank
household
choose
role
like
this
-rrb-
tell
he
to
get
week
ago
.
so
arnold
set
out
to
find
a
turboman
,
which
turn
out
to
be
more
rare
than
the
tickle
I
elmo
be
when
jingle
all
the
way
come
out
.
let
I
back
up
for
a
minute
here
--
arnold
's
kid
be
totally
obsess
with
this
turboman
character
,
which
be
unhealthy
beyond
belief
.
watch
the
show
,
eat
the
cereal
,
sleep
on
the
freakin
'
turboman
sheet
.
i
would
try
to
discourage
any
further
obsession
myself
,
lest
any
kid
see
this
movie
think
it
be
a
wonderful
thing
to
con
you
dad
into
race
out
to
buy
you
any
toy
you
want
.
but
nooooo
,
the
climax
of
jingle
all
the
way
have
arnold
dress
up
as
turboman
in
a
parade
,
exonerate
himself
of
all
wrongdoing
in
the
eye
of
wife
and
son
,
who
do
not
recognize
he
until
the
last
minute
.
this
be
a
sad
movie
all
the
way
through
,
but
it
only
get
worse
after
the
opening
scene
of
arnold
and
mailman
sinbad
stampede
through
a
store
,
race
off
to
the
mall
and
hook
up
with
a
santa
-lrb-
jim
belushus
-rrb-
who
run
a
bootleg
toy
factory
.
most
painful
to
watch
be
a
scene
at
a
radio
station
,
where
sinbad
hold
off
the
cop
with
a
letter
bomb
after
beat
up
the
deejay
-lrb-
a
embarrassed
martin
mull
-rrb-
who
say
he
be
give
away
a
turboman
doll
.
capitalism
have
produce
some
pretty
evil
thing
-lrb-
chium
pet
-rrb-
,
but
this
ode
to
excess
and
violent
consumerism
be
one
of
the
most
shameful
.
never
mind
the
subplot
with
perfect
neighbor
phil
hartman
try
to
seduce
wilson
while
arnold
be
off
shopping
-lrb-
''
you
cookie
be
incredible
''
-rrb-
,
it
be
the
main
plot
of
the
movie
that
send
the
message
that
it
be
okay
to
do
whatever
it
take
to
get
you
hand
on
what
you
want
.
maybe
that
be
what
christmas
be
like
at
the
schwarzenegger
house
,
but
not
at
mine
.
