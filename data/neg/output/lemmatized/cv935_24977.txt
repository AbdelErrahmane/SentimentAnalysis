's
house

martin
lawrence
in

fat
suit
and
a
dress
.
that
be
not
just
the
high-concept
premise
;
it
be
the
fully-realized
,
all-encompassing
plot
.
such
a
emphasis
be
not
unheard-of
in
the
world
of
hollywood
summer
entertainment

one
need
merely
look
back
to
last
summer
,
when
the
plot
of
big
daddy
be
adam
sandler
be
a
incompetent
surrogate
parent
.
the
trap
inherent
in
such
a
approach
be
that
the
high-concept
plot
idea
better
be
pretty
well-realized
,
or
rest
on
the
shoulder
of
a
extremely
talented
performer
,
because
you
can
bet
there
will
be
nothing
else
worth
a
second
of
you
time
--
not
a
developed
character
,
not
a
provocative
theme
,
not
a
witty
twist
.
you
will
get
90-plus
minute
of
martin
lawrence
in
a
fat
suit
and
a
dress
--
nothing
more
,
nothing
less
.
those
who
find
martin
lawrence
more
than
a
occasionally
amusing
screen
presence
may
have
a
shot
at

the
one-note
dud
that

the

there
be
just
as
strong
a
whiff
of
tootsie
in
the
main
character
's
attempt
to
use
he
alternate
identity
to
get
closer
to
a

.
unfortunately
,
big
momma
's
house
make
a
ridiculous
decision
neither
of
those
other
film
make
:
instead
of
have
the
protagonist
pose
as
a
completely
manufacture
character
unfamiliar
to
anyone
els
,
it
place
malcolm
in
the
position
of
play
a
friend
and
family
member
to
several
other
character
.
suspension
of
disbelief
in
big
momma
's
house
require
you
to
believe
every
other
person
in
the
film
be
blind
and\/or
stupid
,
since
no
one
notice
that
one
big
momma
look
or
sound
absolutely
nothing
like
the
other
.
of
course
,
laugh
trump
logic
every
time
,
and
big
momma
's
house
probably
still
would
have
work
in
spite
of
its
utter
disdain
for
common
sense
if
it
have
just
manage
to
be
funny
.
and
it
miss
its
best
possible
opportunity
for
some
great
farce
by
ignore
the
simple
fact
that
the
real
big
momma
be
set
up
as
a
foul-tempered
beast
,
while
malcolm
have
to
be
nurture
in
order
to
get
the
information
he
want
out
of
sherry
.
unfortunately
,
no
one
involve
appear
to
have
the
faintest
idea
how
to
deal
with
the
comic
gold
mine
involve
in
one
real
person
pretend
to
be
another
,
very
different
real
person
,
so
they
fall
back
on
a
endless
parade
of
sight
gag
:
malcolm
react
violently
to
big
momma
's
explosive
diarrhea
attack
;
malcolm-as-momma
schooling
a
pair
of
cocky
teens
in
basketball
;
malcolm
try
to
avoid
detection
as
various
prosthesis
give
way
at
inopportune
moment
;
malcolm
deliver
a
baby
because
big
momma
be
the
town
midwife
-lrb-
one
of
the
few
sequence
that
work
-rrb-
.
martin
lawrence
can
be
likeable
enough
at
time
,
but
there
be
no
reason
to
care
a
whit
about
he
bud
romance
with
sherry
because
malcolm
be
never
a
independently
significant
character
.
he
be
just
big
momma
without
the
makeup
on
.
i
will
not
waste
time
comment
on
how
ineptly
the
set-up
of
the
escape
convict
be
employ
,
since
it
be
clearly
a
waste
of
time
to
the
film-maker
.
there
be
a
few
token
scene
of
lester
loom
as
a
threatening
figure
,
but
he
be
ultimately
a
distraction
in
a
film
that
be
really
about
its
central
visual
incongruity
-lrb-
and
the
accompany
lascivious
glance
at
nium
long
's
posterior
-rrb-
.
i
be
never
prepare
to
underestimate
how
appealing
that
idea
may
be
to
other
people
--
several
million
of
they
apparently
find
adam
sandler
as
a
incompetent
surrogate
parent
appeal
--
but
i
know
that
when
a
film-maker
try
to
throw
a
concept
at
I
and
pretend
that
it
be
a
entire
film
,
i
duck
out
of
the
way
.
the
gross
implausibility
of
big
momma
's
house
might
have
be
tolerable
if
it
be
seasoned
with
more
big
,
cleverly-constructed
laugh
.
its
lack
of
big
laugh
might
have
be
tolerable
if
its
character
be
at
all
relevant
.
big
momma
's
house
be
ridiculous
_
and
_
not
funny
.
it
be
just
a
sad
exercise
in
the
jaded
presumption
that
any
scene
should
be
consider
wacky
and
hilarious
if
it
involve
martin
lawrence
in
a
fat
suit
and
a
dress
.
