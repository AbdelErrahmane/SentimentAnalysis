make
you
first
feature
film
be
not
easy
.
assemble
a
decent
,
if
not
,
strong
cast
,
as
writer\/director
robert
moresco
have
do
with
one
eyed
king
,
and
you
be
already
ahead
of
the
game
.
but
rehash
old
plot
line
,
tired
dialogue
,
and
standard
clich
?
s
,
and
a
well-intentioned
effort
such
as
this
one
could
jeopardize
you
chance
at
a
second
feature
film
.
how
many
more
movie
do
we
need
about
a
rough
neighborhood
full
of
lifelong
friend
hopelessly
turn
to
crime
or
worse
?
the
enormous
catalog
of
such
movie
might
dissuade
a
filmmaker
from
make
yet
another
,
but
here
we
have
it
.
again
.
five
irish
kid
in
nyc
's
hell
's
kitchen
make
a
overemotional
pact
over
some
steal
ring
on
a
anonymous
rooftop
.
with
teary
music
.
and
slow
motion
.
in
the
film
's
first
scene
.
the
kid
grow
up
to
be
fairly
worthless
adult
,
unable
or
unwilling
to
make
they
way
out
of
the
heat
of
the
kitchen
.
lead
the
clueless
pack
be
william
baldwin
as
a
good-hearted
guy
who
watch
out
for
he
buddy
and
be
in
tight
with
local
mob
head
armand
assante
.
i
would
like
to
say
that
he
character
get
involve
over
he
head
in
some
sort
of
blah
,
blah
,
blah
,
but
all
we
seem
to
get
be
little
taste
of
possible
plot
point
.
he
be
concerned
about
buddy
jason
gedrick
's
heroin
abuse
.
he
stick
up
for
jim
breuer
after
he
impregnate
baldwin
's
character
's
sister
.
he
look
into
who
might
be
push
the
most
moronic-looking
counterfeit
cash
ever
make
-lrb-
a
genuinely
funny
touch
-rrb-
.
but
none
of
this
ever
really
amount
to
anything
.
it
seem
that
moresco
's
greater
concern
be
to
provide
that
intangible
''
slice
of
life
''
,
that
flavor
of
the
neighborhood
that
everyone
's
be
try
to
evoke
since
scorsese
's
early
work
.
so
,
we
get
the
drunk
guy
,
hug
and
sing
together
at
the
local
bar
,
to
prove
to
we
that
they
really
love
each
other
.
-lrb-
do
people
actually
do
this
!
?
-rrb-
we
get
a
lot
of
tough
street
talk
--
usually
mumble
for
effect
--
and
a
whole
lot
of
the
f-word
,
whether
it
sound
like
it
fit
or
not
.
we
also
get
a
handful
of
good
actor
in
small
role
that
seem
to
lack
purpose
.
bruno
kirby
,
chazz
palminterus
,
you
know
,
guy
you
have
see
in
movie
just
like
this
one
before
.
assante
be
intelligent
casting
as
the
man
that
everyone
fear
,
and
baldwin
's
performance
be
adequate
,
but
most
of
the
rest
of
the
cast
jump
into
the
tough
guy
persona
so
thoroughly
that
it
be
almost
funny
.
moresco
,
a
theater
guy
and
sometimes
tv
writer
-lrb-
include
the
series
falcone
-rrb-
,
obviously
labor
over
this
one
as
anyone
might
a
first
child
,
but
the
content
be
probably
too
personal
.
as
a
result
,
the
movie
's
style
be
heavy-handed
,
in
need
of
a
considerable
amount
of
tone
down
.
nearly
every
time
a
action
by
the
grow
up
gang
recall
something
they
do
as
kid
,
moresco
remind
we
--
boy
do
he
remind
we
.
with
slow
dissolve
to
the
earlier
scene
,
run
in
slow
motion
,
complete
with
dialogue
from
the
present
,
just
in
case
we
do
not
comprehend
the
link
to
the
past
.
moresco
need
to
either
trust
he
audience
's
intelligence
,
or
have
more
faith
in
he
own
presentation
rather
than
beat
we
over
the
head
with
it
.
he
next
project
should
have
a
little
more
personal
distance
,
and
a
lot
more
subtlety
.
if
he
actually
get
that
chance
