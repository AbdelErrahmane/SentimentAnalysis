the
only
thing
that
you
can
say
about
junior
be
that
it
be
a
disappointment
,
and
a
big
one
at
that
.
junior
bring
together
arnold
schwarzenegger
and
danny
devito
with
director
ivan
reitman
.
these
be
the
same
man
that
bring
we
the
very
funny
twin
.
so
foolish
I
,
i
be
hope
for
something
that
would
at
least
come
close
to
the
level
of
quality
of
twin
.
so
much
for
hope
.
schwarzenegger
and
devito
play
two
scientist
-lrb-
doctor
hesse
and
arbogast
-rrb-
who
be
work
on
a
new
drug
that
will
reduce
the
possibility
of
miscarriage
in
pregnancy
.
unfortunately
,
due
to
circumstance
beyond
they
control
,
they
be
deny
permission
to
test
this
new
drug
on
human
,
and
subsequently
lose
they
funding
.
still
believe
that
they
drug
will
work
,
they
decide
to
test
it
anyway
,
on
hesse
.
so
,
dr
.
hesse
-lrb-
schwarzenegger
-rrb-
artificially
inseminate
himself
and
begin
take
the
drug
.
they
theory
be
that
if
the
drug
can
prevent
a
man
from
miscarry
,
surely
it
will
work
on
a
woman
.
do
the
thought
of
arnold
schwarzenegger
pregnant
sound
funny
or
humorous
to
you
?
well
,
it
must
have
to
the
producer
of
junior
.
admittedly
,
schwarzenegger
have
the
comedic
talent
to
pull
it
off
.
perhaps
if
it
have
be
do
differently
it
might
have
actually
be
funny
.
but
it
be
not
,
schwarzenegger
pregnant
be
goofy
at
best
.
the
sight
of
schwarzenegger
run
around
go
through
the
hormone
imbalance
that
come
with
pregnancy
,
and
the
accompany
emotional
swing
,
be
not
funny
.
schwarzenegger
come
very
close
to
embarrassing
himself
with
these
antic
.
i
keep
think
to
myself
,
with
the
time
arnold
waste
make
this
turkey
he
could
have
be
make
a
action
picture
.
better
yet
,
with
schwarzenegger
,
devito
and
reitman
all
in
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
,
why
do
not
they
make
a
sequel
to
twin
?
anything
would
have
be
better
than
this
mess
.
danny
devito
be
waste
in
this
movie
.
he
part
could
have
be
play
by
any
joker
they
pull
in
off
the
street
.
-lrb-
after
see
the
movie
,
if
i
be
devito
,
i
probably
would
have
wish
they
have
pull
someone
in
off
the
street
.
-rrb-
emma
thompson
be
waste
here
as
well
.
while
thompson
be
best
know
for
she
jane
austin
adaptation
,
she
be
also
a
fine
comedian
.
too
bad
she
do
not
get
to
use
any
of
that
talent
here
.
be
i
be
too
hard
on
this
film
?
i
do
not
think
so
.
schwarzenegger
and
devito
be
two
of
my
favorite
actor
in
film
today
,
and
ivan
reitman
be
one
of
the
more
talented
director
in
hollywood
.
with
a
support
cast
of
emma
thompson
and
frank
langellum
,
the
filmmaker
really
have
to
be
try
hard
to
make
a
bad
film
.
they
certainly
manage
here
.
maybe
it
be
well
intentioned
,
but
unfortunately
this
be
a
movie
that
never
should
have
be
make
.
if
you
be
tempt
to
see
this
film
,
do
yourself
a
favor
and
go
rent
twin
,
a
film
that
truly
take
advantage
of
arnold
schwarzenegger
and
danny
devito
's
comedic
talent
.
