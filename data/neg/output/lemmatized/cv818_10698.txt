i

they
of
the
annoyingly
infectious
bubblegum
pop
hook
and
cheesy
unifying
mantra
of

but
not
even
they
guilty

be
not
enough
to
carry
they
big

debut
,
a
junky
mess
which
would
be
more
aptly
name

than
spice

the

amusingly

i
must
give
the

credit
for

at

a

sing
the
lyric

much
of
the
material
be
not
even
funny
on

level

some
gag
be
just
plain

such
as
roger
moore
's

who
dispense
cryptic

metaphor-heavy
advice

the

the

as

i
think
there
be
one
insurmountable
problem
with
even

make

,
and
that
be
the

themselves

the
point
be
not
that

,
for
the

,
they
really

that

will
please
the

surely
will

what
