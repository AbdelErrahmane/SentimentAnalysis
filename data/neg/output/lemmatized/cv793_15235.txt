this
be
the
worst
movie
i
have
view
so
far
in
98
.
the
avenger
=
silly
=
man
dress
in
a
bowler
hat
+
woman
wear
tight
leather
-rrb-
evil
scientist
dress
in
teddy
bear
suit
+
greater
evil
,
sir
August
de
wynter
wear
kilt
.
the
question
be
what
could
have
go
wrong
with
a
potentially
great
idea
with
big
name
cast
?
the
same
question
be
probably
ask
of
last
year
's
stinker
batman
and
robin
.
i
feel
the
production
get
a
little
too
smug
,
the
script
a
little
to
smart
and
direction
be
somehow
lose
in
the
chaos
of
random
event
that
collide
together
to
form
a
movie
.
my
greatest
criticism
rest
on
the
fact
that
there
be
no
chemistry
between
emma
peel
and
john
steed
-lrb-
thurman
and
fienne
-rrb-
?
something
that
be
a
vital
element
of
the
60
's
tv
serial
of
the
same
name
.
the
dialogue
go
on
and
on
about
tea
and
other
finer
british
perk
,
but
do
not
allow
much
room
for
character
development
and
interaction
,
except
to
perhaps
grate
on
the
viewer
's
nerve
.
one
wonder
why
the
dynamic
pair
bother
kiss
in
the
end
except
for
pure
english
formality
.
connery
as
sir
August
,
do
not
fair
better
than
thurman
or
fienne
.
he
dialogue
be
as
erratic
as
stormy
weather
,
mostly
embarrassing
and
poor
quality
.
if
there
be
a
movie
you
would
prefer
never
to
see
,
i
believe
the
avenger
would
be
a
good
choice
.
for
one
thing
,
you
will
not
have
to
witness
a
product
that
be
far
inferior
to
the
three
high
profile
name
that
be
associate
with
the
title
.
i
can
not
understand
how
something
so
poorly
produce
could
have
be
release
,
but
i
put
it
down
to
one
of
those
freak
happening
in
nature
,
like
lightning
you
can
not
see
it
come
until
it
hit
you
.
