one
get
the
impression
that

fill

thing
do
turn
more
exciting
when

ask

instead
of
the
routine

expect

he
walk
into
a
barrage
of
bullet
from
the
gun
of
another
ex-cop

be
,
himself
,
full
of
bloody
hole
.
this
unsettling
event
give
the
former
detective
a
project
to
throw
himself
into
and
launch
a
investigation
that
revolve
around
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
catherine
's
first
husband
20
year
before
.
through
a
series
of
very
complex
and
convoluted
plot
device
that
involve
murder
;
blackmail
;
gun
;
mel
's
mexico
travel
partner
and
he
parole
officer
;
ross
's
former
cop
buddy
,
ex-lover
and
would-be
sidekick
,
the
tale
finally
end
up
exactly
where
everyone
expect
it
to
.
it
be
a
film
noir
tradition
that
the
story
twist
and
turn
down
side
road
for
a
unexpected
finale
,
but
here
the
journey
meander
towards
a
end
that
no
one
care
about
.
the
only
surprise
be
exactly
whose
face
fit
which
role
in
the
scenario
.
by
the
time
they
show
you
,
it
do
not
matter
.
the
storyline
get
goofier
and
goofier
exemplify
in
ross
's
relationship
with
rubin
-lrb-
giancarlo
esposito
-rrb-
,
a
partner
wannabe
.
these
scene
be
obviously
design
to
be
comic
relief
,
however
they
be
neither
.
rubin
and
ross
have
some
past
relationship
but
either
it
be
not
explain
or
i
do
not
care
enough
at
that
point
to
remember
.
a
run
joke
about
where
harry
be
supposedly
shoot
while
in
mexico
be
probably
mean
to
mirror
he
question
about
whether
he
be
still
able
to
perform
.
it
be
also
not
funny
,
do
not
connect
and
keep
on
show
up
long
after
it
have
run
its
course
.
on
the
positive
side
,
it
be
often
enjoyable
to
watch
the
seasoned
actor
on
the
screen
.
the
three
lead
all
have
well-deserved
academy
award
and
turn
in
accomplished
,
if
not
extraordinary
job
.
newman
be
a
grand
actor
,
but
do
not
seem
quite
suit
to
the
dark
film
style
.
he
be
a
bit
too
clean
and
understate
to
come
across
as
desperate
and
down
and
out
.
hackman
,
also
low-key
,
be
believable
but
lack
sparkle
.
sarandon
come
across
well
as
a
sultry
older
babe
although
she
be
one-dimensional
.
the
actor
do
what
they
can
with
lame
dialog
,
but
they
can
not
pull
the
film
out
of
the
hole
it
be
dig
for
itself
.
jame
garner
who
play
ross
's
old
buddy
ex-cop
raymond
hope
be
always
a
treat
,
but
even
he
half-heartedly
struggle
through
line
like
''
i
be
glad
they
do
not
shoot
you
pecker
off
.
''
the
best
part
of
the
film
be
the
look
at
old
friend
,
how
they
relationship
change
over
the
year
and
the
difficult
choice
they
must
make
.
the
genuinely
easy
and
casual
interaction
among
the
actor
hint
that
be
on
the
set
be
much
more
interesting
than
what
end
up
on
the
screen
the
film
do
not
run
very
long
before
the
audience
realize
that
it
be
hopeless
.
the
only
reason
for
watch
be
the
actor
.
it
remind
I
of
disaster
movie
such
as
''
tower
inferno
''
where
the
star
power
be
suppose
to
make
everyone
ignore
the
film
's
problem
.
in
a
better
world
,
there
would
have
be
second-rate
actor
in
this
second-rate
movie
and
the
one
here
would
have
be
save
for
something
better
.
of
course
,
we
do
not
live
in
that
better
world
,
but
you
could
make
yours
a
little
nicer
by
choose
a
different
movie
.
