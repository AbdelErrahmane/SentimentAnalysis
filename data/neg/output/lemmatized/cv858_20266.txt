the
haunting
,
a
film
so
confuse
that
it
forget
the
true
meaning
of
a
horror
film
:
to
scare
we
.
if
you
have
ever
see
a
movie
,
which
you
probably
have
consider
you
be
on
this
website
,
you
should
know
about
all
of
the
trivia
they
post
before
a
movie
.
they
have
thing
like
illustration
and
you
have
to
guess
the
movie
or
fact
about
the
film
.
but
,
the
one
i
always
like
be
the
&
quot
;
other
name
&
quot
;
joke
that
try
and
rename
a
particular
film
.
for
instance
,
the
one
playing
before
the
haunting
have
different
title
for
the
film
,
small
soldier
.
they
have
title
like
little
infantry
and
can
i
get
those
fatigue
in
a
smaller
size
?
well
,
after
see
the
haunting
,
i
have
a
few
particular
name
for
it
as
well
.
unfortunately
,
i
can
only
post
one
of
they
,
otherwise
,
i
would
be
get
some
pretty
angry
e-mail
from
overprotective
mother
.
that
title
would
be
the
confusing
.
ok
,
that
be
a
pretty
bad
title
,
but
it
fit
this
film
perfectly
.
it
basically
serve
up
no
purpose
,
and
combine
with
dry
dialogue
and
a
boring
and
confusing
plot
,
it
complete
the
formulum
for
a
cinematic
bomb
.
liam
neeson
once
again
get
wrap
up
in
a
film
without
any
depth
,
but
at
least
the
phantom
menace
be
exciting
and
have
some
depth
.
the
haunting
be
nothing
but
trash
,
but
unfortunately
,
will
still
make
a
boatload
of
money
.
before
i
rant
and
rave
about
how
bad
this
film
be
,
let
I
point
out
the
few
,
and
i
stress
the
word
few
,
bright
spot
in
this
film
.
first
,
the
house
be
great
-
look
.
it
look
beautiful
,
but
this
be
also
a
dark
spot
.
it
look
so
great
that
it
be
hard
to
be
frighten
by
it
.
this
be
something
that
rear
its
ugly
head
at
all
point
of
the
film
.
thing
look
so
great
,
that
you
be
look
on
in
awe
instead
of
be
scare
straight
.
haunt
house
film
have
to
contain
one
element
to
even
be
slightly
successful
and
that
be
be
eerie
.
the
hill
house
be
not
eerie
.
it
be
beautiful
,
but
not
the
least
bit
frightening
.
ever
hear
of
lili
taylor
?
before
this
film
i
do
not
,
but
i
be
glad
that
i
do
now
.
she
give
the
only
satisfactory
performance
in
the
film
.
despite
the
dry
dialogue
and
boring\/confusing
concept
,
she
manage
to
light
up
the
screen
every
time
she
appear
,
but
unfortunately
,
she
co-star
be
usually
follow
right
behind
.
owen
wilson
,
who
play
luke
,
be
the
only
other
cast
member
even
close
to
give
a
admirable
performance
,
other
then
taylor
.
he
be
basically
there
for
the
comic
relief
,
and
he
character
development
be
poor
in
all
other
area
.
all
of
the
character
be
desperately
underdeveloped
.
wilson
have
potential
as
luke
,
but
it
seem
they
just
need
he
to
add
a
few
laugh
.
liam
neeson
and
catherine
zeta-jone
suffer
from
the
dialogue
and
plot
and
should
not
have
be
in
this
film
.
they
character
must
suffer
from
wicked
mood
swing
because
in
each
scene
they
turn
from
ruthless
to
compassionate
to
scared
to
brave
and
whatnot
.
they
just
be
not
believable
and
this
be
the
final
nail
in
the
haunting
's
coffin
.
the
plot
be
terrible
.
the
opening
scene
of
the
film
be
very
important
,
but
the
director
make
it
too
obvious
by
get
close-up
of
all
the
thing
that
will
play
a
major
role
in
the
end
of
the
film
.
as
i
sit
through
the
film
,
i
keep
wonder
what
this
film
be
try
to
accomplish
.
nell
,
lili
taylor
's
character
,
go
from
the
hunt
to
the
savior
.
it
make
no
sense
and
the
director
give
the
audience
no
reasoning
for
the
ridiculous
change
that
take
place
in
the
film
.
he
force
the
viewer
to
make
various
assumption
and
do
not
give
any
in-depth
information
.
for
instance
,
the
beginning
of
the
film
give
we
a
sense
of
why
nell
be
get
involve
in
the
program
.
but
,
we
get
zilch
for
the
other
four
.
plus
,
two
of
they
get
wipe
out
in
the
first
ten
minute
.
and
the
worst
part
:
most
horror
film
have
killing
.
for
some
reason
,
they
kill
off
luke
at
the
end
of
the
film
.
no
reason
whatsoever
,
just
off
with
he
head
,
literally
.
overall
,
the
haunting
be
the
epitome
of
a
bad
movie
.
bad
plot
,
confuse
storyline
and
a
waste
of
good
talent
.
hopefully
,
liam
neeson
can
rebind
and
get
into
a
good
film
and
be
use
to
he
full
potential
.
hopefully
,
lili
taylor
will
be
recognize
for
do
such
a
great
job
in
such
a
bad
film
.
and
hopefully
,
other
horror
film
,
such
as
the
blair
witch
project
and
the
haunting
of
hill
house
,
will
not
be
as
bad
as
this
one
.
