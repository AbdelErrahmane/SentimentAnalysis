under
any
other
circumstance
,
i
would
not
be
discuss
the
ending
of
a
film
to
the
extent
that
i
will
in
this
particular
review
.
however
,
in
order
to
fully
explain
exactly
how
and
why
this
movie
be
so
awful
,
a
minute
dissection
of
the
end
be
necessary
.
even
though
i
will
not
reveal
the
detail
of
the
last
scene
,
do
proceed
at
you
own
risk
.
the
movie
open
-lrb-
quite
poorly
,
i
might
add
-rrb-
as
child
psychologist
malcolm
crowe
-lrb-
bruce
willi
,
look
like
he
be
drag
out
of
he
trailer
at
the
wee
hour
of
the
morning
to
shoot
each
scene
-rrb-
and
he
wife
be
intrude
upon
by
one
of
malcolm
's
past
patient
.
distraught
,
the
suicidal
man

a
cameo
by
new
kid
on
the
block

-rrb-
shoot
malcolm
and
then
turn
the
gun
on
himself
.
cut
to
the
''
next
fall
''
,
as
we
find
the
good
doctor
quietly
observe
he
latest
case
,
a
trouble
young
man
name
cole
-lrb-
haley
joel
osment
,
one
of
the
only
child
actor
in
a
while
i
do
not
want
to
bludgeon
over
the
head
with
a
blunt
instrument
-rrb-
.
after
about
45
minute
of
seemingly
unrelated
freak
occurrence
,
we
learn
that
cole
have
''
the
sixth
sense
''
,
the
gift
of
be
able
to
communicate
with
the
dead
.
and
this
,
as
they
say
,
be
where
the
healing
begin
.
the
sixth
sense
and
its
unexpected
popularity
be
found
upon
a
twist
end
that
i
know
go
into
the
film
-lrb-
one
of
roger
ebert
's
college
be
kind
enough
to
give
it
away
on
a
recent
segment
of
''
siskel
and
ebert
''
-rrb-
.
although
i
be
at
first
enraged
that
a
established
film
critic
could
so
callously
ruin
a
film
for
thousand
of
patron
,
i
soon
realize
that
this
turn
of
event
could
in
fact
have
be
a
blessing
in
disguise
;
i
have
always
be
a
sucker
for
surprise
ending
-lrb-
my
favorite
movie
be
the
usual
suspect
-rrb-
and
rarely
dislike
a
film
that
sport
one
.
here
,
since
i
know
the
major
plot
twist
that
be
come
at
the
film
's
conclusion
,
the
possibly
of
be
bamboozle
into
love
a
bad
movie
solely
because
of
its
end
-lrb-
something
i
have
fall
victim
to
in
the
past
-rrb-
be
eliminate
.
and
indeed
,
my
viewing
of
the
sixth
sense
do
prove
to
be
quite
a
enlighten
experiment
.
strip
of
the
element
of
surprise
,
the
film
be
put
to
the
task
of
show
what
it
really
have
,
instead
of
simply
hide
behind
a
shocking
conclusion
.
after
see
its
true
color
,
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sixth
sense
be
,
despite
what
the
many
champion
of
the
movie
may
say
,
void
of
any
real
power
.
it
be
a
neat
concept
,
but
not
one
that
justify
be
make
into
a
feature-length
movie
.
in
fact
,
the
sixth
sense
rely
so
strongly
on
its
finale
that
the
rest
of
the
film
develop
as
a
sort
of
prelude
to
the
supposedly
earth-shattering
revelation
that
be
yet
to
come
.
and
when
the
final
moment
do
come
,
it
be
a
huge
letdown
;
the
end
make
no
sense
at
all
.
it
stupefy
I
with
the
height
of
its
ineptitude
and
be
completely
idiotic
on
a
fundamental
and
very
rare
level
.
i
will
not
go
into
any
detail
,
but
suffice
to
say
that
,
as
far
as
i
can
tell
,
it
negate
to
rest
of
the
movie
to
such
a
extent
that
anyone
who
buy
it
even
for
a
second
must
be
suffer
from
a
very
acute
case
of
attention
deficit
disorder
.
now
,
in
all
fairness
,
i
can
not
say
for
sure
that
i
would
have
guess
the
ending
-lrb-
however
stupid
it
may
be
-rrb-
have
it
not
be
reveal
to
I
before
hand
.
however
,
i
feel
very
confident
that
i
,
as
well
as
anyone
who
have
see
a
few
''
twilight
zone
''
episode
,
would
have
see
it
come
a
mile
away
.
the
fact
that
movie-goer
nation
wide
be
surprise
by
the
end
still
have
I
stump
.
ironically
,
to
fully
appreciate
the
best
scene
-lrb-
that
of
cole
and
malcolm
attend
a
little
girl
's
funeral
-rrb-
,
the
viewer
be
require
to
be
aware
of
a
very
rare
psychological
disorder
call
munchausen
syndrome
by
proxy
.
i
would
not
have
even
know
about
this
mental
disease
if
i
have
not
,
by
pure
dumb
luck
,
catch
''
dateline
nbc
''
the
other
week
when
they
do
a
feature
story
on
it
.
despite
be
bless
with
some
really
amazing
cinematography
and
a
brauva
performance
from
osment
-lrb-
where
be
this
kid
when
cast
call
be
go
out
for
the
phantom
menace
?
-rrb-
,
in
the
end
,
the
sixth
sense
be
too
chalk-full
of
contradiction
and
just
be
not
plausible
enough
to
warrant
even
a
slight
recommendation
.
