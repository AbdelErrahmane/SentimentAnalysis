paul
verhoeven
,
the
dutch
auteur
who
drag
he
violent
,
sexually
aggressive
aesthetic
into
american
film
,
have
never
be
what
i
would
consider
a
thoughtful
director
-lrb-
though
some
of
he
film
,
notably
starship
trooper
,
have
be
laud
as
artistic
achievement
-rrb-
,
but
he
be
the
kind
of
hollywood
film
maker
who
be
manage
to
,
no
matter
what
the
budget
,
make
he
film
distinctive
and
even
sometimes
smuggle
stimulate
theme
into
the
lavish
high
concept
on
which
he
toil
.
starship
trooper
be
essentially
a
b-monster
movie
remake
of
he
enthralling
dutch
war
film
soldier
of
orange
-lrb-
a
great
film
that
be
nearly
impossible
to
find
on
video
,
yet
showgirl
be
everywhere
-rrb-
,
in
which
he
cast
a
troop
of
stunningly
attractive
mannequin
;
the
square
jawed
casper
van
dien
and
denise
richard
-lrb-
who
may
actually
be
45
%
silicone
-rrb-
,
in
what
feel
like
a
american
propaganda
picture
set
to
monotonous
scene
of
graphic
carnage
.
it
be
not
a
completely
successful
film
,
but
as
a
failure
it
be
certainly
a
interesting
-lrb-
and
mostly
entertaining
-rrb-
one
.
my
favorite
verhoeven
film
be
the
one
he
make
before
he
hit
we
shore
;
spetter
,
a
dark
near
pornographic
come
of
age
film
set
within
the
sub-culture
of
drag
racing
and
the
aforementioned
soldier
of
orange
-lrb-
have
not
yet
get
around
to
see
the
4th
man
or
turkish
delight
-rrb-
.
i
believe
he
best
hollywood
film
to
be
robocop
,
a
bleak
super-hero
satire
with
a
robotic
hero
that
be
as
touch
as
schwarzenegger
's
in
t2
.
that
movie
be
violent
but
not
in
the
overdo
cartoonish
manner
of
more
recent
verhoeven
pic
.
its
violence
seem
to
be
there
for
a
purpose
,
namely
to
create
a
atmosphere
of
unpredictable
dread
,
not
to
simply
titillate
a
attention
deprive
audience
.
there
be
a
jaw-dropping
scene
within
the
first
ten
minute
of
robocop
wherein
the
lead
villain
toy
with
a
cop
before
snuff
he
.
he
torture
the
officer
by
take
glee
in
he
victim
's
every
fearful
tic
.
it
be
a
startling
moment
of
barbaric
,
maddening
violence
that
effectively
set
the
tone
for
the
film
that
could
be
designate
as
splatter
punk-noir
.
in
hollow
man
kevin
bacon
brutally
slay
a
dog
because
it
just
will
not
shut
up
,
he
impale
a
co-worker
,
drown
another
and
so
on
.
but
why
?
he
character
be
introduce
as
a
smug
genius
,
the
kind
who
be
always
impeccably
dress
and
race
a
sport
car
while
generic
rock
tune
blare
from
he
stereo
for
the
world
to
hear
,
sort
of
like
a
scheming
uber
villain
from
dalla
or
melrose
place
,
though
once
the
character
become
invisible
,
this
film
have
he
pull
a
180
shift
into
a
psychotic
movie
monster
.
the
kind
who
just
will
not
die
.
hollow
man
's
protagonist
be
the
completely
bland
but
beautiful
scientist
linda
-lrb-
elizabeth
shue
,
act
as
if
she
be
rebecca
of
sunnybrook
farm
-rrb-
and
she
lover
,
a
hunk
of
beef
scientist
play
by
josh
brolin
who
be
saddle
with
the
film
's
worst
line
-lrb-
''
i
have
lose
cohesion
again
!
''
-rrb-
.
they
be
a
typical
aaron
spelling
couple
,
good-looking
but
as
vacant
as
george
w
.
bush
's
republican
national
convention
speech
-lrb-
i
.
e
.
bush
refer
to
clinton
;
''
?
?
?
so
much
promise
?
?
?
but
to
what
end
?
to
what
end
?
''
--
this
actually
get
applause
!
suddenly
warren
beatty
do
not
look
so
absurd
-rrb-
.
the
rest
of
the
film
's
character
be
all
well
past
thirty
,
though
act
like
annoying
high
school
party
animal
insulting
one
and
other
with
a
series
of
strained
one-liner
;
be
it
just
I
or
have
labor
insult
become
big
budget
hollywood
's
new
character
develop
technique
?
ahh
,
what
a
cynical
time
we
live
in
?
?
?
as
the
picture
open
we
meet
cain
-lrb-
kevin
bacon
-rrb-
,
a
egocentric
scientist
work
with
the
crew
of
aforementioned
irritating
scientist
on
a
top
secret
-lrb-
so
top
secret
the
government
have
only
provide
they
with
a
dilapidated
warehouse
in
which
to
perform
they
extensive
experimentation
's
-rrb-
project
with
the
goal
to
make
invisibility
a
possibility
-lrb-
for
what
purpose
be
never
hint
at
-rrb-
.
they
have
perform
several
experiment
on
animal
and
have
nearly
solve
the
quandary
cause
caine
,
in
a
twist
worthy
of
the
film
's
1950
's
late
show
origin
,
to
impulsively
experiment
on
himself
.
caine
neglect
to
let
the
pentagon
in
on
he
plan
and
somehow
get
two
of
he
co-worker
to
lie
for
he
so
the
rest
of
the
crew
will
think
the
pentagon
give
the
go
ahead
.
we
mad
scientist
be
turn
invisible
-lrb-
after
several
fx-heavy
complication
-rrb-
,
then
he
inexplicably
-lrb-
it
be
hint
that
the
process
of
invisibility
have
make
the
animal
into
more
savage
creature
,
but
this
be
never
explore
,
and
if
that
be
the
case
why
the
hell
would
anyone
be
stupid
enough
to
test
this
out
on
a
human
?
-rrb-
begin
rape
,
assault
and
murder
anyone
he
please
,
always
with
a
lame
wisecrack
ready
a
la
freddy
krueger
.
it
grow
abundantly
clear
with
each
new
release
that
it
be
verhoeven
's
film
that
have
become
hollow
.
like
the
rest
,
this
one
be
cold
,
heartless
,
and
full
of
contempt
for
humanity
,
but
in
addition
to
all
that
it
lack
any
trace
of
wit
,
insight
and
make
no
statement
other
than
''
audience
will
pay
for
anything
these
day
''
.
it
be
a
affront
to
anyone
look
for
something
stimulate
on
a
intellectual
level
,
or
even
those
hope
to
spend
a
Saturday
night
with
a
fun
,
thrill-a-minute
ride
.
verhoeven
have
instead
serve
up
a
utterly
routine
mad
slasher
flick
with
nobody
to
root
for
and
no
reason
to
care
.
the
preview
make
hollow
man
look
like
a
irresistible
flick
.
how
can
one
not
have
a
good
time
at
a
film
that
utilize
state
of
the
art
fx
to
illustrate
a
invisible
man
get
down
and
dirty
with
he
bad
self
?
a
couple
week
ago
,
after
see
the
trailer
,
a
bunch
of
friend
and
i
get
into
a
long
discussion
of
how
invisible
man
flick
never
go
so
far
as
to
have
the
invisible
individual
indulge
in
they
newfound
ability
.
hollow
man
look
like
the
first
film
to
do
so
and
whoa
,
in
a
serious
manner
to
boot
.
but
oh
yeah
,
it
be
direct
by
paul
verhoven
not
atom
egoyan
or
peter
greenway
.
verhoeven
deliver
the
sleazy
''
goods
''
,
but
not
in
a
watchable
or
thrillingly
disturbing
manner
,
here
it
just
feel
icky
and
uncomfortable
.
the
director
keep
he
camera
train
at
he
nubile
actress
,
caress
they
breast
with
he
lens
all
while
faux-psycho
music
strain
in
the
background
.
it
be
plainly
obvious
that
verhoeven
be
not
explore
voyeurism
-lrb-
like
in
the
classic
peeping
tom
-rrb-
but
exploit
it
and
not
even
do
that
very
well
.
it
be
funny
that
with
all
the
technology
$
90
million
can
get
you
verhoven
be
stick
at
try
to
figure
out
how
to
show
a
woman
's
naked
breast
manipulate
by
a
invisible
hand
.
most
vexing
be
that
the
invisibility
aspect
be
use
simply
as
gimmick
in
yet
another
slasher
movie
wherein
character
do
stupid
thing
just
so
the
villain
can
pop
up
for
more
attack
.
in
fact
it
be
largely
irrelevant
that
bacon
be
invisible
since
,
by
the
end
,
most
of
he
potential
victim
don
infer-red
glass
that
track
he
body
heat
.
as
in
every
mad
slasher
film
we
get
the
killer
pov
-lrb-
a
scene
where
he
spy
on
he
neighbor
while
she
undress
triggered
unpleasant
memory
of
slumber
party
massacre
-rrb-
,
and
lot
of
scene
where
people
be
unknowingly
stalk
.
the
film
only
provide
one
moment
that
i
find
genuinely
creepy
.
it
happen
when
a
lab
assistant
-lrb-
kim
dickens
,
who
look
like
she
step
out
of
playboy
-rrb-
in
the
middle
of
a
chit
chat
with
a
invisible
bacon
,
suddenly
pause
.
''
be
you
look
at
I
?
''
,
she
query
,
obviously
haunt
.
it
be
a
little
moment
in
a
big
film
with
nothing
to
offer
but
grind
break
special
effect
set
to
a
plot
that
should
have
run
its
course
by
1982
-lrb-
the
apex
of
the
mad
slasher
craze
-rrb-
.
those
special
effect
be
so
stunning
they
alone
keep
this
from
be
as
bad
as
urban
legend
or
i
still
know
what
you
do
last
summer
.
and
they
be
the
only
reason
to
check
out
hollow
man
,
preferably
as
a
mid-week
bargain
rental
.
you
have
be
warn
.
but
you
probably
will
not
listen
,
will
you
?
ti
'
a
pity
?
?
?
