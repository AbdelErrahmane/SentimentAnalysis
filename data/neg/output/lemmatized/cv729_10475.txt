as
forgetful
as
some
people
may
be
it
be
doubtful
that
anyone
could
forget
they
wedding
,
especially
three
time
.
but
,
alas
professor
brainard
somehow
manage
to
accomplish
this
feat
twice
before
the
momentous
night
that
he
actually
create
flubber
.
it
be
amazing
that
he
be
able
to
remember
any
of
the
process
he
use
to
make
anything
.
the
whole
point
here
be
how
could
a
man
be
so
blatantly
forgetful
.
this
be
not
absent
mind
this
be
almost
mindless
and
he
be
a
professor
.
well
,
this
be
the
case
for
about
the
first
half
of
the
movie
then
thing
begin
to
settle
into
what
might
truly
be
consider
absent
mind
.
along
the
way
to
become
absent
mind
from
absent
of
mind
the
professor
stumble
onto
flubber
.
thankfully
or
there
would
be
no
movie
or
any
amusement
for
the
audience
.
the
flubber
be
suppose
to
be
fly
rubber
,
but
it
seem
to
have
a
life
of
its
own
.
this
be
there
strictly
for
the
kid
.
the
property
of
the
flubber
provide
some
antic
for
the
audience
when
flubber
coated
golfball
and
bowling
ball
assail
two
would
be
thug
.
although
amusing
this
be
not
original
what
so
ever
and
bring
back
haunt
memory
of
home
alone
.
the
poor
professor
have
to
save
the
university
where
he
teach
at
,
get
he
fiancee
back
,
finally
stop
the
plot
of
a
evil
millionaire
,
and
do
all
this
in
the
funniest
way
possible
.
admittedly
there
be
funny
moment
but
the
movie
be
rather
shallow
and
do
not
compare
very
well
to
the
original
-lrb-
the
absent
mind
professor
-rrb-
.
the
whole
scene
with
the
basketball
game
be
just
atrocious
and
totally
unbelievable
.
the
basketball
player
,
stereotypically
unqualified
for
the
sport
,
somehow
manage
to
bounce
,
fly
and
dribble
they
way
back
to
be
close
to
win
?
this
just
sound
too
bad
to
be
true
,
the
least
that
could
have
be
do
be
keep
semus
close
to
the
original
movie
to
give
this
film
a
chance
.
as
for
innovation
and
new
idea
there
be
but
two
good
one
in
this
movie
.
give
life
to
the
flubber
,
which
be
so
poorly
execute
that
it
be
best
forget
,
and
prof
.
brainard
's
fly
robot
weebo
.
give
life
to
the
flubber
would
have
work
beautifully
if
it
be
not
for
scene
of
the
sort
where
you
have
the
flubber
dancing
around
on
table
and
book
for
no
real
reason
other
than
to
put
in
a
bit
of
music
and
extend
the
length
of
the
movie
.
the
life
of
the
flubber
have
brief
and
rather
whimsical
moment
where
it
might
have
be
use
well
,
but
it
be
not
and
in
the
end
might
have
do
the
movie
more
harm
than
good
.
now
,
weebo
be
a
totally
different
story
.
it
be
a
robot
that
prof
.
brainard
create
but
forget
how
and
give
something
of
a
life
too
.
this
be
a
really
original
idea
,
well
maybe
not
,
but
it
be
a
idea
that
be
well
execute
and
in
the
end
make
the
poor
robot
the
most
developed
and
real
character
in
the
movie
.
yes
folk
the
little
yellow
robot
have
more
emotion
and
character
than
the
character
.
the
film
lack
the
emotional
punch
to
pull
the
audience
in
at
all
.
the
act
by
robin
william
-lrb-
prof
.
brainard
-rrb-
seem
to
be
half
hearted
for
most
of
the
movie
and
in
many
case
quite
force
.
most
of
the
act
in
the
movie
be
so
convincing
as
to
fool
only
the
part
of
the
audience
that
have
not
quite
yet
reach
the
age
to
12
.
people
when
stand
up
at
the
altar
,
do
not
usually
give
third
chance
.
or
for
that
matter
talk
to
the
fiancee
afterwards
,
but
what
can
be
expect
this
be
a
child
's
movie
.
flubber
,
as
a
movie
do
little
original
and
be
nothing
special
in
any
respect
.
with
the
best
character
in
the
movie
be
something
of
a
prop
i
doubt
that
many
people
will
find
it
all
that
great
.
it
do
have
its
amusing
moment
and
it
be
a
good
story
in
the
end
,
but
it
do
not
wash
up
to
the
original
.
kid
should
find
this
movie
amusing
and
fun
and
they
'll
probably
enjoy
the
whole
movie
.
as
a
movie
it
be
just
a
kid
movie
and
not
the
best
of
one
at
that
.
