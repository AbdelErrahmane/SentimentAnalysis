best
remember
as
the
recently

who
always
start
the

norm
macdonald
,
at
time
,
could
elicit
some
laughter
by
blurt
out
semi-offensive
phrase
in
he
raspy
voice
,
coat
with
a
condescending
attitude
.
he
shtick
be
mark
by
crassness
.
in
this
movie
,
for
example
,
when
he
girlfriend
say
that
she
be
kick
he
out
because
he
be
be
fire
from
14
different
job
over
the
last
3
month
,
he
try
to
calm
the
situation
by
say
,
''
maybe
you
'll
feel
better
after
we
have
some
dirty
sex

this
kind
of
humor
can
only
go
so
far
,
but
certainly
can
not
go
the
distance
in
a
full-length
feature

''
dirty
work
''
,
be
nothing
more
than
a
sophomoric
comedy
about
two
best
friend
who
grow
up
only
physically
.
emotionally
,
they
have
never
outgrow
they
pubescent
year
,
which
be
somewhat
amusingly
explore
in
a
begin
flashback
.
although
have
no
apparent
real
world
skill
,
the
one
thing
that
these
two
have
always
be
adept
at
be
get
back
at
people
.
if
the
meter
maid
be
unjust
in
give
you
a
ticket
,
then
dump
a

in
the
funniest
scene

possibly
the
only
funny
scene
-rrb-
of
the

they
take
advantage
of

another

what
