however
,
have
nothing
to
do
with
nuptial
specifics
or
even
how
the
movie
stack
up
,
but
rather
whether
or
not
the
duo
get
down
and
dirty
on
they
blood-soaked
honeymoon
.
the
answer
be
a
sick-and-twisted
yes
-
and
viewer
be
treat
to
a
shadowy
glimpse
of
some
hot-enough-to-melt-rubber

the

the
road
to

out
some
potential

the

along
the
way
,
we
murderous

go
through
post-marriage
motion
similar
to
any
give
pair
of
newlywed

bicker
,
argue
,

and
make
up

but
when
they
squabble
over

director
ronny
yu
keep
the
mayhem
flashy
and
stage
a
inventive
scene
or
two
,
but
not
even
visual
flair
can
make
up
for
the
fact
that
these
creepy
kewpy
be
neither
scary
nor
menacing
.
when
one
of
they
charge
,
it
be
nothing
a
good

punt
could
not
take

and
when

throw
in
some
silly
casualty
and
a
ridiculous
ending
-lrb-
will
''
son

''
be
next
?
-rrb-
and
this
be
a
bizarrely
bad
89-minute
at
the
movie
.
as
be
the
thing
to
do
in

-
''
scream
''
slasher
cinema
,
don
mancinus
's
screenplay
slather
on
the
in-joke
and
genre-parody
.
but
little
of
the
humor
succeed
,
prove
self-reference
can
be
completely
worthless
when
it
lack
bite
.
to
be
fair
,
though
,
most
of
''
bride
of
chucky
''
be
on
auto-pilot
,
so
it
be
not
quite
right
to
single
out
one
misfire
aspect
of
the
film
.
similarly
shaky
,
the
act
range
from
screech
camp
to
boring
bland
,
the
effect
be
not
that
special
and
the
story
be
one
big
groaner
.
here
's
hope
chucky
and
he
entire
clan
-
past
,
present
and
future
-
rest
in
peace
