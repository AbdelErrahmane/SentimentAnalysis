if
anything
,

should
be
take
as
a
warning
against
release
similarly-themed
film
relatively
close
to

another

of
the
four
supernatural
horror
flick
release
this

it
be
clearly
the
worst

have
its
moment

but
be
not
anything
i
would
lose
sleep
over
.
clearly
,
the
quality
of
the
horror
this
summer
have
slowly
be
drop
.
be
it
then
any
surprise
that
''
stigma
''
be
the
dullest
,
most
horribly

piece
of
mtv-influenced

have

a
hairdresser
from
pittsburgh
who
receive
a
rosary
as
a
gift
from
she
globe-trotting
mother
.
as
it
turn
out
,
the
rosary
belong
to
a
recently-deceased
brazilian
priest
.
the
priest
's
church
have
be
under
investigation
by
father
andrew
kiernan
-lrb-
gabriel
byrne
-rrb-
because
of
the
mysterious
appearance
of
a
bleeding
statue
.
father
kiernan
be
a
investigator
who
have
make
a
career
out
of
disprove
suppose
religious
sign
,
but
this
time
he
believe
there
be
something
to
the
bleeding
statue
.
he
investigation
be
soon
call
off
,
however
,
when
the
frankie
start
exhibit
sign
of
the
stigma
,
in
which
a
person
be
inflict
with
wound
like
that
of
jesus
christ
.
father
kiernan
be
initially
skeptical
of
frankie
'
s
story
,
consider
she
be
a
atheist
,
but
once
he
witness
the
stigma
attack
himself
,
he
dedicate
himself
to
find
out
what
be
go
on
.
he
eventually
begin
to
suspect
that
he
boss
,
cardinal
houseman
-lrb-
jonathan
pryce
-rrb-
,
be
conceal
something
that
could
bring
down
the
catholic
church
.
as
it
turn
out
,
the
dead
priest
have
be
work
on
the
translation
of
a
''
fifth
gospel
''
before
they
be
excommunicate
.
the
new
rupert
wainwright
music
video
.
.
.
i
mean
film
''
stigma
''
be
the
sort
of
film
that
start
off
ok
and
only
get
worse
.
indeed
,
it
would
have
be
good
if
it
be
a
music
video
,
because
it
be
only
interesting
for
about
five
minute
.
i
be
not
sure
what
wainwright
be
try
to
prove
with
he
endless
parade
of
slow-motion
,
double-exposure
,
and
extreme
close-up
-lrb-
whoaaaaaa
!
!
!
!
-rrb-
,
other
than
the
fact
that
he
have
the
most
swell
head
of
any
director
in
hollywood
and
,
yes
,
he
have
be
to
film
school
.
he
camera
trickery
be
interesting
for
a
little
while
,
but
eventually
,
it
become
headache-inducing
.
what
this
film
need
be
a
second
audio
track
to
be
play
over
the
dialogue
-lrb-
such
as
it
be
-rrb-
,
with
wainwright
scream
at
the
audience
,
''
see
?
look
at
what
i
can
do
!
i
be
a
ex-cellent
dir-ect-or
.
''
maybe
then
he
would
explain
why
he
decide
to
start
half
of
he
scene
with
slow-motion
shot
of
water
drip
in
reverse
,
or
why
he
include
random
superfluous
shot
as
that
of
a
egg
frying
-lrb-
ooh
,
scary
!
-rrb-
.
if
there
be
some
underlying
meaning
behind
all
this
camera
trickery
,
i
do
not
see
it
.
just
when
you
think
it
be
safe
to
get
involve
in
the
story
,
here
come
a
double-exposure
shot
of
two
patricium
arquette
collapse
into
bed
for
no
reason
whatsoever
.
arrrrrrrghhhh
.
.
.
then
again
,
the
superfluous
camera
trickery
would
not
bother
I
if
''
stigma
''
have
a
story
or
character
that
be
remotely
engaging
.
though
wainwright
's
vanity
certainly
do
not
help
,
he
do
seem
to
have
be
give
a
nearly
unworkable
script
.
where
be
plot
continuity
and
character
development
when
you
need
they
?
case
in
point
:
frankie
page
be
the
character
that
-lrb-
i
assume
-rrb-
we
be
suppose
to
identify
and
sympathize
with
,
but
we
be
not
give
any
back
story
on
she
character
,
or
any
reason
to
like
she
.
the
extent
of
she
character
development
seem
to
be
that
she
be
a
hard-working
hairdresser
-lrb-
who
can
somehow
afford
a
cavernous
apartment
on
the
top
floor
of
she
building
-rrb-
and
she
be
kind
of
cute
,
so
let
's
start
the
bleeding
!
the
fact
that
she
be
clearly
not
the
brightest
bulb
in
the
drawer
do
not
help
,
either

arquette

give

but
they

be
so
one-dimensional
that

scene
between
arquette
and
byrne
that
be
probably
suppose
to
be
sexually
charge
fall
almost
embarrassingly
flat
,
because
the
setup
of
the
romantic
subplot
be
so
clumsily
handle
that
it
almost
reach
the
point
of
become
laughable
.
even
though
frankie
page
's
life
be
fall
apart
before
she
very
eye
,
she
still
find
the
time
to
hit
on
a
priest
who
wander
in
to
she
hair
salon
.
even
more
curiously
,
he
seem
to
be
interested
in
she
advance
.
father
andrew
's
religious
doubt
pop
up
so
suddenly
that
it
seem
more
silly
than
dramatic
.
as
for
pryce
,
he
may
as
well
wear
a
curl
mustache
and
cackle
,
''
i
'll
get
you
,
my
pretty

''
for
all
the
depth

trust
I
,
i
be
not
reveal
anything
by
tell
you
pryce
turn
out
to
be
a
villain
.
what
be
worse
,
after
be
face
with
dull
character
and
the
prospect
of
have
annoying
camera
trick
and
loud
music
jam
down
we
throat
,
we
now
have
to
contend
with
a
story
that
start
off
in
one
direction
,
veer
off
in
another
,
then
another
,
and
end
up
be
totally
incomprehensible
.
first
of
all
,
the
film
do
not
even
bother
to
explain
what
should
be
very
simple
plot
detail
.
how
do
frankie
get
the
stigma
merely
by
touch
a
rosary
?
how
come
a
atheist
like
she
be
choose
,
since
father
andrew
mention
that
only
very
devout
believer
have
ever
receive
stigma
?
actually
,
i
be
not
sure
what
frankie
be
posess
by
.
supposedly
,
stigma
occur
when
one
be
posess
by
the
holy
spirit
,
but
the
film
later
have
she
be
posess
by
the
dead
priest
,
and
later
by
some
evil
spirit
-lrb-
i
think
-rrb-
.
which
one
be
it
?
the
answer
to
this
question
,
of
course
,
be
very
simple
:
the
possess
entity
in
each
scene
be
determine
by
whichever
effect
and
flashy
camera
work
mr
.
wainwright
want
to
use
this
time
.
furthermore
,
the
end
be
a
ridiculously
neat
little
wrap-up
,
and
the
filmmaker
compound
this
problem
by
ultimately
turn
the
film
into
a
diatribe
against
the
catholic
church
.
if
you
do
any
research
at
all
about
the
gospel
of
st
.
thoma
,
you
'll
find
that
it
be
not
be
suppress
by
the
church
-lrb-
as
the
film
seem
to
claim
-rrb-
,
but
that
it
be
readily
available
at
you
local
library
.
there
be
nothing
the
catholic
need
to
worry
about
,
though
.
''
stigma
's
''
religion
be
so
off-base
that
it
can
not
be
confuse
for
anything
remotely
resemble
the
real
catholic
church
.
if
they
want
to
portray
catholic
priest
as
mobster
,
they
should
have
go
all-out
and
equip
they
with
sharkskin
suit
and
tommy
gun
,
which
would
have
be
far
more
interesting
.
i
be
not
catholic
;
in
fact
,
i
don
'
t
care
much
for
the
catholic
church
,
but
its
cartoonish
misrepresentation
in
this
film
should
not
be
consider
realistic
by
any
means
.
it
be
rare
to
see
a
film
that
fail
on
as
many
level
as
''
stigma
''
do
.
it
'
s
not
thought-provoking
,
though
it
would
like
to
be
,
and
it
be
definitely
not
scary
,
though
it
pretend
to
be
.
i
be
not
sure
why
they
try
to
pass
this
off
as
a
horror
film
,
because
there
be
absolutely
nothing
scary
about
the
story
.
maybe
it
be
a
attempt
to
cover
up
the
fact
that
none
of
the
scene
have
any
dramatic
weight
whatsoever
.
the
initial
shock
of
see
arquette
cover
with
blood
be
dull
by
the
fact
that
it
happen
over
,
and
over
,
and
over
.
like
so
many
film
of
the
mtv
generation
,
this
one
suffer
from
overkill
.
so
much
be
overdo
in
''
stigma
,
''
that
it
eventually
have
no
effect
on
the
audience
,
leave
we
to
pick
out
the
film
's
-lrb-
many
-rrb-
flaw
.
i
be
also
still
try
to
figure
out
why
the
quotation
they
take
from
the
gospel
of
st
.
thoma
be
so
earth-shattering
.
when
we
finally
hear
it
,
the
say
sound
like
something
every
five-year-old
learn
on
they
first
day
of
Sunday
school
,
which
mean
that
for
all
its
flash
,
the
whole
film
be
really
much
ado
about
nothing
.
the
dog
day
of
summer
usually
produce
one
monstrous
dog
,
and
''
stigma
''
be
it
.
