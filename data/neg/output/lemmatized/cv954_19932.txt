that
two
not-too-bright
teenage
girl
be
the
cause
of
the
uncover
of
the
nation
's
biggest
presidential
scandal
.
kirsten
dunst
and
michelle
william
star
betsy
and
arlene
,
who
while
try
to
deliver
a
fan
letter
from
arlene

watergate
hotel
room
,
accidentally
stumble
across
g
.
gordon
liddy
-lrb-
play
dead-on
by
harry
shearer
-rrb-
and
the
infamous
break-in
.
when
they
recognize
liddy
later
on
during
a
white
house
field
trip
,
they
be
usher
into
a
conference
room
,
question
as
to
what
they
know
,
and
leave
as
official
presidential
dog
walker
.
the
girl
manage
to
unwittingly
uncover
every
bit
of
the
watergate
scandal
while
perform
they
duty
,
but
have
no
clue
as
to
what
they
be
get
involve
with
.
when
they
discover
that
nixon
-lrb-
another
dead-on
performance
by
dan
hedaya
,
who
actually
favor
nixon
slightly
,
unlike
anthony
hopkin
-rrb-
have
be
abusive
to
checkers
,
the
presidential
dog
,
thanks
to
the
conversation
that
he
always
record
,
they
quit
and
become
disillusioned
.
during
a
prank
phone
call
the
girl
make
to
woodward
and
bernstein
,
event
be
set
into
motion
that
eventually
lead
to
the
president
's
resignation
.
this
film
start
off
promisingly
with
a
aged
woodward
and
bernstein
argue
with
each
other
on
a
obvious
larry
king-type
talk
show
-lrb-
feature
a
cameo
by
french
stewart
-rrb-
about
reveal
the
identity
of
''
deep
throat
''
.
from
there
,
we
be
subject
to
bodily
function
humor
and
just
about
every
bad
''
dick
''
joke
one
can
derive
from
this
type
of
suppose
comedy
.
at
one
point
,
the
girl
be
have
to
scream
over
a
high
school
band
play
on
the
step
of
the
lincoln
memorial
.
the
band
manage
to
stop
right
as
dunst
scream
''
you
have
to
stop
let
dick
run
you
life
!
''
much
to
the
horror
of
everyone
standing
within
earshot
.
several
other
variation
on
this
wordplay
surface
all
throughout
the
film
.
if
this
movie
have
be
smarter
i
would
have
be
less
likely
to
fault
it
be
juvenile
bathroom
humor
,
but
it
be
not
.
the
film
be
apparently
make
for
relatively
younger
people
because
every
major
player
in
the
watergate
scandal
be
introduce
and
shove
down
the
audience
's
throat
in
the
least
subtle
way
possible
.
i
do
not
recall
oliver
stone
's
nixon
have
to
pander
to
it
be
audience
,
but
of
course
that
film
be
not
a
comedy
aim
squarely
at
a
13-20
year-old
film
go
audience
.
the
only
redeeming
thing
about
this
movie
be
it
be
remarkable
support
cast
.
i
want
to
see
more
of
ferrell
and
mcculloch
's
woodward
and
bernstein
.
those
two
character
be
the
sole
basis
for
my
rating
.
i
wish
they
have
be
give
more
screen
time
,
but
unfortunately
,
they
be
only
relegate
to
the
final
half-hour
.
they
constant
bickering
and
fight
over
try
to
get
the
story
be
a
major
highlight
,
especially
mcculloch
's
constant
thwarting
of
ferrell
's
attempt
to
gather
information
from
the
girl
-lrb-
who
,
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
be
reveal
as
deep
throat
,
so
name
thanks
to
a
ill
planned
trip
to
a
porno
theater
by
betsy
's
brother
-rrb-
.
the
other
member
of
the
cast
be
excellent
in
they
portrayal
of
they
particular
character
,
but
be
give
nothing
to
work
with
.
i
would
like
to
see
the
same
cast
portray
these
character
in
a
script
more
suit
towards
they
comedic
ability
.
as
for
the
two
lead
,
dunst
and
william
can
definitely
do
better
.
they
come
off
as
what
could
best
be
describe
as
romy
and
michele
:
the
early
year
in
this
particular
film
,
a
highly
dubious
distinction
at
best
.
stay
through
the
first
half
of
the
end
credit
though
,
to
see
a
interesting
scene
involve
dunst
and
william
suggestively
suck
on
lollipop
emblazon
with
the
title
of
the
movie
.
a
excellent
idea
mar
by
poor
execution
,
dick
could
have
be
a
great
movie
.
less
of
the
juvenile
humor
and
more
of
the
smarter
comedy
display
by
the
woodward
and
bernstein
scene
,
could
have
make
this
film
a
wonderful
satire
of
the
nixon
presidency
as
see
through
the
eye
of
two
naive
fifteen
year
old
.
as
it
stand
though
,
dick
offer
nothing
but
what
filmmaker
kevin
smith
so
accurately
define
as
''
dick
and
poopie
''
joke
.
and
that
,
to
I
,
do
not
make
a
funny
movie
.
