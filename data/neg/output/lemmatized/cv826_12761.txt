i
have
always
prefer
mushroom
to
blotter
acid
.
drop
acid
be
like
ride
a
roller
coaster
blindfold
;
you
have
no
idea
where
the
peak
and
valley
be
,
no
idea
when
the
next
terrifying
decent
will
send
you
stomach
into
you
throat
,
and
no
idea
how
long
the
ride
will
last
.
then
there
be
the
hard
knot
in
you
gut
and
the
clenched
tooth
that
come
with
ingest
a
strychnine-laced
dose
.
mushroom
,
on
the
other
hand
,
offer
the
psychedelic
equivalent
of
a
leisurely
ride
on
a
ferris
wheel
:
a
steady
,
reassuring
assent
,
a
short
period
of
thrilling
motion
and
color
,
and
then
a
smooth
landing
.
acid
be
for
daredevil
;
mushroom
be
for
refined
seeker
of
joy
.
my
point
be
that
in
fear
and
loathing
in
las
vegas
,
director
terry
gilliam
have
make
a
acid
movie
,
when
i
wish
he
would
have
make
a
mushroom
movie
.
full
of
shocking
sight
gag
,
aggressive
image
and
grotesque
comic
performance
,
the
film
certainly
offer
something
for
those
fan
of
hunter
s
.
thompson
's
book
who
want
to
experience
its
twisted
pharmacological
world-view
from
the
inside
out
.
but
for
those
of
we
who
just
want
to
enjoy
a
well-made
film
,
gilliam
have
produce
a
mixed
bag
.
fear
and
loathing
tell
the
ostensibly
true
story
of
how
self-professed
''
gonzo
''
journalist
hunter
s
.
thompson
-lrb-
johnny
depp
-rrb-
and
hispanic
activist
attorney
oscar
zeta

-lrb-
benicio
del
toro
-rrb-
,
come
to
las
vegas
to
cover
a
motorcycle
race
and
find
themselves
trap
in
the
middle
of
a
district
attorney
's
convention
while
ingest
every
conceivable
drug
available
to
a
man
of
means
in
1971
.
operate
under
the
pseudonym
of
''
raoul

''
and
''
dr

gonzo
''
,
the
two
man
careen
into
vega
on
a
acid
and
mescaline
bender
,
then
hole
up
in
a
hotel
suite
to
binge
on
amyl
nitrite
,
cocaine
,
tequila
and
a
rainbow
of
multi-colored
upper
and
downer
.
they
terrorize
every
one
they

mostly
because
every
one
they
meet
terrify
they

giant
bat
on
the
way

then
be

by

in

become
enamored
of
a
thick-bladed
hunting
knife
and
beg

to
throw
the
tape
player
into
the
bathtub
with
he
just
as
jefferson
airplane
's
''
white
rabbit
''
reach
its
climax
.
and
these
guy
do
not
just
trash
hotel
room
-
they
rape
they
,
humiliate
they
and
leave
they
for
dead
.
that
neither
of
they
end
up
dead
or
in
jail
be
testament
to
blind
luck
or
providence
,
depend
on
you
point
of
view
.
thompson
's
book
,
besides
be
a
hilarious
read
,
have
stand
the
test
of
time
as
a
important
historical
document
.
it
simultaneously
expose
the
60
's
drug
culture
for
the
sham
that
it
be
and
expose
las
vegas
as
the
place
where
the
american
dream
come
to
die
.
pontificate
all
you
want
about
how
the
film
illustrate
thompson
's
message
,
but
the
truth
be
that
,
strip
to
its
bare
essential
,
what
gilliam
have
work
be
a
drug
comedy
.
it
be
a
cheech
and
chong
movie
.
you
be
there
to
watch
depp
and
del
toro
ingest
a
lot
of
chemical
and
then
laugh
at
the
result
:
see
johnny
take
drug
,
see
johnny
fall
down
.
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
this
concept
,
but
gilliam
try
too
hard
.
this
be
a
frantic
movie
-
all
sweaty
close-up
,
wide-angle
lens
,
dutch
tilt
and
other-worldly
lighting
scheme
.
there
be
time
when
gilliam
really
do
put
a
convincing
representation
of
a
acid
trip
on
the
screen
.
but
to
what
end
?
much
of
the
dialogue
come
verbatim
from
thompson
's
book
,
and
there
be
some
priceless
comic
observation
.
but
you
be
hard
press
to
hear
or
digest
they
amidst
all
the
jumbled
camera
work
.
this
bring
we
to
the
performance
,
which
strike
I
as
all
wrong
.
depp
play
thompson
as
groucho
mark
filter
through
george
c
.
scott
in
patton
-
a
gimmicky
performance
which
work
against
the
bite
satire
of
thompson
's
dialogue
.
in
between
he
several
puke
scene
,
del
toro
fare
better
as
dr
.
gonzo
,
but
he
also
mumble
and
sputter
so
many
of
he
line
that
they
weight
be
lose
.
watch
these
two
make
I
wish
that
the
movie
have
be
make
twenty
year
ago
,
with
dan
akroyd
and
john
belushus
as
the
lead
-
now
that
would
have
be
something
to
see
.
it
be
interesting
to
note
that
alex
cox
,
credit
as
a
co-writer
on
the
screenplay
,
be
originally
slate
to
direct
before
gilliam
take
over
.
as
much
of
a
fan
as
i
be
of
gilliam
's
work
,
cox
would
have
be
the
better
choice
.
sid
and
nancy
,
cox
's
best
work
,
cover
essentially
the
same
subject
matter
,
but
cox
be
able
to
pull
back
and
allow
the
character
of
sid
vicious
and
nancy
spungen
to
carry
the
film
.
gilliam
commit
the
compound
sin
of
over-directing
he
film
while
be
uncertain
of
he
purpose
.
what
kind
of
movie
be
he
try
to
make
,
anyway
?
it
do
not
try
to
be
a
cautionary
tale
,
and
it
do
not
work
as
broad
comedy
.
if
he
have
consider
more
carefully
he
purpose
,
the
result
would
have
be
a
much
more
interesting
film
.
but
i
do
not
want
to
be
too
hard
on
it
.
there
be
some
truly
funny
moment
,
and
if
you
be
in
a
good
enough
mood
you
might
get
a
kick
out
of
it
.
i
do
,
however
,
recommend
watch
fear
and
loathing
in
las
vegas
under
the
influence
of
you
favorite
controlled
substance
-
i
guarantee
it
will
enhance
the
effect
.
