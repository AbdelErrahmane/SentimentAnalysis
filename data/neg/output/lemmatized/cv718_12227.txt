there
be
scene
in
''
the
big
hit
''
that
be
so
awful
,
they
simply
defy
description
.
the
movie
be
infect
with
the
same
kind
of
blunderheaded
idiocy
and
misplace
confidence
that
make
''
last
action
hero
''
-lrb-
1993
-rrb-
such
a
chore
to
sit
through
.
presumably
,
''
the
big
hit
''
be
a
action-comedy
,
a
difficult
but
not
impossible
genre
to
pull
off
.
movie
of
this
sort
require
a
fine
balance
and
careful
tone
,
and
the
comedy
be
usually
mean
to
work
as
catharsis
for
the
violence
.
''
lethal
weapon
2
''
-lrb-
1989
-rrb-
be
a
perfect
example
of
a
action
thriller
that
be
also
very
,
very
funny
.
unfortunately
,
in
''
the
big
hit
,
''
it
seem
that
comedy
be
the
main
motive
,
and
the
violence
be
only
intend
to
punctuate
the
laugh
.
unfortunately
,
there
be
no
laugh
.
the
movie
resemble
some
of
the
goofy
,
throwaway
ridiculousness
of
early
jackie
chan
film
,
but
it
do
not
benefit
from
chan
's
incredible
stunt
and
goofy
,
charismatic
presence
.
instead
,
we
be
leave
with
a
lot
of
digital
effect
and
mark
wahlberg
,
who
must
have
consider
himself
invincible
after
he
critically-acclaimed
performance
in
last

's
''
boogie
night

''
however
,
if
he
want
to
maintain
a
decent
career
,
he
have
better
start
select

project
more
carefully
-
movie
like
this
be
a
sure-fire
recipe
for
a
long
career
in
the
straight-to-video
market
.
wahlberg
play
melvin

,
a
amiable
guy
who
also
happen
to
be
a
professional
hitman
-lrb-
see
''
grosse
pointe

''
for
the
same
character
,
much
better
develop
-rrb-
.
the
movie
want
we
to
think
,
''
gee
how
clever
and
ironic
-
a
guy
who
can
kill
without
any
moral
implication
,
and
yet
he
can
not
stand
for
anyone
not
to
like
he
.
''
the
fact
be
,
melvin
be
so
desperate
to
keep
people
from
not
like
he
,
that
he
put
up
with
both
a
obnoxious
fiancee

christina
applegate

with

horrendous
new

-rrb-
and
a
abusive
girlfriend
-lrb-
lelum
rochon
-rrb-
who
be
only
use
he
for
he
money
.
he
constant
bend
over
backwards
to
please
people
make
he
a
complete
patsy
at
best
,
and
a
thoroughly
unbelievable
character
at
worst
.
melvin
be
employ
exclusively
by
a
crime
boss
name
pari
-lrb-
avery
brook
-rrb-
as
part
of
a
team
of
hitman
,
which
also
include
cisco
-lrb-
lou
diamond
phillip
-rrb-
and
crunch
-lrb-
bokeem
woodbine
-rrb-
.
one
day
,
melvin
agree
to
do
some
moonlight
with
cisco
by
kidnapping
the
teenage
daughter
of
a
rich
japanese
mogul
name
jiro
nishus
-lrb-
sab
shimono
-rrb-
for
a
million
dollar
ransom
.
however
,
not
only
have
jiro
nishus
lose
all
he
money
produce
a
big
hollywood
movie
-lrb-
inside
joke
,
get
it
?
-rrb-
,
but
he
kidnap
daughter
,
keiko
-lrb-
china
chow
-rrb-
,
also
happen
to
be
pari

goddaughter
.
so
,
when
pari
find
out
she
be
be
kidnap
,
he
take
it
personally
and
become
determine
to
find
out
who
do
it
.
not
know
the
cisco
be
actually
behind
the
whole
scheme
,
pari
put
he
in
charge
of
root
out
the
kidnapper
.
of
course
cisco
blame
the
whole
thing
on
poor
,
innocent
melvin
.
along
the
way
,
there
be
several
obligatory
gunfight
,
explosion
,
and
car
chase
,
plus
a
literal
cliffhanger
inspire
by
''
jurassic
park
,
''
and
a
completely
unconvincing
romance
between
melvin
and
keiko
-lrb-
who
look
like
she
be
barely
push
fifteen
-rrb-
.
what
the
movie
pass
off
as
humor
resort
to
thoroughly
unfunny
joke
about
overweight
jewish
mother
,
hara-kiri
,
drinking
problem
,
leak
body
bag
,
and
a
run
gag
about
how
crunch
have
recently
discover
the
pleasure
of
masturbation
,
and
now
spend
all
he
time
do
hand
exercise
.
not
to
mention
the
pimply
video
store
clerk
who
be
always
call
melvin
and
screech
about
how
he
need
to
return
he
copy
of
''
king
kong
life
,
''
which
be
two
week
overdue
.
this
mess
of
a
movie
be
helm
by
che-kirk
wong
,
the
latest
hong
kong
director
import
by
john
woo
-lrb-
''
face\/off
''
-rrb-
,
who
also
serve
as
executive
producer
.
woo
need
to
stop
act
as
a
conduit
for
other
director
,
and
start
make
more
of
he
own
film
.
wong
,
who
direct
such
film
as
''
rock
'n'
roll
cop
''
back
in
hong
kong
,
be
completely
tone
deaf
when
it
come
to
comedy
.
maybe
joke
about
vexatious
video
clerk
and
vomit
on
other
people
be
funny
across
the
ocean
,
but
they
be
not
here
,
at
least
in
the
manner
wong
handle
they
.
many
of
the
problem
can
be
trace
back
to
the
script
,
which
be
pen
by
obvious
freshman
writer
ben
ramsey
.
in
addition
to
he
vague
characterization
and
uninspired
action
sequence
,
ramsey
's
script
assault
the
audience
with
he
attempt
to
copy
the
vulgar
,
poetic
rhythm
of
tarantino
or
mamet-style
dialogue
.
what
he
come
out
with
be
just
a
lot
of
annoying
blather
,
most
of
which
spew
from
the
lip
of
lou
diamond
phillip
-lrb-
whose
favorite
phrase
be
''
it
be
all
love
''
-rrb-
and
robin
dunne
,
who
play
cisco
's
stuttering
,
black-wannabe
assistant
.
the
irritation
factor
of
phillip
and
dunne
combine
be
almost
off
the
scale
,
which
can
pretty
much
describe
the
film
as
a
whole
.
