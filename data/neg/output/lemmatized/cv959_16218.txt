''
virus
''
be
a
monster
movie
without
a
monster
.
any
movie
with
a
hurdle
that
large
to
overcome
have
better
be
pretty
damn
good
otherwise
.
sadly
,
''
virus
''
do
not
deliver
,
on
any
level
.
the
movie
open
with
the
russian
space
station
mir
about
to
transmit
something
-lrb-
we
never
find
out
what
-rrb-
to
a
big
boat
with
lot
of
satellite
on
it
.
sudddenly
,
a
wave
of
colorful
lightning
come
fly
through
space
,
and
wind
up
destroy
mir
and
use
it
to
transmit
itself
to
the
aforementioned
big
boat
.
cut
to
seven
day
later
,
we
meet
donald
sutherland
and
he
band
of
seafaring
vulture
.
see
,
they
spend
all
they
time
sail
around
look
for
dead-in-the-water
ship
to
rescue
,
and
then
collect
the
reward
money
.
at
least
,
i
\*
think
\*
that
be
what
they
do
.
along
with
many
other
thing
in
the
film
,
they
reason
for
be
out
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
be
not
really
explain
.
so
,
they
stumble
upon
this
big
boat
with
lot
of
satellite
on
it
,
and
decide
to
haul
it
back
to
russian
water
.
the
only
problem
be
,
the
crew
start
disappear
one-by-one
and
turn
into
borg
.
yes
,
borg
.
complete
with
the
red
laser
beam
in
place
of
a
eye
.
apparently
,
this
alien
lifeform
can
only
survive
if
inside
something
electrical
.
so
,
it
create
make-shift
machine
and
use
human
for
''
spare
part
''
.
blah
,
blah
,
blah
.
i
could
go
on
forever
describe
the
ludicrous
so-called
plot
,
but
i
will
not
.
suffice
it
to
say
the
most
original
thing
about
this
movie
be
have
donald
sutherland
play
a
irish
man
-lrb-
!
-rrb-
.
everything
else
in
this
movie
have
be
take
from
other
-lrb-
better
-rrb-
movie
.
for
example
,
many
of
the
machine
resemble
those
find
in
the
little-seen
japanese
movie
,
''
tetsuo-the
iron
man
''
.
and
the
plot
be
right
out
of
''
alien
''
.
the
funny
thing
be
,
i
be
actually
expect
to
enjoy
this
movie
.
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
cheesy
monster
movie
,
like
last
year
under-appreciated
''
deep
rise
''
.
but
''
virus
''
,
as
i
mention
earlier
,
do
not
even
have
a
monster
.
it
just
have
a
big
pile
of
circuit
and
wire
and
expect
the
audience
to
fear
this
ridiculous
look
contraption
.
''
virus
''
be
the
type
of
movie
that
really
make
you
wonder
what
the
screenwriter
be
think
about
when
he
write
it
.
besides
the
lame
''
monster
''
,
it
be
chock
full
of
dialogue
that
no
real
person
would
ever
say
,
and
situation
that
no
real
person
would
ever
allow
themselves
to
get
into
.
for
example
,
there
be
a
scene
late
in
the
movie
in
which
one
of
the
character
actually
attempt
to
\*
negotiate
\*
with
the
alien
!
now
,
i
do
not
know
about
you
,
but
if
i
come
upon
a
lifeform
that
view
mankind
as
a
virus
to
be
eliminate
,
i
doubt
that
i
would
attempt
to
reason
with
it
.
that
make
about
as
much
sense
as
a
baby
squirrel
calmly
ask
a
fierce
predator
to
spare
he
life
.
finally
,
''
virus
''
be
not
scary
.
the
least
the
filmmaker
could
have
do
be
to
make
the
movie
just
a
little
scary
.
as
it
be
,
it
be
about
as
frightening
as
a
box
of
cookie
.
skip
''
virus
''
.
if
it
be
a
cool
monster
movie
you
want
,
rent
the
far
superior
-lrb-
and
the
granddaddy
of
this
genre
-rrb-
''
alien
''
.
