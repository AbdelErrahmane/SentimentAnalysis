review
by
denni
schwartz
a
black
comedy
set
in
the
near
future
in
a
board
house
run
by
a
depraved
butcher
.
the
comedy
be
play
more
in
comic
strip
style
for
entertaining
value
than
for
deeper
satire
,
as
it
feature
mostly
zany
sophomoric
sight
gag
and
rely
heavily
on
special
effect
.
the
world
have
fall
on
hard
time
and
there
be
food
shortage
which
include
no
meat
,
so
the
butcher
serve
up
meat
from
human
flesh
to
customer
who
pay
with
grain
,
almost
as
value
a
commodity
.
that
be
the
big
joke
in
the
film
and
the
novelty
of
that
cannibalism
idea
wear
thin
mighty
fast
,
as
the
character
be
too
absurd
and
sketch
too
thinly
for
we
to
care
about
they
.
this
tasteless
postapocalyptic
french
comedy
be
a
first
feature
for
the
co-director
marc
caro\/jean-pierre
jeunet
.
it
fail
to
reach
my
funny
bone
and
instead
leave
I
mostly
annoy
at
its
slight
story
and
its
dark
projection
for
the
future
.
a
ex-circus
clown
name
louison
-lrb-
dominique
pinon
-rrb-
,
the
film
's
too-good-to-be-true
hero
,
answer
a
ad
for
work
as
a
handyman
for
clapet
-lrb-
jean-claude
dreyfus
-rrb-
,
and
the
butcher
and
landlord
,
offer
he
room
and
board
in
he
house
.
the
butcher
's
clumsy
and
near-sighted
daughter
julie
-lrb-
marie-laure
dougnac
-rrb-
fall
in
love
with
the
skinny
,
weird
look
clown
,
and
the
two
make
some
music
together
,
with
she
play
the
cello
and
he
a
saw
.
they
be
the
innocent
,
surround
by
a
board
house
of
misfit
suffer
from
fear
and
watch
over
by
she
overbearing
father
,
who
have
lure
into
he
tenement
the
clown
,
as
he
have
he
past
innocent
victim
,
so
that
he
can
put
he
cleaver
to
he
and
then
sell
he
as
meat
,
which
he
intend
to
do
as
soon
as
the
clown
fix
up
the
tenement
.
the
entire
film
take
place
in
the
shabby
tenement
,
and
the
tenant
be
a
odd
lot
of
bizarre
malcontent
,
who
do
not
trust
each
other
.
there
be
two
youngster
-lrb-
boban
janevskus
&
mikael
todde
-rrb-
who
do
any
kind
of
mischief
they
can
.
a
frog
man
-lrb-
howard
vernon
-rrb-
who
live
with
water
on
the
floor
so
he
can
raise
he
frog
and
snail
that
he
eat
.
two
brother
-lrb-
mathou
&
kube
-rrb-
who
create
little
cow-moo
novelty
toy
.
a
man
-lrb-
holgado
-rrb-
who
sell
a
bullshit
detector
to
the
butcher
for
he
piece
of
meat
.
a
slutty
woman
-lrb-
karin
viard
-rrb-
,
who
live
with
the
butcher
and
only
want
he
meat
.
the
aristocratic
woman
-lrb-
silvie
laguna
-rrb-
who
try
numerous
time
to
commit
suicide
but
be
too
inept
to
do
it
right
.
the
tenant
be
too
afraid
to
come
out
at
night
because
they
know
what
the
butcher
be
up
to
,
so
they
be
force
to
communicate
with
each
other
through
a
pipe
that
run
through
the
building
-lrb-
in
one
scene
they
be
all
in
musical
harmony
to
the
lovemaking
of
the
butcher
and
he
gal
,
as
they
bedspring
squeak
-rrb-
.
there
be
also
a
sex-crazed
postman
-lrb-
chick
ortega
-rrb-
,
who
lust
for
the
butcher
's
daughter
and
carry
a
gun
while
deliver
the
mail
.
there
be
also
a
underdeveloped
subplot
about
a
band
of
incompetent
underground
veggie
fanatic
,
call
trogolodiste
,
who
have
be
summon
to
rescue
the
clown
and
steal
some
grain
.
the
director
overload
the
film
with
too
many
eccentric
,
as
the
comedy
seem
force
while
the
surreal
look
of
the
film
add
no
dramatic
intensity
.
delicatessen
could
have
some
appeal
to
the
cult
film
crowd
who
like
they
meat
sliced
thin
,
monty
python
fan
,
and
those
who
like
terry
gilliam
's
brazil
,
a
film
similar
in
spirit
.
