a
bad
guy
who
own

enforcer
type
=
cliche

at

so
we
always
hear
about

but
if
there
be
ever
to
be
a
prime
example
,
the
real
mccoy
be
it
!
not
one
utter
word
,
not
one
frame
of
film
,
not
one
character
in
this
whole
movie
be
not
a
cut
and
paste
example
of
everything
we
have
ever
see
.
they
might
as
well
use
this
as
a
training
film
:
''
how
to
make
a
bank
robbery
film
in
the
90
's
''
.
karen
mccoy
-lrb-
kim
basinger
-rrb-
be
a
bank
robber
who
just
get
out
on
parole
after
a
six-year
stay
at
the
state
prison
.
she
want
to
make
thing
right
and
go
straight
,
especially
with
the
fact
that
she
have
a
six-year
old
son
out
there
who
do
not
even
know
she
be
alive
.
aware
of
mccoy
's
bank
rob
expertise
,
snivel
bad
guy
jack
schmidt
-lrb-
terence
stamp
-rrb-
use
the
same
six-year
old
to
coerce
mccoy
into
return
to
she
past
.
he
want
mccoy
to
pull
off
a
elaborate
heist
of
18
+
million
dollar
at
the
same
bank
she
get
catch
try
to
rob
six
year
earlier
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
be
somehow
due
to
schmidt
.
and
if
she
refuse
?
who
know
what
he
'll
do
to
the
kid
.
-lrb-
cue
sinister
laughter
-rrb-
this
movie
be
so
pathetically
pitiful
that
it
be
hard
to
know
where
to
begin
.
the
aforementioned
cliche
be
brutally
abundant
.
i
can
not
stress
enough
how
every
single
element
,
whether
it
be
a
character
,
the
dialogue
,
a
plot
''
twist
''
,
etc
.
,
be
so
damn
generic
that
you
'll
wonder
if
\*
anyone
\*
be
work
behind
the
scene
,
let
alone
in
front
of
the
camera
.
basinger
be
absolutely
vacant
.
and
where
do
they
get
off
try
to
make
we
emotionally
attach
to
she
?
here
's
someone
that
spend
they
time
rob
bank
,
and
now
as
she
head
onto
the
street
,
we
be
suppose
to
feel
sorry
for
she
.
as
she
confront
she
son
,
who
do
not
even
know
who
she
be
,
be
we
suppose
to
break
into
tear
?
?
especially
when
neither
basinger
nor
zach
english
,
who
play
the
kid
,
have
any
depth
or
emotional-radiance
whatsoever
.
i
suppose
i
should
mention
val
kilmer
.
yeah
,
that
be
right
-
he
be
in
it
!
quite
sadly
too
,
see
as
how
i
can
discuss
everything
about
the
movie
and
never
mention
he
name
.
and
he
get
second
billing
!
to
be
fair
,
i
will
admit
that
kilmer
have
potential
in
he
role
as
the
bumble
criminal
wannabe
j
.
t
.
barker
.
unfortunately
the
script
do
not
allow
much
room
for
improvement
,
and
when
he
character
be
use
like
bookend
-lrb-
he
never
show
up
in
the
middle
of
the
film
!
-rrb-
,
we
have
no
time
to
appreciate
what
he
might
have
bring
to
this
project
.
the
real
mccoy
just
can
not
keep
it
be
head
above
water
,
and
soon
,
\*
very
\*
soon
,
sink
into
a
cliched
mess
of
movie
.
the
actor
be
like
dummy
be
move
about
by
a
unenthusiastic
puppeteer
,
and
the
dialogue
,
particularly
schmidt
's
trite
dialogue
,
fall
like
the
niagra
.
this
be
definitely
one
to
avoid
,
folk
.
the
real
mccoy
be
anything
but
!
