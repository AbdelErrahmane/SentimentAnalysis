bat
be
this
year
's
camp
flick
.
with
the
world
's
worst
dialogue
,
cheesiest
premise
and
stupidest
editor
,
this
one
should
be
heaven
for
those
who
enjoy
film
humorous
in
they
inanity
.
as
for
the
rest
of
we
,
well
...
i
would
say
skip
it
,
but
look
at
the
box
office
figure
for
this
one
,
it
seem
as
though
most
of
america
be
follow
that
advice
anyway
.
follow
they
lead
and
you
'll
spare
yourself
90
minute
of
you
life
and
8
buck
to
boot
.
i
love
alfr
hitchcock
's
the
bird
,
almost
as
much
as
i
love
the
short
story
on
which
it
be
base
.
it
sadden
I
even
more
,
then
,
to
see
that
american
treasure
rip
off
so
blatantly
by
wannabe
horror\/schlock
such
as
bat
.
when
mysterious
bat
attack
occur
in
a
small
texa
town
,
the
authority
call
in
a
batologist
-lrb-
dina
meyer
-rrb-
to
investigate
.
it
turn
out
that
a
creepy
scientist
-lrb-
bob
gunton
-rrb-
have
genetically
enhance
a
couple
bat
that
escape
from
he
lab
,
make
they
smarter
and
more
vicious
.
why
have
he
do
this
,
you
ask
?
because
,
you
see
,
it
be
apparently
a
scientist
's
job
to
make
thing
''
a
little
better
,
''
even
if
that
mean
the
death
of
all
mankind
.
so
the
batologist
,
she
wisecracking
sidekick
and
the
town
sheriff
-lrb-
lou
diamond
phillip
-rrb-
have
to
kill
all
the
bat
and
save
the
world
.
of
course
,
that
can
not
happen
before
they
wallow
in
some
guamo
-lrb-
bat
shit
,
for
the
uninitiated
-rrb-
,
get
up
close
and
personal
with
some
truly
repulsive
fly
mammal
and
survive
some
of
the
dumbest
situation
ever
see
in
a
professionally
produce
motion
picture
.
consider
,
for
example
,
a
scene
where
two
people
be
in
a
bat
cave
.
the
bat
be
all
sleep
,
but
the
human
be
afraid
they
might
wake
up
before
they
can
get
out
.
what
do
they
do
?
do
they
get
the
hell
out
of
there
as
fast
as
they
can
?
nope
.
they
stand
there
for
a
while
,
transfix
by
the
thousand
of
bat
open
they
eye
.
what
keep
bat
from
be
scary
or
creepy
be
the
hyperactive
editing
in
most
of
the
attack
scene
.
we
do
not
even
get
to
see
what
be
go
on
;
the
screen
become
a
mush
because
the
cut
be
so
quick
.
all
we
know
be
that
bat
be
attack
.
how
they
be
attack
and
what
exactly
be
happen
remain
a
mystery
.
a
little
technical
proficiency
do
wonder
for
horror
movie
,
and
bat
sure
could
use
some
.
of
course
,
director
loui
morneau
try
to
liven
thing
up
with
some
intentional
humor
,
but
it
be
so
conventional
it
do
not
really
go
anywhere
.
most
of
the
ocmic
relief
come
courtesy
of
the
batologist
's
wisecrack
sidekick
-lrb-
leon
-rrb-
,
who
take
every
opportunity
to
sputter
ingenious
line
like
''
i
hate
bat
!
''
some
of
these
be
so
bad
that
they
take
on
a
double
quality
:
they
may
inspire
a
smirk
by
they
very
nature
and
a
roar
laugh
because
they
be
so
inept
.
i
hate
character
who
exist
for
the
sole
purpose
of
spout
lame
one-liner
.
play
such
character
do
not
help
actor
'
career
.
still
,
i
suppose
that
if
you
be
look
for
a
movie
that
be
''
so
bad
it
be
good
,
''
you
could
do
worse
than
bat
.
it
do
have
a
tremendous
amount
of
camp
value
.
i
be
not
''
recommend
''
the
movie
because
,
quite
frankly
,
it
suck
,
and
i
know
that
this
might
convince
some
people
to
go
out
and
see
it
.
more
power
to
they
.
