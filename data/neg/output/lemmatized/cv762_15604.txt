if
you
be
go
to
make
a
two-hour
hollywood
in-joke
,
why
bother
release
it
to
the
general
public
?
if
you
be
go
to
create
a
film
that
will
appeal
primarily
to
big-name
actor
and
people
who
know
woody
allen
,
then
why
waste
the
time
of
the
rest
of
we
peon
by
play
it
in
theater
?
while
watch
celebrity
,
i
realize
that
allen
have
only
marginal
interest
in
create
a
story
about
real
people
.
what
he
really
want
to
do
be
continue
on
he
recent
kick
of
conceited
self-deprecation
.
celebrity
be
yet
another
film
in
which
allen
tell
a
story
about
himself
,
live
in
a
world
that
he
be
familiar
with
,
deal
with
people
like
the
one
he
actually
know
.
allen
recruit
poor
kenneth
branagh
to
bumble
through
this
picture
,
in
a
imitation
of
allen
so
perfect
that
it
almost
make
I
like
the
film
more
.
branagh
play
lee
simon
,
a
journalist-turned-screenwriter
who
divorce
he
wife
,
robin
-lrb-
judy
davi
-rrb-
,
shack
up
with
some
hot
woman
-lrb-
famke
janssen
,
charlize
theron
,
winona
ryder
-rrb-
,
and
go
about
try
to
get
big
star
-lrb-
melanie
griffith
,
leonardo
dicaprio
-rrb-
to
read
he
script
about
a
armored
car
robbery
.
the
usual
element
of
recent
allen
film
be
all
here
,
include
the
sexual
insecurity
of
the
main
character
,
lot
of
self-loathing
woman
,
and
a
tiring
continuum
of
episode
that
be
only
loosely
related
to
one
another
.
unless
you
work
in
the
film
industry
or
know
woody
allen
personally
,
it
be
not
likely
that
you
'll
find
a
whole
lot
of
interest
in
celebrity
.
aside
from
all
the
in-joke
,
the
story
fall
far
short
of
compelling
,
and
the
character
be
all
empty
and
lifeless
.
branagh
prove
once
again
that
he
be
a
superb
performer
,
nail
he
imitation
of
allen
flawlessly
.
the
problem
be
that
he
be
the
same
character
allen
always
play
,
a
character
who
be
get
more
than
a
little
dull
to
watch
.
i
mean
,
come
on
,
how
many
time
have
you
see
this
guy
?
--
he
hate
he
work
,
and
he
can
not
be
satisfy
by
any
one
woman
,
and
,
at
the
end
of
the
movie
,
nothing
have
be
solve
.
he
bring
all
of
he
problem
upon
himself
-lrb-
crash
he
car
because
he
be
receive
fellatio
,
and
other
such
stunt
-rrb-
,
so
it
be
pretty
hard
to
care
about
he
.
in
addition
,
be
not
allen
capable
of
create
character
who
be
not
just
like
he
?
i
know
he
be
,
but
he
do
not
do
it
in
celebrity
.
the
vacant
emotional
attachment
with
the
main
character
be
not
recapture
in
the
support
performance
.
davi
,
play
the
same
woman
with
low
self-esteem
that
she
play
in
deconstruct
harry
,
have
a
few
touching
moment
,
but
end
up
the
same
despicable
celebrity-type
that
fill
the
rest
of
the
movie
.
some
of
the
actress
be
save
because
of
they
beauty
--
theron
and
ryder
,
especially
--
but
they
be
not
likable
people
.
only
famke
janssen
,
as
a
book
editor
interested
in
simon
's
new
novel
,
have
any
life
.
the
man
in
the
picture
do
not
do
much
better
--
joe
mantegna
be
pretty
dull
as
the
man
who
remarry
robin
,
while
dicaprio
,
as
a
christian
slater\/johnny
depp-type
spoil
young
actor
,
be
funny
but
disengage
.
what
be
really
insulting
about
celebrity
be
how
dull
and
standard
its
''
theme
''
be
.
allen
seem
to
think
that
he
be
make
a
insightful
movie
about
the
way
''
normal
''
people
look
at
celebrity
.
the
main
problem
with
this
be
that
the
character
with
whom
we
be
suppose
to
identify
,
simon
,
be
not
a
''
normal
''
guy
--
he
be
just
as
entrench
in
the
hollywood
image
as
the
rest
of
the
character
.
the
other
problem
be
that
the
image
we
get
of
these
celebrity
be
no
more
enlighten
than
the
view
the
media
give
we
--
none
of
they
register
as
realistic
,
interesting
character
;
they
mostly
just
function
as
set
piece
for
boring
dialogue
.
in
addition
,
allen
decide
he
need
a
scene
in
which
the
theme
be
express
explicitly
-lrb-
robin
,
in
this
scene
,
say
something
like
,
''
it
be
interesting
to
see
the
way
we
all
look
at
the
people
we
celebrate
!
''
-rrb-
.
celebrity
be
arguably
allen
's
biggest
misfire
to
date
.
it
do
have
a
few
good
scene
--
theron
's
super-orgasmic
model
character
be
kind
of
funny
,
and
the
last
scene
might
have
be
move
have
the
rest
of
the
film
show
we
a
character
or
two
.
but
celebrity
be
a
failure
at
the
core
,
unless
allen
's
point
be
to
make
a
self-indulgent
movie
about
himself
and
he
friend
.
if
he
want
to
make
he
audience
feel
like
they
be
on
the
outside
of
a
big
joke
,
then
he
succeed
in
that
.
i
,
for
one
,
do
not
enjoy
feel
like
a
outsider
.
