in
life
:
they
be
constantly
pick

in
school
,
and
now
they
can
not
hold
regular
job
.
but
as
the
trailer
go
,
''
there
be
one
thing
mitch

be
good
at

revenge

so
he
and

parlay
they
unmatched
skill
in

scheme
into

marketable
revenge-for-hire
business

this
should
be
the
groundwork
for
a
wonderfully
wicked
black
comedy
,
but
for
a
film
call
_

_
,
what
ensue
be
rather
clean
of
spirit
.
in
fact
,
what
make
mitch
and
sam
start
up
they
business
be
not
a
giddy
desire
to
give
bully
a
taste
of
they
own
medicine
,
but
rather
a
more
sappy
reason
:
sam

a

transplant
,
and
in
order
for
he
to

for

so
for
all
the
scheming
that
go
on
,
beneath
every
underhanded
plot
be
--
gasp
!
--
a
heart
,
which
undercut
the
inherent
nastiness
of
the
premise
.
not
that
there
be
not
a
lot
of
nastiness
on
display
--
there
be
,
but
of
a
different
sort
.
there
be
frequent
sexual
reference
,
most
prominently
in
the
form
of

and
sam
's
impotent
father
's
ongoing
lust
for

the

it
