ironically
,
one
of
the
theme
of
200
cigarette
be
that
you
should
try
to
make
the
best
of
every
moment
in
life
.
unfortunately
i
will
no
longer
be
able
to
say
that
i
live
every
moment
of
my
life
to
the
fullest
,
because
i
spend
95
otherwise
perfectly
good
minute
,
watch
this
sad
excuse
for
a
movie
.
actually
smoking
200
cigarette
in
the
same
95
minute
could
not
be
any
worse
for
you
than
it
be
to
watch
the
movie
.
not
only
be
it
a
pathetically
bad
film
overall
,
but
200
cigarette
actually
have
no
redeeming
quality
whatsoever
.
the
plot
be
scatter
,
thin
and
predictable
;
the
acting
be
monumentally
bad
;
and
the
style
of
film
make
resemble
a
home
video
.
it
be
December
31
,
1981
and
the
big
party
be
at
monica
's
-lrb-
martha
plimpton
-rrb-
house
.
but
no
one
have
arrive
yet
.
she
8
invite
guest
and
several
people
that
they
have
pick
throughout
the
evening
be
wander
the
street
of
new
york
city
in
various
group
.
some
of
they
know
each
other
through
they
common
bond
of
have
sleep
with
monica
,
and
some
be
total
stranger
.
but
they
all
be
to
face
they
own
personal
neurosis
before
night
's
end
.
those
who
be
invite
be
the
one
that
have
the
issue
.
it
be
up
to
those
who
be
not
to
help
they
come
to
term
.
first
there
be
eric
-lrb-
brian
mccardie
-rrb-
who
be
a
former
boyfriend
of
monica
's
and
be
just
get
over
the
heartbreak
of
they
relationship
terminate
prematurely
because
of
he
sexual
performance
,
or
lack
thereof
.
he
be
one
of
the
most
bland
character
,
in
a
film
full
of
dullness
,
because
he
be
so
utterly
predictable
and
stereotypical
,
a
common
trait
of
this
poor
production
.
bridget
-lrb-
nicole
parker
-rrb-
and
caitlyn
-lrb-
angelum
featherstone
-rrb-
who
be
both
extremely
sensuous
young
woman
look
for
someone
to
handle
they
desire
on
new
year
's
eve
and
tag
along
to
the
party
with
they
.
they
stumble
across
a
nameless
bartender
-lrb-
ben
affleck
-rrb-
who
be
the
one
truly
perfect
character
in
a
film
of
imperfection
.
he
be
nether
sexually
deprive
,
nor
uncertain
about
he
future
,
as
he
be
in
law
school
.
he
lack
of
flaw
be
both
boring
,
unrealistic
and
painful
to
watch
.
as
bridget
and
caitlyn
make
pass
at
he
you
be
neither
entertain
nor
humor
by
the
sub-standard
comedy
.
move
on
,
there
be
val
-lrb-
christina
riccus
-rrb-
and
stephie
,
-lrb-
gabby
hoffman
-rrb-
2
teenage
girl
with
fake
identification
and
very
different
thought
.
val
be
monica
's
cousin
and
a
true
fan
of
the
new
york
scene
.
on
the
other
hand
,
stephie
be
convince
that
she
be
vulnerable
to
crime
when
the
two
venture
out
of
they
usual
location
in
search
of
the
party
that
they
just
can
not
find
.
paradoxically
,
it
be
2
punk
that
they
meet
at
a
bar
-lrb-
actually
they
attempt
to
flee
from
they
presence
,
but
be
not
successful
-rrb-
who
guide
they
through
they
fear
and
force
a
level
of
relaxation
upon
they
warped
mind
.
of
all
the
insanely
dull
and
uninteresting
couple
,
only
one
approach
a
level
of
decency
in
both
act
and
plot
.
wisely
,
the
movie
's
creator
have
put
heavy
emphasis
on
lucy
-lrb-
courtney
love
-rrb-
and
kevin
-lrb-
paul
rudd
-rrb-
who
be
best
friend
and
share
the
common
bond
of
be
dateless
.
paul
have
just
break
up
with
long
time
steady
ellie
-lrb-
janeane
garofalo
-rrb-
and
be
start
to
come
to
term
with
he
loss
when
lucy
inform
he
that
ellie
have
be
sleep
around
during
they
relationship
.
however
,
the
only
complexity
to
these
two
character
be
that
they
seem
to
want
to
be
more
than
friend
,
and
that
be
reiterate
when
they
attempt
sexual
intercourse
in
a
bathroom
stall
on
more
than
one
occasion
during
this
strange
evening
.
finally
,
there
be
the
two
worst
performance
and
worst
sub-plot
of
the
film
.
jack
-lrb-
jay
mohr
-rrb-
and
cindy
-lrb-
kate
hudson
-rrb-
have
be
go
out
for
a
short
period
of
time
and
jack
just
learn
that
he
take
cindy
's
virginity
the
night
before
.
while
she
attempt
to
play
this
down
and
be
she
usual
self
,
he
be
a
predictably
self
loathing
male
as
he
attempt
to
deal
with
a
string
of
one
night
stand
that
include
the
recently
deflower
cindy
.
very
often
,
when
a
film
be
as
putrid
as
this
production
,
there
will
at
least
be
a
decent
quality
of
film
make
to
reveal
a
occasional
moment
of
glory
.
however
,
this
film
have
neither
the
quality
of
cinematography
nor
the
moment
of
glory
to
be
highlight
.
instead
,
what
you
get
be
a
collection
of
rough
and
inconsistent
cut
,
bad
continuity
and
inaccuracy
.
first
,
and
most
noticeable
be
that
as
the
film
go
from
one
subplot
to
another
,
there
be
no
apparent
order
that
it
follow
,
and
it
be
also
weeken
by
unnecessarily
edgy
edit
from
scene
to
scene
and
shot
to
shot
.
at
other
time
,
object
seem
to
get
up
and
move
and
hairstyle
and
costume
change
from
shoot
to
shot
.
there
be
also
at
least
4
scene
in
a
taxi
cab
that
go
from
start
to
finish
.
not
in
a
single
one
of
they
do
anybody
pay
the
driver
.
and
yet
,
no
matter
how
miserable
this
film
may
be
,
and
no
matter
how
poor
the
acting
be
all
around
,
there
be
a
ray
of
a
hope
for
these
many
bad
plot
.
perhaps
,
if
the
maker
have
just
decide
to
concentrate
on
one
or
two
or
,
perhaps
,
even
three
,
there
might
have
be
the
time
and
opportunity
for
some
character
development
,
or
quality
acting
,
or
even
a
decent
plot
payoff
at
the
end
.
but
it
do
not
happen
that
way
.
the
cast
of
quality
name
actor
be
force
into
role
that
not
even
one
of
they
could
convert
into
a
mediocre
performance
,
and
every
story
line
crash
and
burn
quicker
than
it
take
for
the
ball
to
drop
at
midnight
.
