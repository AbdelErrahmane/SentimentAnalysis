one
of
the
90
'
most
unwelcome
thriller
trend
return
from
the
grave
:
it
be
the
''
___
from
hell
''
movie
!
start
in
the
early
ninety
,
we
be
subject
to
nearly
every
conceivable
combination
of
relationships-from-hell
!
there
be
boyfriend
from
hell
,
friendly
neighborhood
cop
from
hell
,
nanny
from
hell
,
and
even
secretary
from
hell
.
but
hush
have
find
a
old
standby
that
somehow
be
forget
in
the
rush
:
the
mother-in-law
from
hell
!
!
!
!
!
the
mother-in-law
in
question
be
martha
,
play
by
jessica
lange
.
she
have
be
single-handedly
run
the
family
horse
farm
,
kilronan
.
she
son
,
jackson
-lrb-
johnathon
schaech
-rrb-
and
he
girlfriend
,
helen
-lrb-
gwyneth
paltrow
-rrb-
,
live
in
new
york
,
and
have
no
intention
to
move
back
down
south
to
the
rural
kilronan
.
but
those
intention
be
about
to
change
.
you
see
,
martha
life
by
manipulation
.
she
have
use
it
in
year
past
to
breed
many
championship
horse
.
now
,
she
believe
she
can
use
it
to
breed
herself
a
grandson
.
though
at
first
,
helen
find
martha
charming
,
soon
she
be
catch
in
the
domineering
martha
's
web
of
deception
.
it
be
hard
to
understand
why
nobody
ever
wise
up
to
martha
'
scheme
.
as
write
,
most
of
the
character
in
the
film
must
be
very
slow
wit
.
but
then
,
the
film
even
treat
the
audience
like
idiot
.
it
try
to
get
away
with
thing
-lrb-
like
leave
a
critical
piece
of
evidence
in
a
rather
unlikely
place
-rrb-
without
even
batting
a
eye
.
then
again
a
audience
which
accept
character
as
shallow
as
these
be
not
one
that
be
likely
to
question
detail
.
jessica
lange
's
martha
be
the
only
semi-developed
character
in
the
film
,
and
she
apply
she
talent
to
redeem
it
as
much
as
she
can
.
a
character
that
could
have
be
simply
awful
be
merely
groan-worthy
.
gwyneth
paltrow
do
not
have
much
to
build
upon
,
as
helen
's
only
character
trait
seem
to
be
''
daughter-in-law
''
.
still
,
she
fare
better
than
johnathon
schaech
,
whose
character
be
so
nonexistent
,
he
be
inexplicably
miss
for
much
of
the
film
.
still
,
there
have
be
much
worse
''
____
from
hell
''
film
.
even
with
its
paper-thin
character
and
ludicrous
setup
,
hush
manage
to
create
a
few
thrill
in
a
color-by-numbers
fashion
.
you
know
what
be
come
,
but
occasionally
the
film
will
deliver
a
shock
or
two
.
the
old
formula
be
around
for
a
reason
,
but
that
do
not
mean
they
taste
fresh
.
