early
on
they
journey
they
meet
paul
sarone
-lrb-
jon
voight
-rrb-
whose
boat
be
stick
on
the
shore
.
they
agree
to
give
he
a
ride
to
the
next
village
.
he
claim
to
know
the
area
well
and
can
be
useful
locate
the
native
tribe
.
very
soon
they
friendliness
backfire
on
the
group
because
sarone
turn
out
to
be
a
snake
hunter
without
scruple
who
only
want
to
catch
a
giant
anaconda
and
sell
it
to
a
zoo
.
we
do
not
have
to
wait
too
long
for
the
giant
snake
.
she
just
have
a
panther
hor
d'oevre
and
now
be
look
for
the
main
course
.
we
hero
paddle
around
in
the
amazona
as
if
it
be
the
pool
in
they
own
backyard
.
no
wonder
giant
animal
mistake
they
splashing
for
a
dinner
bell
.
we
anaconda
be
a
polite
one
and
swallow
the
first
victim
in
one
big
gulp
.
enjoy
!
so
much
for
the
first
attempt
to
catch
she
.
but
who
would
want
to
catch
a
giant
snake
with
a
fishing
pole
?
we
villain
sarone
show
he
soft
side
when
he
stop
terri
from
shoot
the
snake
.
too
bad
that
anaconda
be
just
about
to
strangle
another
member
of
the
expedition
.
one
by
one
she
go
after
the
other
.
eric
stoltz
be
sting
by
a
giant
wasp
right
in
the
beginning
and
be
mercifully
unconcious
for
the
rest
of
the
adventure
.
the
rest
of
the
crew
keep
entertain
the
viewer
although
not
the
way
the
maker
of
the
movie
have
plan
.
however
the
scene
without
the
anaconda
be
rather
boring
.
whenever
the
lead
lady
show
up
we
be
in
for
a
laugh
.
the
snake
remind
we
of
a
favorite
character
of
a
famous
animated
movie
even
if
she
should
be
a
awe-inspiring
monster
.
she
attack
always
follow
the
same
plan
:
one
last
hypnotic
look
-
she
be
look
at
you
,
kid
-
then
she
speedily
wrap
herself
around
she
victim
and
start
to
gush
it
down
.
mostly
we
do
not
see
the
act
of
devour
.
but
she
look
nice
when
she
wiggle
away
with
she
bulge
middle
part
.
whoever
do
the
special
effect
on
this
movie
may
have
want
to
go
to
a
zoo
first
and
study
some
real
snake
.
maybe
then
the
anaconda
model
would
have
look
more
real
.
the
animatronic
be
somewhat
more
believable
.
but
that
do
not
work
for
the
strangle
scene
.
do
not
go
see
the
movie
for
the
f\/x
.
they
be
everything
but
up-to-date
.
the
viewer
who
like
to
watch
the
end
credit
will
see
to
his\/her
surprise
that
a
snake
expert
be
a
consultant
for
the
team
.
we
may
doubt
though
that
he
have
ever
see
the
final
result
of
he
work
.
a
well
know
american
science
magazine
be
also
mention
in
the
credit
,
but
i
will
refrain
from
name
it
here
to
avoid
further
damage
to
its
reputation
.
the
majority
of
viewer
will
have
leave
the
theater
as
soon
as
the
credit
start
roll
,
anyway
.
what
kind
of
audience
be
the
target
group
for
this
movie
?
hard
to
say
.
this
can
not
be
a
serious
horror
movie
,
or
can
it
?
see
for
yourself
.
