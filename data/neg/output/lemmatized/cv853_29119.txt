it
be
a
shame
the
execution
of
this
concept
fall
very
short
of
its
premise
.
the
movie
be
lack
and
most
unsatisfying
.
osmosis
jone
be
crude
,
gross
,
disgusting
,
and
be
direct
by
the
farrelly
brother
-
the
twisted
sibling
behind
there
be
something
about
mary
,
I
,
myself
and
irene
and
a
couple
of
other
movie
in
which
the
humor
be
mostly
target
below
the
belt
.
not
that
there
be
anything
wrong
with
scatology
.
i
bet
even
cavemen
appreciate
bathroom
humor
-
such
as
it
be
.
it
be
merely
that
with
osmosis
jone
,
the
farrelly
humor
be
too
juvenile
,
too
predictable
.
you
can
almost
foresee
the
pun
just
by
view
the
part
of
the
inner
anatomy
a
sequence
be
draw
.
osmosis
jone
look
like
one
of
those
old
health
class
movie
go
psycho
.
the
trouble
be
,
the
animation
may
please
the
very
young
,
but
the
joke
may
be
over
they
head
,
while
the
teen-age
audience
may
find
it
too
tame
for
they
taste
.
adult
?
well
,
let
's
just
say
most
will
find
it
unappetizing
.
osmosis
jone
play
like
a
100-minute
infomercial
for
the
eat
healthy
food
lobby
.
the
live
action
sequence
revolve
around
frank
-lrb-
bill
murray
-rrb-
,
who
seem
to
be
the
grungiest
human
be
in
the
universe
.
he
continually
look
as
if
he
need
a
shave
and
a
shower
.
frank
,
much
to
the
consternation
of
he
daughter
,
be
a
fast-food
addict
,
eat
anything
-
and
everything
-
that
can
kill
you
.
he
work
at
a
zoo
where
the
animal
look
cleaner
-
and
presumably
smell
better
-
than
he
do
.
frank
's
body
be
invade
by
thrax
,
a
lethal
virus
,
after
frank
eat
a
hard-boiled
egg
that
have
fall
to
the
ground
.
it
be
not
gross
enough
that
frank
pick
the
egg
up
from
the
dirt
and
plop
it
into
he
mouth
.
nope
,
the
farrelly
pile
it
on
by
first
have
frank
wrestle
a
chimp
for
the
egg
,
wrest
it
from
the
primate
's
mouth
.
like
i
say
,
the
gross
meter
tip
the
scale
on
this
one
.
after
ingest
the
egg
,
the
movie
begin
its
animated
sequence
.
here
,
osmosis
jone
-lrb-
voice
by
chri
rock
-rrb-
,
a
renegade
white
blood
cell
be
team
with
drix
-lrb-
voice
by
frasier
's
david
hyde
pierce
-rrb-
,
a
12-hour
,
painkiller
cold
capsule
to
battle
thrax
-lrb-
smoothly
voice
by
laurence
fishburne
-rrb-
.
basically
,
what
we
have
be
a
cliched
cop-buddy
movie
,
rife
with
all
the
clich
?
s
of
that
genre
.
and
this
be
why
osmosis
jone
do
not
click
.
it
merely
fall
back
on
tired
,
familiar
convention
instead
of
create
new
and
exciting
situation
.
the
joke
and
pun
be
lame
:
osmosis
search
out
a
snitch
,
a
former
flu
virus
.
after
pump
he
for
information
,
drix
tell
osmosis
,
''
funny
,
he
do
not
look
fluish
.
''
and
the
joke
do
not
rise
above
that
level
.
the
live
action
scene
be
no
better
.
frank
be
such
a
slob
,
so
unappealing
that
it
be
difficult
to
fathom
how
he
ever
marry
or
even
sire
a
child
.
he
be
almost
a
bigger
cartoon
than
the
animated
character
.
osmosis
jone
be
a
movie
that
may
be
too
violent
for
young
child
as
thrax
burn
and
dissolve
blood
cell
right
and
left
.
the
animation
be
rather
two-dimensional
and
flat
.
it
lack
scope
and
depth
.
it
be
a
unappealing
movie
that
will
leave
you
scratch
you
head
,
and
maybe
lean
toward
a
shower
after
you
walk
out
of
the
theater
.
