vega
vacation
be
the
fourth
film
star
chevy
chase
and
beverly
d'angelo
as
the
head
of
the
hapless
griswold
family
.
as
with
the
other
three
film
,
they
two
child
,
rusty
and
audrey
,
be
play
by
a
revolving
series
of
actor
.
this
time
ethan
embry
and
marisol
nichol
fill
the
role
.
also
back
,
be
cousin
eddie
-lrb-
randy
quaid
-rrb-
,
the
slob
relative
who
seem
to
bring
problem
wherever
he
go
.
in
vega
vacation
clark
griswold
-lrb-
chase
-rrb-
decide
to
take
the
family
on
vacation
to
las
vegas
so
that
he
and
wife
ellen
-lrb-
d'angelo
-rrb-
can
renew
they
wedding
vow
.
it
be
at
this
point
when
comedy
be
suppose
to
ensue
.
apparently
the
filmmaker
think
that
put
the
griswold
into
las
vegas
would
be
so
funny
on
its
own
that
they
would
not
bother
to
write
any
joke
into
the
script
.
at
least
that
be
the
way
it
look
when
watch
this
turkey
.
about
half
way
through
vega
vacation
i
begin
to
have
serious
doubt
as
to
whether
there
would
actually
be
a
single
laugh
in
the
entire
film
,
since
there
have
be
none
up
to
that
point
.
by
the
end
of
the
movie
i
have
actually
snicker
a
couple
of
time
,
and
i
have
smile
at
a
couple
of
gag
.
i
might
add
that
none
of
the
funny
-lrb-
and
i
use
the
term
loosely
-rrb-
moment
come
as
a
result
of
anything
chase
,
d'angelo
or
quaid
be
involve
in
.
they
might
as
well
have
stay
home
for
as
much
as
they
contribute
to
this
film
.
the
two
best
thing
in
this
movie
be
ethan
embry
and
marisol
nichol
as
the
griswold
kid
,
who
manage
to
have
a
couple
of
they
own
adventure
.
rusty
become
a
vegas
high
roller
,
provide
most
of
the
film
's
best
moment
.
every
time
chase
and
quaid
be
involve
in
a
gag
,
it
just
make
it
more
and
more
apparent
that
they
should
have
stop
this
series
after
the
third
film
.
which
bring
I
to
the
best
moment
of
the
film
.
the
griswold
be
drive
down
the
highway
and
holiday
road
-lrb-
the
theme
from
the
original
vacation
-rrb-
begin
to
play
.
christie
brinkley
and
she
red
ferrarus
-lrb-
also
from
the
first
movie
-rrb-
drive
by
.
it
be
a
cute
moment
,
but
all
it
really
do
be
remind
I
just
how
funny
the
first
film
have
be
,
and
just
how
far
that
this
series
have
fall
.
too
bad
.
