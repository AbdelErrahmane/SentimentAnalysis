capsule
:
the
run
gag
pair
of
character
from
all
of
kevin
smith
's
film
get
they
own
movie
.
the
gag
be
sporadically
funny
.
it
be
more
than
occasionally
funny
for
teens
who
be
fond
of
scatological
humor
and
anti-gay
joke
.
the
plot
be
weak
and
the
lead
be
not
a
particularly
funny
comic
team
.
the
little
inside
joke
and
dig
at
other
entertainment
and
particularly
at
kevin
smith
film
be
the
best
feature
of
the
film
.
sadly
for
I
they
be
just
not
funny
enough
to
make
the
film
worth
watch
.
this
feel
like
the
high
school
skit
that
that
the
principal
would
not
let
the
kid
do
on
talent
night
.
-lrb-
and
it
turn
out
he
have
very
good
reason
.

a
film
need
a
plot
.
it
need
character
for
empathy
value
.
it
need
a
story
and
a
emotional
center
.
if
a
film
be
just
a
chain
of
joke
it
can
only
be
so
good
and
any
entertainment
value
will
succeed
or
fail
base
on
how
funny
the
joke
be
.
kevin
smith
have
now
make
two
satisfy
film
,
clerk
and
chase
amy
.
with
dogma
he
try
to
make
a
philosophical
religious
comedy
and
mixed
with
a
madcap
romp
.
peter
cook
and
dudley
moore
do
that
very
successfully
with
they
bedazzle
.
but
get
the
combination
to
work
be
very
hard
to
do
right
and
kevin
smith
's
fecal
monster
in
dogma
be
not
the
way
to
do
it
.
he
remain
two
film
,
mallrat
and
he
new
jay
and
silent
bob
strike
back
be
aim
squarely
at
a
teenage
audience
.
jay
and
silent
bob
strike
back
be
a
compendium
of
gay
joke
,
penis
joke
,
flatulence
joke
,
film
pastiche
,
and
in-joke
.
how
funny
the
joke
be
will
be
a
subjective
call
.
for
I
,
the
vast
majority
of
the
joke
be
just
not
very
funny
.
there
be
not
enough
cleverness
or
variety
.
it
be
funny
at
most
once
or
twice
to
accuse
someone
of
be
gay
.
penis
joke
work
only
so
many
time
.
show
up
as
minor
character
in
every
kevin
smith
film
jay
and
silent
bob
be
a
clever
pair
of
human
run
gag
.
they
be
sort
of
the
modern
equivalent
of
naunton
wayne
and
basil
radford
,
the
comic
duo
who
show
up
satirize
the
english
middle
class
in
several
good
british
post-war
film
include
dead
of
night
,
the
lady
vanish
,
and
passport
to
pimlico
.
jay
and
silent
bob
be
originally
supposedly
typical
generation
x
stoner
.
as
the
series
wear
on
they
have
larger
and
larger
part
.
in
jay
and
silent
bob
strike
back
they
be
the
lead
.
jay
and
silent
bob
-lrb-
play
by
jason
mewe
and
kevin
smith
-rrb-
be
chase
away
from
the
front
of
the
convenience
store
where
they
be
deal
drug
in
clerk
.
this
leave
they
at
loose
end
.
they
be
not
sure
what
would
be
worthwhile
to
do
with
they
life
when
they
hear
that
a
comic
book
with
character
visually
model
on
they
will
be
adapt
into
a
movie
.
they
decide
to
devote
they
life
to
wreck
the
movie
or
get
some
of
that
big
movie
industry
cash
.
so
it
be
off
to
hollywood
to
shake
down
the
movie
company
and
have
adventure
along
the
way
.
the
film
be
mostly
about
they
adventure
on
the
road
and
when
they
get
to
hollywood
the
problem
with
this
comedy
team
be
that
neither
really
pull
he
weight
to
make
the
film
funny
.
silent
bob
,
be
silent
,
can
only
contribute
to
the
comedy
by
react
with
that
very
expressive
face
of
he
.
this
make
he
piece
of
the
comedy
even
less
than
a
straight
man
like
a
dean
martin
or
bud
abbott
would
have
.
jay
have
to
be
the
comic
.
he
could
carry
the
load
for
both
if
he
be
extremely
inventive
.
the
problem
be
that
he
be
not
sufficiently
funny
.
he
be
too
bland
to
be
the
comic
half
and
he
line
just
do
not
show
any
comic
flair
.
so
jay
and
silent
bob
be
a
long
way
from
be
a
successful
comic
team
.
they
star
role
and
the
low
humor
make
this
a
comedy
for
those
young
at
mind
and
for
people
who
can
laugh
at
gag
they
have
see
before
--
sometimes
just
minute
before
.
like
dogma
before
it
,
but
definitely
not
like
chase
amy
,
this
film
feel
more
like
a
amateurish
skit
than
a
real
movie
.
certainly
neither
the
plot
nor
the
character
be
at
all
involve
.
they
be
excuse
for
gag
,
many
of
which
still
fall
flat
.
it
be
dogma
without
any
of
the
humorous
theological
content
.
the
film
do
not
offer
much
to
a
adult
audience
.
i
rate
it
4
on
the
0
to
10
scale
and
a
low
0
on
the
-4
to
+4
scale
.
