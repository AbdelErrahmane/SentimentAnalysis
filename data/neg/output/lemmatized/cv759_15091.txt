vampire
start
out
almost
in
the
style
of
a
spaghetti
western
with
a
attack
on
a
small
homestead
in
new
mexico
.
the
house
have
a
nest
of
vampire
and
jack
crow
-lrb-
jame
wood
-rrb-
be
lead
a
team
of
vampire
hunter
in
to
clean
they
out
.
while
the
initial
imagery
be
a
little
over-dramatic
,
it
give
way
to
what
be
a
fairly
decent
action
sequence
.
that
be
enough
action
to
last
we
a
while
and
we
could
,
director
john
carpenter
would
let
we
,
get
to
a
story
line
.
but
it
be
not
very
long
and
there
be
not
much
plot
until
the
next
big
action
scene
.
then
there
be
only
a
bit
more
of
plot
before
the
next
action
scene
after
that
.
the
plot
be
keep
to
a
minimum
and
the
interesting
idea
in
the
plot
really
get
the
short
end
.
and
that
be
something
of
a
pity
because
the
film
,
base
on
the
book
vampire
$
by
john
steakley
,
give
we
a
myth
for
the
origin
of
vampire
and
explain
why
vampire
be
so
intertwine
with
religious
imagery
.
this
could
be
a
interesting
departure
from
the
standard
vampire
film
,
but
carpenter
decide
to
tell
we
about
it
rather
than
to
show
it
.
what
carpenter
save
he
serious
screen
time
for
a
sequence
of
spectacular
fight
between
hunter
and
vampire
.
there
be
a
lot
of
fight
and
lot
of
gore
.
anything
intriguing
be
keep
to
a
minimum
to
so
it
do
not
get
in
the
way
of
please
the
action
film
fan
.
this
have
not
always
be
carpenter
's
style
.
he
1981
version
of
the
thing
have
action
but
also
challenge
the
viewer
to
do
a
little
think
about
the
film
's
central
science
fictional
question
.
jack
crow
head
a
vampire
swat
team
,
clean
up
nest
of
vampire
with
high-tech
spear
and
crossbow
.
in
the
early
part
of
the
film
he
team
be
wipe
out
by
a
particularly
mean
vampire
valek
-lrb-
thoma
ian
griffith
-rrb-
who
have
be
tip
off
to
who
crow
be
.
now
crow
team
be
go
and
he
be
down
to
himself
and
he
sidekick
tony
montoya
-lrb-
daniel
baldwin
-rrb-
.
to
make
matter
worse
,
he
do
not
know
the
people
on
he
own
side
,
tony
and
he
backer
,
he
can
trust
.
meanwhile
jack
be
sure
the
vampire
be
look
for
something
that
must
be
hide
somewhere
here
in
new
mexico
.
if
this
be
sound
like
a
very
tired
police
corruption
plot
with
a
few
obvious
substitution
,
that
be
exactly
what
it
be
.
the
same
story
look
just
as
well
with
two
partner
cop
look
for
a
gang
of
hood
who
be
themselves
look
for
a
packet
of
heroin
.
but
carpenter
go
against
a
familiar
principle
of
film
:
show
people
,
do
not
tell
they
.
just
about
everything
in
the
plot
other
than
the
fight
we
be
tell
about
in
the
dialog
and
not
show
.
fundamental
question
in
the
plot
like
where
do
crow
get
he
funding
,
why
be
the
vampire
in
new
mexico
--
what
do
they
want
and
why
do
they
want
it
,
what
be
the
connection
of
the
vampire
and
the
catholic
church
,
how
do
crow
come
to
be
a
vampire
hunter
and
why
devote
he
life
to
it
?
the
answer
to
any
of
these
question
could
have
be
dramatize
,
but
instead
be
reveal
through
dialog
.
now
if
all
this
be
not
bad
enough
,
carpenter
misuse
the
jame
wood
persona
.
wood
play
a
particular
sort
of
cool
lowlife
very
well
.
but
carpenter
lead
off
the
film
by
have
wood
do
some
sergio-leone
-
style
mythic
posturing
.
while
he
crew
prepare
for
a
attack
he
stand
stare
fixedly
through
shades
at
the
house
that
will
be
he
target
.
wood
do
not
work
as
a
larger
than
life
mythic
hero
.
that
be
not
he
style
and
it
just
do
not
work
very
well
.
there
be
some
simple
thing
that
carpenter
should
be
look
for
as
director
that
he
miss
.
in
one
scene
we
be
look
at
a
motel
room
with
dead
people
on
the
floor
.
one
female
corpse
be
on
the
floor
in
front
of
a
chair
so
that
there
be
about
a
inch
of
daylight
between
she
and
the
chair
.
as
the
actress
breathe
the
gap
widening
and
narrow
make
it
obvious
she
arm
be
move
up
and
down
.
one
also
wonder
how
the
existence
of
vampire
be
keep
secret
.
these
vampire
do
not
maintain
a
low
profile
.
there
be
arguably
logical
flaw
in
the
film
.
there
be
some
question
in
my
mind
whether
carpenter
have
a
consistent
policy
on
what
effect
bullet
have
on
vampire
.
it
would
take
some
rationalization
to
explain
why
in
some
scene
sunlight
have
a
dramatic
effect
on
vampire
,
yet
in
a
scene
toward
the
end
a
vampire
can
walk
under
a
burned
roof
that
let
he
be
sweep
by
beam
of
sunlight
.
i
suspect
that
the
book
on
which
this
film
be
base
be
better
think
out
.
while
i
might
recommend
this
film
to
a
action
audience
i
would
say
that
what
i
look
for
in
a
vampire
film
vampire
rate
a
4
on
the
0
to
10
scale
and
a
0
on
the
-4
to
+4
scale
.
perhaps
i
will
read
the
book
.
