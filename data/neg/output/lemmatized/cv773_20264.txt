i
hear
actor
skeet
ulrich
discuss
this
film
in
a
couple
of
interview
,
and
in
both
instance
,
he
feel
the
strange
compulsion
to
compare
it
a
little
series
of
film
call
lethal
weapon
.
now
,
i
personally
remember
those
film
as
a
-rrb-
star
a
major
motion
picture
star
b
-rrb-
be
funny
c
-rrb-
have
great
action
sequence
d
-rrb-
great
chemistry
e
-rrb-
decent
character
development
.
hmmm
...
okay
...
now
on
to
my
review
of
chill
factor
.
plot
:
a
graveyard
shift
regular
work
joe
and
ice
cream
truck
driver
fall
onto
a
malicious
plan
by
a
ex-army
general
,
to
propose
a
nuclear
device
to
international
prospects
.
when
the
device
suddenly
fall
into
they
reluctant
lap
,
they
must
keep
it
cool
on
ice
,
and
rush
it
over
to
a
army
base
,
before
the
contraption
tick
over
50
degree
fahrenheit
,
and
kill
million
of
people
.
critique
:
''
speed
on
a
ice-cream
truck
''
be
probably
the
pitch
that
be
use
to
sell
this
one-tone
movie
to
its
backer
,
but
unfortunately
,
the
only
way
that
anyone
could
compare
this
film
to
that
tension-filled
,
original
two
hour
of
cinema
,
be
in
its
distinct
honor
of
be
the
complete
opposite
of
what
that
film
,
and
the
lethal
weapon
movie
,
stand
for
.
this
film
be
seasoned
in
cliche
,
with
plenty
of
badly
write
dialogue
,
over
the
top
act
from
cuba
gooding
jr
.
,
zero
chemistry
between
the
two
lead
,
and
horribly
tacky
bad
guy
,
toss
in
to
complete
a
overall
bad
movie
recipe
.
my
friend
and
i
enjoy
watch
this
movie
to
a
certain
extent
,
because
some
of
the
line
in
it
be
so
bad
and
obviously
''
write
''
,
that
we
just
have
to
crack
up
.
that
,
and
the
formulum
for
the
film
's
script
which
follow
the
proverbial
1-2
-
,
and
you
guess
it
...
3
scenario
!
and
what
about
all
those
catchy
,
hip
name
to
get
we
to
relate
to
the
character
...
''
elvis
''
and
''
nighshift
''
,
oh
what
talent
lie
in
the
mind
of
these
screenwriter
-lrb-
and
yes
,
it
actually
take
two
guy
to
come
up
with
this
regurgitated
drivel
-rrb-
.
it
be
unfathomable
to
I
as
to
how
actor
skeet
ulrich
and
cuba
gooding
jr
.
get
involve
in
this
one-week-old-blue-cheese-smelling
project
.
do
they
actually
think
that
it
would
boost
they
career
,
or
do
they
know
that
the
script
suck
,
but
discount
any
fall
from
grace
,
know
full
well
that
the
stack
of
cash
in
they
back
pocket
would
pad
they
fall
?
most
probably
the
latter
.
have
you
see
either
flee
or
bulletproof
?
well
,
despite
the
slight
difference
in
plot
,
the
essential
be
basically
the
same
here
.
you
get
a
black
guy
and
a
white
guy
be
chase
by
a
bunch
of
people
,
have
no
choice
but
to
work
together
to
get
somewhere
,
hate
each
other
at
first
,
but
over
time
,
learn
to
respect
one
another
as
individual
.
yawn
.
add
to
that
,
the
fact
that
we
film
actually
have
bad
guy
who
be
all
dress
in
black
,
drive
black
car
and
black
van
,
and
run
around
with
all
kind
of
telecommunicative
device
sprinkle
around
they
head
.
not
too
conspicuous
,
eh
?
call
I
a
party-pooper
,
but
as
much
as
i
like
a
nice
cheezy
movie
as
much
as
the
next
guy
,
this
film
just
do
not
even
try
to
do
anything
original
or
reasonably
entertaining
.
one
cool
scene
with
a
boat
careen
down
a
mountainside
,
and
another
with
a
nuclear
device
obliterate
everything
on
a
island
,
do
not
a
fun
,
buddy-action
flick
make
.
show
