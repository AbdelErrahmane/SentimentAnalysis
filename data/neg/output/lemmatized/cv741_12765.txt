several
day
after
have
see
this
movie
,
i
be
still
try
to
determine
what
director
christopher
guest
,
a
man
whose
sense
of
humor
i
usually
appreciate
,
find
funny
in
either
the
concept
or
the
execution
of
almost
hero
.
this
be
a
dreadful
motion
picture
?
a
lowbrow
example
of
period
piece
comedy
with
terrible
production
value
and
a
exceptionally
poor
laughs-to-joke
ratio
.
there
be
a
kind
of
desperation
in
the
movie
's
approach
to
humor
that
reveal
the
film
maker
'
uncertainty
about
how
entertaining
the
material
be
;
the
manic
style
betray
itself
as
a
last-ditch
attempt
to
hide
the
flaw
of
a
fail
script
.
the
premise
do
not
sound
especially
amusing
to
begin
with
?
almost
hero
tell
the
tale
of
two
explorer
,
the
effeminate
leslie
edward
-lrb-
matthew
perry
-rrb-
and
the
uncouth
bartholomew
hunt
-lrb-
chri
farley
-rrb-
,
who
be
race
lewi
and
clark
on
the
trip
to
the
american
northwest
.
edward
and
hunt
be
accompany
by
the
kind
of
weirdo
we
find
in
road
movie
-lrb-
albeit
of
the
early-19th
century
variety
-rrb-
,
include
a
frenchman
name
guy
fontenot
who
claim
to
speak
hundred
of
language
-lrb-
none
of
which
prove
to
be
useful
-rrb-
,
a
pretty
indian
maiden
who
turn
into
the
obligatory
love
interest
,
and
a
bizarre
man
who
suffer
a
series
of
debilitate
injury
.
along
the
way
,
the
intrepid
explorer
encounter
bear
,
bald
eagle
,
age
native
american
warrior
,
and
a
conquistador
name
hildago
-lrb-
kevin
dunn
-rrb-
who
rave
about
he
beautiful
hair
.
the
explorer
'
trek
take
they
through
forest
,
across
the
snow-capped
rocky
mountain
,
and
over
a
waterfall
.
this
setup
lead
to
a
lot
of
shout
,
a
great
deal
of
lunacy
,
and
very
few
laugh
.
farley
engage
in
he
usual
shtick
of
fall
down
and
bellow
,
but
,
aside
from
a
momentarily
divert
confrontation
with
a
eagle
,
he
heart
do
not
seem
to
be
in
it
.
matthew
perry
,
one
of
the
star
of
tv
's
friend
-lrb-
who
have
some
modest
success
in
the
romantic
comedy
,
fool
rush
in
-rrb-
be
badly
miscast
.
as
a
foil
for
farley
and
a
antidote
to
he
runaway
energy
,
perry
lack
the
necessary
edge
of
the
proverbial
straight
man
.
i
be
not
a
big
fan
of
david
spade
,
and
i
do
not
like
tommy
boy
,
but
at
least
he
and
farley
work
well
together
.
as
far
as
the
support
player
go
,
none
of
they
make
more
than
a
fleeting
impression
.
eugene
levy
be
waste
,
and
kevin
dunn
be
about
as
interesting
here
as
he
be
in
godzillum
.
frankly
,
it
be
a
disappointment
to
see
something
this
dumb
and
ugly
come
from
christopher
guest
,
the
brilliant
comic
force
behind
such
film
as
this
be
spinal
tap
,
the
big
picture
,
and
wait
for
guffman
.
although
guest
get
the
costume
right
,
this
nearly-inconsequential
success
be
no
substitute
for
the
weak
script
and
unfunny
execution
.
the
special
effect
,
such
as
they
be
,
be
execrable
.
for
a
example
of
some
really
poor
blue
screen
work
,
look
at
the
scene
where
the
character
be
shoot
the
rapid
-lrb-
they
be
obviously
get
bucket
of
water
throw
on
they
-rrb-
and
where
farley
be
be
carry
off
by
a
eagle
.
even
though
farley
do
not
have
the
most
stellar
of
act
career
,
he
do
not
deserve
the
kind
of
unfortunate
epitaph
offer
by
almost
hero
.
while
some
of
the
more
outrageous
attempt
at
humor
may
coax
a
few
guffaw
from
12-year
old
boy
,
the
level
of
comedy
in
almost
hero
fall
far
below
the
level
of
sophomoric
.
farley
fan
who
see
this
film
as
a
way
to
say
goodbye
should
be
commend
for
they
loyalty
,
since
it
take
real
stamen
to
stay
seat
for
the
full
run
length
of
this
cinematic
torture
session
.
