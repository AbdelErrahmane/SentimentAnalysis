thus

on

ahm
manage
to
learn
the

by
listen
to
they
fireside
conversation

a
bit
far-fetched
,
it
be
true
,
but
we
have
to
swallow
it
if
this
flick
be
go
to
manage
a
few
line
of
dialogue
amidst
the
grunting

.
well
,
you
get
the
idea
.
just
to
add
some
action
,
there
be
also
a
vike
vs

vike
duel
.
other
movie
insert
scene
between
the
fight
;
these
scene
be
call
character
development
.
i
suspect
that
''
the
13th
warrior
''
have
a
better
script
at
one
time
and
that
it
fall
through
the
crack
because
of
the
tag-team
direction
.
the
movie
start
off
in
the
hand
of
john
mctiernan
-lrb-
you
'll
notice
a
lot
of
similarity
between
''
warrior
''
and
mctiernan
's
''
predator
,
''
include
the
chitter
jungle
sound
-rrb-
.
somewhere
along
the
line
,
mctiernan
bail
and
michael
crichton
take
over
.
crichton
,
whose
novel
''
eater
of
the
dead
''
be
the
basis
for
''
warrior
,
''
have
direct
a
small
assortment
of
goofy
science-fiction
''
thriller
''
:
''
westworld
,
''
''
coma
,
''
''
looker
,
''
''
runaway
.
''
they
result
of
they
consecutive
effort
be
a
murky
and
pointless
movie
.
perhaps
what
''
the
13th
warrior
''
need
more
than
anything
else
be
a
villain
.
the
''
eater
of
the
dead
''
be
a
faceless
mob
in
blackface
.
they
have
no
personality
,
and
by
the
end
they
do
not
even
seem
particularly
threatening
.
the
audience
have
no
target
toward
which
to
channel
its
aggression
.
mctiernan
should
know
about
the
importance
of
a
interesting
villain
;
it
be
he
''
die
hard
''
that
make
villain
seem
fun
and
attract
big-name
star
to
the
evil
role
in
action
film
.
''
the

from
a
lack

,
all
it
can
do
be
echo
what
it
might
have
be

it
might
have
be
a
satisfying
action
film
.
it
might
have
be
a
beautifully-rendered
medieval
epic

it
might
have
be
a
thought-provoking
examination
