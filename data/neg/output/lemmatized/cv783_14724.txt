there
be
not
much
good
about
this
movie
.
not
much
i
can
say
about
the
act
,
direct
,
or
write
that
would
make
you
consider
see
this
movie
.
so
i
'll
get
my
one
good
comment
out
of
the
way
,
at
least
joel
schuemacher
-lrb-
batman
&
robin
-rrb-
do
not
direct
it
or
it
would
be
title
''
technicolor
city
''
.
in
fact
there
be
nothing
colorful
about
this
movie
,
its
dark
and
depressingly
gloomy
right
down
to
the
bitter
end
.
the
plot
have
a
tendency
to
be
interesting
,
but
all
that
pass
while
you
laughing
at
the
ridiculous
thing
throw
into
what
could
have
be
a
fascinating
movie
.
the
plot
be
impossible
to
explain
due
to
how
senseless
it
get
,
so
i
will
just
touch
on
the
bare
minimum
.
john
murdoch
-lrb-
rufus
sewell
-rrb-
awake
in
the
bathtub
of
a
cheap
hotel
,
only
to
find
out
he
have
forget
everything
.
john
must
find
out
who
he
be
before
the
''
stranger
''
-lrb-
a
.
k
.
a
.
mind
erase
alien
-rrb-
find
he
and
use
he
for
they
own
evil
conspiracy
.
during
the
film
some
interesting
point
be
raise
about
human
individuality
,
and
the
existence
of
inherently
evil
people
.
any
of
these
point
however
be
completely
''
erase
''
from
you
mind
as
you
watch
the
actor
stumble
through
the
dreadful
script
.
as
i
mention
earlier
,
nothing
but
the
atmosphere
be
right
in
this
film
.
the
acting
be
bland
,
and
since
there
be
virtually
no
character
development
no
one
seem
to
care
.
the
special
effect
be
low
budget
and
some
even
hilariously
fake
,
a
sign
of
a
true
''
b-movie
''
.
the
direction
be
poor
and
there
be
little
continuity
,
not
that
you
would
expect
it
in
a
movie
switching
reality
constantly
.
lastly
the
script
be
weak
and
have
no
concept
of
reality
,
and
do
not
deserve
to
have
the
word
''
science
''
in
science-fiction
.
if
i
have
not
get
my
point
across
,
i
'll
say
it
more
plainly
:
this
be
a
bad
movie
.
let
hope
the
next
movie
by
alex
''
i
wish
i
be
tim
burton
''
proya
be
at
least
tolerable
.
