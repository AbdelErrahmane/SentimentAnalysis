okay
,
okay
.
maybe
i
be
not
in
the
mood
to
watch
a
mindless
action
movie
;
i
be
the
same
person
that
like
lethal
weapon
iii
,
even
while
admit
that
it
be
not
as
good
as
the
other
.
howewer
,
the
latest
segal
picture
do
not
look
that
bad
,
and
since
none
of
my
friend
would
go
see
a
woody
allen
movie
even
if
i
pay
they
,
i
go
to
see
it
expect
a
mild
die
hard
rehash
.
boy
,
be
i
wrong
!
in
the
first
half
of
the
movie
,
we
be
already
assault
with
segal
's
acting
,
-lrb-
he
be
not
simply
wooden
;
he
be
like
a
wall
-rrb-
,
gratuitous
violence
,
a
incredible
plot
,
sexist
and
even
more
gratuitous
nudity
,
and
bad
line
that
obviously
be
mean
as
joke
.
by
the
end
,
it
be
obvious
that
hundred
of
navy
man
be
no
match
for
thirty
armed
special
force
soldier
.
not
once
in
the
movie
do
segal
appear
worried
or
undecided
,
which
do
not
do
much
for
increase
the
unexistent
suspense
.
of
course
,
in
movie
like
these
,
there
must
be
a
sidekick
,
and
a
love
interest
.
in
these
one
we
be
give
a
two
for
one
package
in
the
form
of
a
playboy
model
-lrb-
in
the
movie
-rrb-
,
which
only
function
as
a
suppose
comic
relief
-lrb-
by
the
way
of
extremely
stupid
unfunny
line
-rrb-
,
and
to
have
water
eye
and
look
away
every
time
something
bad
happen
in
the
movie
.
oh
,
of
course
,
she
appear
naked
from
the
waist
up
,
and
,
of
course
,
segal
kiss
she
at
the
end
after
no
development
of
they
relationship
;
they
do
not
even
seem
to
be
interested
in
each
other
.
i
have
never
see
so
little
chemistry
between
two
people
in
a
movie
.
often
,
the
villain
save
the
movie
;
unfortunately
,
the
villain
here
be
cartoonish
,
stupid
and
unfunny
,
unmenace
.
how
many
movie
have
psycho
ex-special
force
bad
guy
?
too
many
.
i
be
able
to
predict
the
action
all
throughout
the
movie
,
include
the
moment
where
the
sidekick
save
the
hero
from
certain
death
,
the
scene
where
the
bad
guy
can
kill
the
hero
but
proceed
to
explain
he
plan
to
he
,
the
scene
where
we
be
show
the
hero
's
superior
be
stupid
,
the
scene
where
the
bad
guy
lose
he
gun
and
have
to
fight
the
hero
hand
to
hand
,
etc
...
simply
say
,
this
be
movie-making
by
the
number
,
boring
,
and
potentially
offensive
in
go
for
the
lowest
common
denominator
of
the
audience
.
my
recommendation
:
if
you
go
see
it
,
bring
a
watch
.
you
'll
be
look
at
it
for
most
of
the
movie
.
my
.
rent
die
hard
.
read
a
book
.
stare
at
the
sky
.
do
not
waste
you
time
on
this
worthless
piece
of
celluloid
.
the
real
sad
thing
be
that
there
be
a
lot
of
movie
out
that
i
would
rather
have
see
;
once
again
,
drag
in
by
my
friend
,
which
by
the
way
,
like
the
movie
halfheartedly
.
they
probably
like
wrestle
too
