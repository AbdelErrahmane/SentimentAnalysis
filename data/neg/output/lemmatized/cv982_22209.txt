i
remember
really
enjoy
this
movie
when
i
see
it
year
ago
.
i
guess
my
memory
really
suck
.
there
be
very
,
very
little
that
be
funny
in
caddyshack
.
the
laugh
be
few
,
and
far
between
,
and
what
there
be
really
be
not
that
great
.
caddyshack
,
as
the
name
imply
,
more
or
less
center
on
one
young
caddy
work
at
a
exclusive
country
club
.
michael
o'keefe
play
say
caddy
.
why
they
cast
this
unknown
,
fairly
untalented
actor
in
the
lead
role
be
completely
beyond
I
.
the
movie
do
not
seem
to
have
a
real
plot
,
just
a
series
of
scene
that
be
little
more
than
opportunity
for
the
rest
of
the
cast
to
mug
at
the
camera
.
the
only
real
story
,
if
you
can
call
it
that
,
be
a
subplot
involve
the
mentally
disturbed
green
keeper
,
bill
murray
,
who
be
have
he
own
private
little
war
against
a
gopher
who
be
ruin
the
course
.
most
of
the
marginal
laugh
come
from
rodney
dangerfield
and
ted
knight
mugging
and
overacting
for
the
camera
--
with
painfully
limited
success
.
bill
murray
be
slightly
amusing
in
place
,
but
fairly
waste
.
the
biggest
waste
of
all
be
chevy
chase
,
who
do
not
even
crack
a
smile
on
my
face
with
he
character
's
lame
zen-like
approach
to
golfing
.
there
be
a
few
decent
scene
involve
the
interaction
between
dangerfield
and
knight
,
but
they
be
far
too
infrequent
to
carry
the
movie
.
i
guess
that
be
what
you
get
for
base
a
story
around
a
unknown
kid
.
i
be
not
sure
what
the
writer
of
this
thing
be
think
of
,
but
i
really
think
it
be
something
far
remove
from
comedy
as
they
be
put
pen
to
paper
.
nothing
about
this
movie
work
.
it
would
not
have
take
a
genius
to
figure
out
that
this
thing
be
not
go
to
fly
.
most
of
the
scene
just
could
not
possibly
be
funny
.
it
be
as
if
the
writer
where
off
in
they
own
little
brain
damaged
world
.
i
be
sure
scene
involve
chevy
chase
and
he
oneness
with
the
golf
ball
be
suppose
to
be
funny
.
in
reality
,
they
be
painfully
embarrassing
to
watch
.
there
be
a
scene
at
the
club
pool
where
all
the
caddie
go
wild
for
the
''
hot
babe
''
of
the
movie
walking
by
in
she
bikini
.
olive
oil
would
have
fill
out
this
swimsuit
better
than
this
girl
.
everything
about
this
movie
be
just
completely
implausible
as
far
as
the
comedy
be
concern
.
maybe
if
you
be
drunk
out
of
you
mind
or
high
off
some
sort
of
illegal
narcotic
this
thing
might
be
funny
.
but
for
the
rest
of
we
,
stay
the
hell
away
from
caddyshack
.
