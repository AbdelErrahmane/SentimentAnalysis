if
first-time
director
hal
salwen
could
shoot
a
entire
movie
of
character
typing
at
they
computer
,
he
would
.
as
it
be
,
he
settle
for
character
talk
on
the
phone
.
denise
call
up
be
a
movie
for
and
about
the
electronic
generation
,
where
character
be
too
catch
up
with
they
work
and
insecurity
prefer
to
live
out
they
relationship
and
fantasy
on
the
phone
.
it
be
a
satire
-
and
a
sometimes
funny
one
-
about
how
we
let
handphone
,
call-waiting
and
answering
machine
run
we
life
.
the
problem
:
denise
call
up
be
a
movie
about
a
idea
.
a
darn
good
one
,
but
still
a
80
minute-long
idea
.
and
despite
salwen
's
attempt
at
plot
and
sub-plot
,
despite
some
genuinely
funny
moment
,
you
can
predict
the
movie
's
outcome
within
the
first
fifteen
minute
.
you
get
the
drift
after
a
series
of
shot
of
character
explain
over
the
phone
why
they
all
could
not
make
it
for
a
party
-
nobody
be
go
to
be
meet
anybody
in
this
film
,
they
would
rather
be
talk
on
the
phone
.
here
's
salwen
's
plot
:
while
all
the
character
be
in
a
dysfunctional
,
telefixated
limbo
,
loud
quirky
stranger
denise
call
up
martin
to
announce
that
she
be
pregnant
with
he
child
,
courtesy
of
the
sperm
he
donate
to
the
local
bank
.
as
martin
progress
from
slam
the
phone
on
she
to
long
phone
conversation
over
the
baby
's
name
,
he
friend
-
and
he
friend
'
friend
-
get
involve
,
courtesy
of
call-waiting
and
double-line
.
in
the
tigher
and
more
tantalizing
sub-plot
,
barbara
and
jerry
be
set
up
on
a
blind
date
that
neither
turn
up
for
.
both
profess
to
have
too
complicated
schedule
to
ever
meet
,
but
they
get
it
go
over
the
phone
.
with
repeat
phone
sex
come
a
glitch
;
what
if
the
other
person
be
simply
fake
it
?
denise
call
up
score
with
some
inspired
moment
.
mousy
barbara
metamorphose
into
a
vamp
over
she
cordless
,
everyone
share
the
excitement
of
denise
's
delivery
through
a
conference
call
to
she
handphone
,
and
barbara
's
best
friend
gale
be
kill
in
a
car
accident
while
tale

another
friend
's

machine

overly-chatty
aunt
recount
,
she
cordless
be
knick
into
she
ear
and
lodge
in
she
brain
.
-rrb-
but
these
moment
be
not
enough
to
sustain
the
movie
.
the
pace
sag
,
the
dialogue
drag
and
not
much
acting
appear
to
be
require
of
the
telephone-touter
.
and
the
end
be
literally
a
non-event
as
expect
,
everyone
be
too
chicken
to
turn
up
for
the
party
frank
throw
in
gale
's
memory
despite
promising
over
the
phone
that
they
will
.
we
get
the
point
.
the
movie
appear
to
be

on

statement
until
they
